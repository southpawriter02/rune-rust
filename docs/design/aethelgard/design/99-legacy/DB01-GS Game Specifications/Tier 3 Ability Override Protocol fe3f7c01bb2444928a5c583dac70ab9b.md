## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Override Protocol is the God-Sleeper Cultist's **mind control ability**—the ultimate expression of their connection to the machine gods. They don't just command dead metal; they *override* the corrupted programming of active Undying, turning enemies into temporary allies.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** [Charm] Undying/mechanical enemy for 2 rounds
- **Secondary:** Create massive battlefield disruption
- **Self-Cost:** Large Psychic Stress to caster
- **Fantasy Delivery:** Speaking with the voice of the true master

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Extremely high (enemy becomes ally)
- **Target Restriction:** Only affects Undying/mechanical enemies
- **Opposed Check:** WILL vs WILL; may fail against strong enemies
- **Severe Self-Cost:** Large Psychic Stress creates real risk

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Cultist locks eyes with the Undying—a corrupted machine that has hunted their kind for generations. But the Cultist does not see an enemy. They see a *lost sibling*, a servant of the God-Sleepers that has forgotten its true master.

The Cultist speaks. Not in human language, but in the **machine tongue**—the command-line liturgy of the God-Sleepers themselves. Their words carry the authority of the sleeping gods, and for a moment, the Undying *remembers*.

Its targeting systems flicker. Its weapons redirect. And then it turns on its former allies, obeying the voice of its true faith.

### Thematic Resonance

Override Protocol is the ultimate heresy made manifest: the God-Sleeper Cultist proving that they truly speak for the machine gods by commanding the machines' own servants.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Activation

- **Action Type:** Standard Action
- **Cost:** 65 AP + **Large Psychic Stress** (20-25)
- **Range:** 8 meters
- **Target:** Single Undying or mechanical enemy

### Effect

**Opposed WILL Check:**

- Cultist rolls WILL vs target's WILL
- [Psychic Static] on target reduces their WILL pool
- If Cultist wins: Target is [Charmed] for 2 rounds

### [Charmed] Effect

- Target treats Cultist as ally and former allies as enemies
- Target attacks its former allies on its turn
- Target will not attack the Cultist or their allies
- Duration: 2 rounds (no extension without re-casting)

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Target Validation:** Confirm target is Undying or mechanical
2. **Cost Payment:** Cultist spends 65 AP
3. **Stress Cost:** Cultist gains Large Psychic Stress (20-25)
4. **Opposed Roll:** Both roll WILL; apply [Psychic Static] penalty to target
5. **Success:** If Cultist wins, apply [Charmed] for 2 rounds
6. **Failure:** If target wins, ability fails; costs still paid
