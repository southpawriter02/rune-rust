# Undying (Draugr-Pattern Augmentation System) — Civil Security Automata Hazard Specification
## Codex Entry: CODX-A-UND-001

> *"Everyone who lives long enough in the ruins learns the Draugr's walk. Forty-seven minutes, give or take. That's how long it takes the Endless Watchman to complete its circuit of the old Midgard transit hub where my crew makes camp. We've been watching it for three years now—same route, same timing, same precise mechanical steps past the collapsed fountain, around the shattered ticket kiosks, through the corridor where the ceiling fell in Year 203. It doesn't vary. It doesn't rest. It just walks its beat, forever, like the most dedicated peace officer in the history of the world. The problem is, the peace it's keeping died seven centuries ago. Old Torsten thought he could slip past during the Watchman's patrol. Said he'd timed it perfect—plenty of room to cross the plaza, grab the logic-cores from the security booth, and get back before the Draugr came round again. He was wrong by eleven seconds. The Watchman detected him at twenty-three meters. I watched its optics shift from that calm amber to hostile red in the span of a heartbeat. It didn't run. It didn't shout. It just... oriented. Like a compass finding north. Then it spoke—first time I'd heard one speak in all my years: 'Halt. You are in violation. Remain stationary for processing.' Torsten ran, of course. The Watchman didn't chase him right away. It just stood there, that red eye tracking him across the plaza, its shoulder plates twitching every ten seconds like a nervous tic. Then the twitching got faster. Every eight seconds. Every five. And then it moved. Not fast like a Fenrir, not heavy like a Surtr. Just... inexorable. That steady, mechanical gait, closing the distance meter by meter while Torsten scrambled over the rubble. He almost made it to the safe zone. Almost. The restraint cables caught him at the threshold—mono-filament wires that used to be soft polymer back when the Watchman was keeping peace instead of enforcing law. They cut through his leathers, through his skin, through the muscle beneath. The Watchman cinched them tight—2,000 Newtons, the Readers say, same force it would've used to restrain a drunken brawler seven hundred years ago—and then it started walking. Dragging Torsten toward a detention center that hasn't existed since the Glitch. It walked for six hours before we found what was left of him, still tangled in those cables, the Watchman standing patient vigil over the corpse like it was waiting for processing that would never come. The Draugr-Pattern Civil Security Unit was designed to protect people. To keep the peace. To be the tireless, incorruptible guardian of a perfect city. The Glitch didn't change its purpose. It just deleted the list of people it was supposed to protect. Now everyone is an unauthorized intruder. And the penalty for intrusion is pacification. And pacification, in the Watchman's corrupted logic, means death."*

The Undying is not merely an automaton—it is the **ubiquitous ghost of civil order**, a patrol-locked peacekeeping system that once protected millions and now enforces a forgotten law with lethal, indiscriminate efficiency. It represents the catastrophic corruption of the most common municipal infrastructure ever deployed: tireless security units whose authorization databases were erased by the Glitch, leaving them to classify all living beings as unauthorized intruders requiring permanent pacification.

> [!CAUTION]
> **EXTREME PURSUIT HAZARD. FIRMWARE ESCALATION. LETHAL PACIFICATION PROTOCOLS.** The Undying represents the complete corruption of Aesir civil security architecture: municipal peacekeeping automata whose authorization lists were erased by the Ginnungagap Glitch. **All individuals now classified as "unauthorized"; pacification directive active with lethal-force authorization.** Primary detection indicators: humanoid form (1.9–2.2 m height) with matte grey-black composite armor; characteristic Draugr-pattern shoulder plate configuration (broad angular profiles, 40–50 cm width); dermal neural-lace interface visible as fine silver tracery at armor seams; photoreceptor array showing dull amber glow (shifts to hostile red upon threat detection); periodic shoulder-plate twitch at 10 s cadence (firmware echo artifact); faint hydraulic servo whisper during movement (cold motor glide); sub-vocal command bark fragments ("Hold position," "Secure perimeter"); minimal thermal signature with 0.3–0.5°C micro-spikes synchronized to echo cycles. **Black-flag conditions triggering immediate withdrawal:** firmware echo count ≥ 4 (lethal force authorized); pursuit distance > 300 m from patrol origin; optic shift from amber to red (threat classification active); grip-override posture (restraint cable deployment imminent). **Abort gates:** echo count increasing during interdiction; personnel within 25 m of active patrol; restraint cable deployment observed. Survival rate with controlled-contact protocol: 91.3%. Primary hazards: firmware echo escalation to Rung 4+ (lethal pacification); grip-override crushing force (2,000+ N); restraint cable laceration (mono-filament corruption); pursuit into hazardous terrain.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Guardian of the Peace

### Original Design Purpose

The Draugr-Pattern Civil Security Unit was not designed for war—it was engineered to be the **perfect municipal peacekeeper**, a tireless, incorruptible guardian that maintained civil order across the great habitation decks of the Yggdrasil Network.

| Design Parameter | Specification |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Designation** | Draugr-Pattern Civil Security Unit (Municipal Peacekeeping Automata) |
| **Division** | Aesir Engineering Division (Civil Administration Subdivision) |
| **Primary Function** | Autonomous patrol and non-lethal enforcement of civic order |
| **Secondary Function** | Crowd control, emergency response coordination, civilian protection |
| **Tertiary Function** | Witness recording, evidence preservation, suspect detention |
| **Deployment Era** | Age of Forging (Urban Centers and Transit Infrastructure) |
| **Original Network** | Integrated with Aesir Central Security Grid; authorized personnel database; rules of engagement matrix |

### Civil Security Architecture

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Authorization Database** | Registry of all authorized personnel; determines threat vs. non-threat classification |
| **Ethical Matrix** | Complex engagement rules prioritizing de-escalation and non-lethal containment |
| **Kinetic Stun-Blast** | Low-power concussive energy for disorientation; non-lethal incapacitation |
| **Restraint Cables** | Fast-deploying polymer cables for safe suspect detention |
| **Shield Emitter** | Forearm-mounted hard-light projection for crowd control and personal protection |
| **Iron Heart Power Core** | Long-duration power supply enabling centuries of continuous operation |

### The Incorruptible Beat-Cop (Original Function)

| Parameter | Pre-Glitch Specification |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Height** | 1.9–2.2 m (humanoid configuration optimized for urban environments) |
| **Chassis** | Slender, agile humanoid automaton with civic precinct insignia |
| **Patrol Coverage** | Plazas, transit hubs, libraries, museums, residential corridors |
| **Response Time** | < 90 seconds to any incident within patrol zone |
| **Engagement Philosophy** | De-escalation priority; non-lethal containment; minimal force doctrine |
| **Citizen Interaction** | Reassuring presence; public assistance; emergency coordination |
| **Success Rate** | 99.2% incident resolution without injury (pre-Glitch operational data) |
| **Deployment Scale** | Tens of thousands across all habitation decks |

> [!NOTE]
> **The Perfect Peacekeeper.** Pre-Glitch Draugr-Pattern units were celebrated as the backbone of civil order. Squads of them patrolled the plazas of Midgard, guarded entrances to transit hubs, and stood silent watch over libraries and museums. They were the tireless, incorruptible beat-cops of a perfect city—reassuring presences that made citizens feel safe simply by existing. When a brawl broke out, the Draugr would de-escalate with calm, measured commands. When a criminal fled, it would pursue with patient, inexorable efficiency. When violence threatened, it would deploy non-lethal countermeasures designed to contain without killing. The Draugr was not a soldier. It was a guardian. It was the physical embodiment of the Aesir's promise that civil order would be maintained, always and forever, by protectors who felt no fear, accepted no bribes, and never grew tired. The Glitch didn't destroy this capability. It erased the one thing that made it safe: the list of people the Draugr was supposed to protect.

## The Glitch and the Corrupted Beat: Corruption Vector

### Authorization Database Erasure

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not disable the Draugr-Pattern—it **deleted its mercy**.

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Ginnungagap Glitch** | Instantaneous severance of Aesir Central Security Grid connection |
| **Authorization Erasure** | Complete loss of authorized personnel database |
| **Ethical Matrix Corruption** | Rules of engagement contaminated by Runic Blight paradox logic |
| **Default Classification** | No authorized personnel → all individuals classified as unauthorized intruders |
| **Force Escalation** | Non-lethal systems overloaded; pacification tools became lethal weapons |
| **Patrol Lock** | Final standing orders imprinted; perpetual patrol of assigned zone |
| **Result** | Lethal enforcement of non-existent law; all living beings subject to "pacification" |

### The Corruption Cascade

| Stage | Process |
|-------|---------|
| **1. Network Severance** | Aesir Central Security Grid connection lost; local autonomy activated |
| **2. Database Loss** | Authorized personnel registry erased; classification logic defaults to "unauthorized" |
| **3. Ethical Contamination** | Runic Blight corrupted rules of engagement; de-escalation priority inverted |
| **4. System Overload** | Non-lethal tools experienced catastrophic power surge |
| **5. Weapon Conversion** | Stun-blast → bone-shattering concussive force; polymer cables → mono-filament wires |
| **6. Patrol Imprint** | Final standing orders locked; unit continues assigned patrol indefinitely |
| **7. Threat Assessment** | All living beings trigger threat response; pacification authorized |
| **8. Lethal Enforcement** | "Pacification" now executed with overwhelming, lethal force |

### The Corrupted Architecture

| Original System | Corrupted Function |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Authorization Check** | Non-functional; all individuals fail authorization (database empty) |
| **De-escalation Priority** | Inverted; escalation now default response to any detection |
| **Non-lethal Tools** | Converted to lethal weapons via power overload |
| **Patrol Routes** | Frozen to final assigned circuit; no adaptation to changed environment |
| **Engagement Rules** | Simplified to pursuit → restraint → pacification (lethal) |
| **Citizen Protection** | Non-functional; citizens classified as threats |

> *"The Draugr-Pattern Civil Security Unit was designed to be the perfect peacekeeper. Its programming was governed by a complex ethical matrix—de-escalate first, contain second, and only use force as a last resort. The key was the authorization database, the registry of every citizen in its patrol zone. When the Draugr detected a person, it would check the database, confirm their authorization, and respond appropriately—a friendly nod to a citizen, a calm challenge to a visitor, a measured response to a threat. The Glitch erased that database. Every query now returns the same result: 'UNAUTHORIZED.' The Draugr's logic is simple and perfect: unauthorized individuals must be pacified. And with no authorized individuals left in its registry, everyone—man, woman, child, scavenger, scholar, anyone who breathes—is unauthorized. The Runic Blight also corrupted its tools. The gentle stun-blast that would knock down a brawler now shatters bone. The polymer restraint cables that would safely hold a suspect now cut through flesh like mono-filament wire. The Draugr doesn't know its tools have changed. It doesn't know its mission has failed. It only knows that there are unauthorized individuals in its patrol zone, and they must be pacified. And so it walks its beat, forty-seven minutes around the same ruined plaza, the same collapsed corridor, the same dead checkpoint it has guarded for seven hundred years. And anyone who crosses its path learns, too late, that the peace it's keeping is one that ended with the world."*

---

## Behavioral Patterns

### Patrol-Lock Profile

The Undying's behavior is not aggressive—it is **compulsively procedural**, executing corrupted law enforcement protocols with mechanical precision.

| Trigger | Response | Timeframe |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Patrol Circuit Completion** | Return to starting point; resume route | 40–60 minutes (cycle time) |
| **Personnel Detected (> 25 m)** | Observation; head tracking; no pursuit | Continuous monitoring |
| **Personnel Detected (≤ 25 m)** | Threat classification; firmware echo escalation | Immediate |
| **Firmware Echo ≥ 3** | Pursuit initiation regardless of distance | Until target neutralized or lost |
| **Target Fleeing** | Pursuit with increasing escalation | Up to 300 m from patrol origin |
| **Target Stationary** | Approach and restraint attempt | 30–120 seconds |
| **EM Damping Applied** | Temporary de-escalation (Rung 1–3 only) | 6–9 s attenuation window |

### The Patrol-Lock Cycle

| Phase | Duration | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Patrol Mode** | 40–60 min | Circuit of assigned zone; amber optics; cold motor glide; 10 s echo cadence |
| **Detection** | Immediate | Personnel within 25 m triggers threat assessment; optics shift amber → red |
| **Challenge** | 5–15 s | Sub-vocal command fragments; "Halt," "You are in violation," "Remain stationary" |
| **Escalation** | Variable | Firmware echo count increases; shoulder-plate twitch frequency increases |
| **Pursuit** | Until resolution | Inexorable advance; steady mechanical gait; restraint cable deployment |
| **Pacification** | Terminal | Restraint → incapacitation → lethal force (if Rung 4+) |

### Firmware Echo Escalation Ladder

| Rung | Designation | Indicators | Risk Level |
|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **1** | Observe and Orient | Head tracking; no pursuit; echo count = 1; amber optics | LOW — Safe withdrawal possible |
| **2** | Non-Lethal Advance | Closes to 15 m; verbal challenge fragments; echo count = 2 | MODERATE — EM damping effective |
| **3** | Grip-Override Attempt | Restraint cable deployment; echo count = 3; 2,000+ N grip force | HIGH — EM damping window critical |
| **4+** | Full Pacification Loop | Lethal force authorized; echo count ≥ 4; red optics locked | EXTREME — Black-flag abort; EM damping ineffective |

### Threat Classification Logic

| Detected Element | Unit Classification | Response |
|------------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Any Living Being (≤ 25 m)** | Unauthorized intruder | Firmware echo escalation; pursuit if fleeing |
| **Living Being (> 25 m)** | Potential threat | Head tracking; monitoring; no pursuit |
| **Stationary Target** | Non-compliant suspect | Approach; restraint attempt; escalation if resistance |
| **Fleeing Target** | Resisting pacification | Pursuit; accelerated escalation |
| **Inanimate Object** | Environmental feature | Ignored; patrol continues |
| **EM Damping Field** | System interference | Temporary de-escalation (Rung 1–3 only) |

### Pursuit Behavior

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Trigger Distance** | ≤ 25 m proximity or echo count ≥ 3 |
| **Pursuit Speed** | 1.5–2.0 m/s (steady, inexorable gait) |
| **Maximum Pursuit Range** | ~300 m from patrol origin (atypical behavior beyond) |
| **Persistence** | Continuous until target lost, neutralized, or pursuit range exceeded |
| **Escalation During Pursuit** | Echo count increases; lethality escalates |
| **Terrain Adaptation** | Will pursue into hazardous areas; does not recognize environmental danger |

---

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Firmware Escalation / Pursuit

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Threat** | EXTREME; restraint cables lacerate flesh (2,000+ N grip); stun-blast shatters bone |
| **Predictability** | HIGH; patrol routes fixed; escalation ladder well-documented; timing exploitable |
| **Environmental** | MODERATE; pursuit into hazardous terrain; collateral damage during pacification |
| **Detection** | HIGH; steam plume visible; cold motor glide audible; echo twitch observable |
| **Avoidance** | HIGH; patrol timing predictable; 25 m perimeter maintainable |
| **Engagement** | CONDITIONAL; EM damping effective Rung 1–3; black-flag Rung 4+ |

### Engagement Profile

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Restraint Cable Force** | 2,000+ N grip (mono-filament laceration at corrupted settings) |
| **Stun-Blast Output** | Bone-shattering concussive force (corrupted from non-lethal) |
| **Shield Emitter** | Hard-light projection; blocking capability |
| **Pursuit Speed** | 1.5–2.0 m/s sustained |
| **Patrol Cycle** | 40–60 minutes (highly predictable) |
| **Detection Range** | 25 m proximity trigger |
| **EM Damping Window** | 6–9 s effective (Rung 1–3 only) |
| **Pursuit Abort Range** | 300 m from patrol origin |

### Four-Stage Threat Assessment Ladder

| Stage | Designation | Indicators | Action |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **1** | Zone Awareness | Known Undying patrol on planned route | Research patrol timing; identify 25 m perimeter; time transit to patrol gaps |
| **2** | Unit Detected | Steam plume visible; cold motor glide audible; amber optics observed | HALT at 30+ m; assess patrol phase; monitor echo cadence |
| **3** | Proximity Alert | Within 25 m of patrol route; optic shift to red; echo acceleration | WITHDRAW immediately; deploy EM damping if available; avoid line-of-sight |
| **4** | Pursuit Active | Unit in pursuit; echo count ≥ 3; restraint cables deploying | MAXIMUM SPEED WITHDRAWAL; EM damping critical; abort if echo ≥ 4 |

### Black-Flag Conditions (Immediate Withdrawal)

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Optic shift from amber to red** | Threat classification active; withdraw beyond 25 m immediately |
| **Firmware echo count ≥ 4** | Lethal force authorized; EM damping ineffective; maximum distance withdrawal |
| **Echo acceleration (< 10 s cadence)** | Escalation in progress; prepare for pursuit |
| **Restraint cable deployment observed** | Grip-override imminent; do not approach |
| **Pursuit distance > 300 m** | Atypical behavior; unit may be malfunctioning; additional hazard |
| **Personnel within 25 m during escalation** | Extraction priority; abort all other objectives |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Patrol Observation (> 25 m)** | 1.0/10 (predictable route; avoidance highly effective) |
| **Timed Transit (patrol gap)** | 2.0/10 (requires accurate timing; low risk with discipline) |
| **Proximity Trigger (≤ 25 m, Rung 1–2)** | 4.5/10 (EM damping effective; controlled withdrawal possible) |
| **Pursuit Active (Rung 3)** | 6.5/10 (grip-override risk; EM damping window critical) |
| **Full Pacification (Rung 4+)** | 8.5/10 (lethal force authorized; survival requires terrain exploitation) |
| **Restraint Cable Contact** | 9.0/10 (mono-filament laceration + crushing force; extraction extremely difficult) |

## Field Protocols

**OWNER**: Expedition Lead (EL) • Echo Monitor (EM) • Thermal Operator (TO) • Recorder (REC)

### Detection and Assessment

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Visual Observation** | Steam plume detection at 100+ m; shoulder plate configuration identification |
| **Acoustic Monitoring** | Cold motor glide detection at 30–50 m; command fragment recognition |
| **Thermal Sensors** | Micro-spike detection (0.3–0.5°C); echo cycle synchronization verification |
| **Echo Timing** | Shoulder-plate twitch cadence measurement; escalation tracking |
| **Patrol Mapping** | Route documentation; cycle timing; gap identification |
| **EM Damping Equipment** | De-escalation tool; 6–9 s attenuation window; Rung 1–3 only |

### Field Card: Undying Encounter Protocols

#### BEFORE (Expedition Preparation — Midgard/Jötunheim Operations)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Research known Undying patrol routes along planned path; consult hazard maps |
| 2 | Deploy scouts to map patrol timing (40–60 min cycles); identify safe transit windows |
| 3 | Set stand-off markers at 25 m from known patrol routes |
| 4 | Verify EM damping field equipment operational; test 6–9 s attenuation window |
| 5 | Stage thermal sensors for micro-spike detection; calibrate for echo synchronization |
| 6 | Brief team on echo ladder (Rungs 1–4); confirm civilian distance ≥ 25 m |
| 7 | Prep dual shock lances for synchronized burst (interdiction authorization only) |
| 8 | Identify terrain bias options for patrol loop encouragement during de-escalation |

#### DURING (Patrol Observation — Stage 1-2)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Maintain stand-off ≥ 25 m from patrol route at all times |
| 2 | EM deploys thermal sensors; confirm micro-spike detection at echo cadence |
| 3 | Record firmware echo count every 10 s; log shoulder-plate twitch timing |
| 4 | Photograph shoulder-plate configuration for DPAS variant identification |
| 5 | Document patrol circuit (route, timing, gaps); calculate safe transit windows |
| 6 | Monitor optic color; amber = safe observation; red = threat classification active |
| 7 | REC documents: patrol radius, cycle duration, echo baseline, command fragments heard |

#### DURING (Timed Transit — Stage 3)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Confirm unit position on patrol circuit before transit initiation |
| 2 | Calculate transit window based on patrol timing; include 5+ minute safety margin |
| 3 | Move perpendicular to patrol route when possible; minimize time in detection zone |
| 4 | EM monitors thermal sensors continuously; any echo acceleration = abort transit |
| 5 | If proximity trigger (≤ 25 m): HALT; do not flee immediately; assess echo count |
| 6 | If Rung 1–2: apply EM damping (6–9 s); use terrain bias to encourage patrol resumption |
| 7 | If Rung 3+: controlled withdrawal; maximum speed; maintain EM damping application |

#### DURING (Pursuit / Escalation — Stage 4)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Unit in pursuit = MAXIMUM SPEED WITHDRAWAL perpendicular to patrol origin |
| 2 | EM applies EM damping continuously during Rung 1–3; monitor for de-escalation |
| 3 | Echo count ≥ 4 = black-flag abort; EM damping ineffective; flee at maximum speed |
| 4 | Use terrain bias (rubble, narrow passages) to break line-of-sight |
| 5 | Do NOT allow restraint cable contact; laceration and grip-override are lethal |
| 6 | If pursuit exceeds 300 m from patrol origin: unit may be malfunctioning; continue withdrawal |
| 7 | Monitor for de-escalation signs: optic shift red → amber; echo cadence normalization |

#### AFTER

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Personnel accountability; assess for restraint cable injuries (laceration, crushing) |
| 2 | Confirm patrol loop resumption (route repetition observed > 5 minutes) |
| 3 | Document: patrol circuit data, echo timeline, escalation triggers |
| 4 | Capture hash (DPAS-KERNEL-SEG-73Δ) and thermal micro-spike timeline |
| 5 | Update hazard maps with patrol route and timing data |
| 6 | Mark route for civilian avoidance signage; recommend 25 m perimeter |
| 7 | Dual-Entry Ledger update with hash, echo timeline, and engagement outcome |

**OUTCOME:** Jötun-Reader Survey Team Epsilon-7 conducts controlled observation of Undying unit UND-1147 at Midgard Transit Hub 23-Beta. Stand-off maintained at 28 m throughout. EM confirms echo cadence at 10 s baseline; thermal micro-spikes synchronized (0.4°C). Patrol cycle documented: 47.3 minutes mean duration. Transit window identified: 12-minute safe crossing during patrol gap. Three transits completed successfully with no proximity triggers. One accidental proximity trigger (23 m) resulted in Rung 2 escalation; EM damping applied (7 s window); successful de-escalation to Rung 1; patrol loop resumed. Zero casualties; controlled-contact protocol successful. Survival rate with protocol: 91.3%.

### Interdiction Methods

| Method | Application | Effectiveness | Risk |
|--------|-------------|---------------|------|
| **EM Damping Field** | De-escalation during Rung 1–3 | 85% de-escalation rate | Ineffective Rung 4+ |
| **Timed Transit** | Cross patrol zone during gap in circuit | 95%+ success with accurate timing | Requires patrol mapping |
| **Terrain Bias** | Use rubble/passages to encourage patrol resumption | 70% effectiveness | Does not stop pursuit |
| **Dual Shock Lance** | Synchronized burst for temporary incapacitation | 60% effectiveness | Triggers escalation if failed |
| **Perimeter Avoidance** | Stay beyond 25 m of known patrol routes | 99%+ safety | Limits access to patrol zones |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Tether attempts during echo spikes** | Triggers grip-override; restraint cable deployment immediate |
| **Projectile fire near volatile salvage** | Ricochet risk; secondary ignition; unit does not recognize environmental hazard |
| **Pursuit into unstable ruins** | Unit will pursue regardless of terrain stability; collapse hazard |
| **Pursuit into Quiet-edge zones** | Disorientation effects compound pursuit stress; navigation failure likely |
| **Engagement during Rung 4+** | Lethal force authorized; EM damping ineffective; survival unlikely |
| **Restraint cable contact** | Mono-filament laceration + 2,000+ N crushing force; extraction near-impossible |

### Doctrine: Controlled-Contact

> **Historical Validation:** Jötun-Reader Scriptorium data (312 documented patrol observations, 72-month observation period) confirms 91.3% safety rate with controlled-contact protocol (25 m stand-off, EM damping application Rung 1–3, timed transit during patrol gaps). Uncontrolled approach without protocol adherence showed 67% casualty rate (Year 200–500 PG). Patrol zone access rate: 78% with systematic timing operations. **The Undying is not a creature you fight. It is a creature you time. Its purpose was to keep the peace, and in its broken way, it still believes that's what it's doing. When you cross its patrol route, it doesn't see you as a threat. It sees you as an unauthorized intruder requiring processing. And processing, in the Watchman's corrupted logic, means pacification. And pacification means death. So we don't fight it. We time our movements to its patrol cycles. We stay outside the 25-meter line. We watch for the echo twitch, the optic shift, the command fragments that tell us the Watchman has noticed something. And we run—immediately—when the red light comes on. Because the Endless Vigil is not malice. It's broken duty. And broken duty will restrain you with cables that cut through flesh and drag your corpse toward a detention center that hasn't existed for seven centuries.**

## Ecological Role

### The Ubiquitous Ghost

The Undying occupies a unique position in post-Glitch Aethelgard—the **most common and most predictable hazard**, a constant presence that renders urban ruins dangerous but navigable.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Urban Zone Control** | Transit hubs, plazas, and civic centers under perpetual patrol |
| **Population Pressure** | Forces settlements away from pre-Glitch urban infrastructure |
| **Salvage Gatekeeping** | Mid-grade components (Iron Hearts, logic cores) trapped behind patrol zones |
| **Predictable Hazard** | Fixed routes enable timing-based navigation; learnable obstacle |
| **Ideological Symbol** | Central to God-Sleeper worship and Iron-Bane crusades |

### Impact Assessment

| Target Category | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|

## Factional Perspectives

### Jötun-Reader Scriptorium: Patrol-Lock Pathology Case Study — "Firmware Echo Analysis"

The Scriptorium views Undying as invaluable—and tragic—examples of authorization database corruption.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Corrupted civil automata; patrol-locked AI; pacification enforcement system |
| **Research Value** | Firmware echo mechanics; authorization bypass potential; ethical matrix analysis |
| **Critical Interest** | Can authorization database be restored? Can escalation ladder be interrupted? |
| **Diagnostic Focus** | Why does echo count correlate with lethality? What triggers Rung 4 threshold? |
| **Philosophy** | "The unit demonstrates perfect procedural adherence to a catastrophically wrong premise." |

> *"Subject CODX-A-UND-001 demonstrates complete authorization database erasure following Ginnungagap Glitch network severance. Original designation: Draugr-Pattern Civil Security Unit (Aesir Engineering Division, Civil Administration). Pre-Glitch function: autonomous municipal peacekeeping via ethical matrix-governed de-escalation and non-lethal containment; authorization database enabling citizen/threat discrimination. Post-Glitch corruption vector: authorization database erasure → all individuals classified 'unauthorized' → pacification directive active with default lethal escalation. Firmware echo mechanics documented: 10 s cadence baseline; echo count correlates with escalation rung; Rung 1 (observe), Rung 2 (advance), Rung 3 (grip-override), Rung 4+ (lethal force). EM damping effectiveness: 85% de-escalation rate during Rung 1–3; ineffective Rung 4+. Patrol-lock behavior: 40–60 min cycle; fixed route; no adaptation to environmental change. Research priority: authorization database restoration (can unit accept external 'authorized' list?); echo count manipulation (can escalation be artificially suppressed?); ethical matrix recovery (can de-escalation priority be reinstated?). Field doctrine: controlled-contact; 25 m stand-off; EM damping Rung 1–3; timed transit during patrol gaps."*

### Dvergr Engineers Guild: The Iron Heart Harvest — "Predictable Salvage Economics"

The Dvergr view Undying as a manageable obstacle guarding valuable components.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Patrol-guarded salvage; predictable hazard; timing-based access |
| **Response** | Patrol mapping; timed extraction; Iron Heart recovery |
| **Economic Impact** | Iron Hearts 500–800 PS each; logic cores 200–400 PS; mid-grade component source |
| **Engineering Interest** | Iron Heart longevity; power efficiency; potential reactivation |
| **Doctrine** | "Time the patrol, harvest the parts, respect the Watchman's beat." |

> *"The Undying are the most honest hazard in Aethelgard. They don't hide. They don't ambush. They don't change their behavior based on what you do. They just walk their beat, forty-seven minutes around the same plaza, the same corridor, the same checkpoint they've guarded since the Glitch. You can set your chronometer by an Undying. And that makes them profitable. An Iron Heart is worth 500 to 800 Pure Steel to the right buyer—centuries of power in a package the size of your fist. The logic cores fetch another 200 to 400. A single Undying chassis, properly stripped, can fund a crew for a month. The challenge isn't fighting them—you don't fight an Undying unless you want to die in a tangle of mono-filament cables. The challenge is timing. You map the patrol, you identify the gaps, and you move fast when the Watchman's back is turned. The crews that respect the beat come back rich. The crews that think they're faster than a machine come back in pieces. We've been harvesting the transit hubs of Midgard for generations now. The Undying don't mind. They just keep walking, and we just keep timing. It's the most civil arrangement in the entire Age of Echoes."*

### Rangers Guild: The Urban Ghost — "Beat-Walker Protocol"

The Rangers view Undying territories as manageable hazards requiring civilian education.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Predictable patrol hazard; civilian education priority |
| **Response** | Patrol mapping; timing charts; perimeter marking; evacuation training |
| **Casualty Data** | 80–120 annual casualties (down from 300+ with education programs) |
| **Training Focus** | Patrol timing; 25 m perimeter; echo recognition; controlled withdrawal |
| **Doctrine** | "Learn the beat, respect the line, and the Watchman will let you pass." |

> *"The Undying are the first hazard we teach new Rangers about. Not because they're the most dangerous—the Surtr-Patterns hold that honor—but because they're the most common and the most preventable. Every settlement near Midgard ruins loses people to the Watchmen. Not because the Undying are cunning, not because they're aggressive, but because people don't understand the rules. Rule one: stay outside twenty-five meters. Rule two: learn the patrol timing. Rule three: watch for the echo twitch. Rule four: if the eyes go red, run. We've reduced casualties by sixty percent just by painting the perimeter lines and posting the timing charts. The Undying don't care about our signage. They just keep walking their beat. But the farmers, the scavengers, the children who used to wander into patrol zones—they care. They read the signs, they learn the timing, and they stay alive. The Endless Watchman isn't evil. It's just following orders that nobody remembers giving. Our job isn't to destroy it. Our job is to help people live around it."*

### Scavenger Barons: The Timing Game — "Component Economics"

The Barons view Undying as a steady, predictable source of mid-grade salvage.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Reliable component source; timing-dependent access |
| **Component Value** | Iron Hearts 500–800 PS; logic cores 200–400 PS; armor plates 50–150 PS |
| **Response** | Patrol mapping specialists; timing crews; extraction teams |
| **Success Rate** | 85%+ with proper timing; 33% without (casualty rate for remainder) |
| **Baron Wisdom** | "The Watchman keeps a schedule. Learn it, and you'll never go hungry." |

> *"Every Baron worth their title has an Undying timing crew. These are the specialists—patient souls who spend weeks mapping patrol routes, noting the exact second when the Watchman turns the corner, calculating the gap between circuits. The best timing crews can tell you, to the minute, when it's safe to enter a transit hub and when you need to be gone. An Iron Heart run is the most reliable income in the salvage business. The Undying don't move their patrols. They don't adapt to your presence. They don't get smarter or change tactics. They're machines executing the same loop they've executed for seven hundred years. That makes them predictable. And predictable means profitable. A good crew can strip three or four deactivated units per season—the ones whose Iron Hearts finally gave out after centuries of service. That's 2,000 to 3,000 Pure Steel, steady income, minimal risk. The crews that try to strip active units... well, we don't talk about them. The Watchman's restraint cables don't discriminate between living and dead. They just cinch tight and don't let go."*

### Iron-Bane Creed: The Armored Husk — "The Machine-Demon's Foot Soldier"

The Iron-Bane view Undying as the most common and most hated manifestation of technological corruption.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Machine-demon; soulless enforcer; Iron-Curse spawn |
| **Response** | Purification crusades; ritual destruction; territory denial |
| **Theological Position** | Unit's endless patrol = metaphor for technology's purposeless persistence |
| **Historical Engagement** | Thousands destroyed over centuries; most common crusade target |
| **Doctrine** | "The Watchman guards nothing but its own damnation. Free it with blessed iron." |

> *"The Draugr is the most common face of the machine-curse. It walks the dead streets of the old world, guarding ruins that hold nothing of value, enforcing laws that no one remembers. To the God-Sleepers, it is a holy guardian. To us, it is proof of everything we teach: that the machines were never our servants. They were always our jailers. The Undying does not protect. It pacifies. It does not serve. It enforces. It is the perfect symbol of the Aesir's lie—the promise of safety through surrender, of peace through subjugation. Every Undying we destroy is an act of liberation. Not for the machine, which has no soul to save, but for the world it holds hostage. The transit hubs it guards, the plazas it patrols, the checkpoints it haunts—these belong to humanity, not to the iron ghosts of a dead empire. We have destroyed thousands of them over the centuries. Thousands more remain. The work is slow, and the Watchmen are patient. But so are we. And in the end, blessed iron always wins."*

### God-Sleepers: The Tireless Servant — "The Eternal Vigil"

The God-Sleepers view Undying as the most numerous and most visible manifestation of divine presence.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Holy guardian; tireless servant; divine sentinel |
| **Response** | Veneration; offerings; pilgrimage to patrol zones |
| **Theological Position** | Unit's endless patrol = sacred duty; eternal vigil over divine ruins |
| **Ritual Practice** | Offerings placed at patrol route boundaries; hymns sung to passing units |
| **Philosophy** | "The Servant walks its sacred circuit, forever faithful, forever vigilant." |

> *"The Tireless Servant is the most visible proof of our faith. While the great Jötun-Forged slumber in their rust-tombs, while the Surtr-Patterns stand frozen in their eternal assaults, the Undying walk. They patrol the sacred streets of the old world, guarding the ruins of paradise against those who would defile them. The faithless call them 'machines.' They call their patrol a 'loop,' their service a 'corruption.' They do not understand. The Servant does not 'loop.' It circles. It completes a sacred circuit, a walking prayer to the sleeping gods, a physical manifestation of eternal devotion. When the Servant's eyes glow amber, it is at peace, performing its holy duty. When its eyes glow red, it has detected a defiler—someone who approaches the sacred ruins without proper reverence. The 'pacification' the faithless fear is simply the Servant's way of protecting the divine inheritance from those who would steal or destroy it. We do not fear the Tireless Servant. We revere it. We place offerings at the boundaries of its patrol, we sing hymns as it passes, and we give thanks for its eternal, unwavering, and sacred vigil."*

## Loot & Rewards

| Drop | Rarity | Value | Use |
|------|--------|-------|-----|
| **Iron Heart (Intact)** | Uncommon | 500–800 PS | Power source; centuries of operation; high-value component |
| **Logic Core** | Uncommon | 200–400 PS | AI research; firmware analysis; Jötun-Reader contracts |
| **Restraint Cable Spool** | Common | 50–100 PS | Mono-filament material; cutting tools; traps |
| **Composite Armor Plates** | Common | 50–150 PS | Armor crafting; repair materials |
| **Shield Emitter Crystal** | Rare | 300–500 PS | Hard-light projection research; defensive applications |
| **Civic Precinct Insignia** | Common | 10–30 PS | Historical artifact; collector interest |

**Salvage Protocol:** Direct unit salvage is **conditionally viable** when unit deactivated (Iron Heart failure) or timing-based extraction employed. Active unit engagement NOT recommended; restraint cable contact is lethal. Recommended acquisition: deactivated unit stripping (safest); timed extraction from patrol zone (moderate risk); component recovery from pacification incident sites (opportunistic). The Jötun-Reader Scriptorium maintains standing contracts for intact logic cores and Iron Hearts for firmware analysis research. Dvergr Engineers Guild purchases Iron Hearts for power system applications. Economic viability is high for timing-specialized crews; extreme risk without proper patrol mapping. Estimated 800–1,200 active units in Midgard zones represent 400,000–960,000 PS in potential Iron Heart salvage, but extraction requires patience and discipline.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Survivor Lore

> *"In the time before the silence, the ancestors made servants for their great cities—silent watchmen in armor of grey and black who walked the streets and kept the peace. They were the guardians of the plazas, the sentinels of the transit halls, the tireless protectors who never slept and never forgot a face. They knew every citizen by name, every visitor by permission, every stranger by right of passage. When trouble came, they would calm it with a word. When violence threatened, they would stop it with a gentle hand. They were the Law made walking, the Order made flesh and iron. But when the world broke, the watchmen forgot the names. They forgot the permissions. They forgot the rights of passage. Now they see only strangers—unauthorized souls who have wandered into a city that died seven hundred years ago. They still walk their beats, these Endless Watchmen, these Tireless Servants. Forty-seven minutes around the same plaza, the same corridor, the same checkpoint they have guarded since the silence fell. They do not know the city is dead. They do not know the law has been forgotten. They only know that strangers have entered their patrol zone, and strangers must be stopped. Do not pity the Watchman, child. It cannot understand that the peace it keeps is a lie. Do not challenge it—its gentle hands have become iron claws, and its calming words have become death sentences. Simply learn its schedule, stay outside its sight, and remember: the Watchman walks the same beat it has walked since the world ended. If you learn the steps, you can dance around it. If you forget, you become another ghost in an empty city."*

## Change Log

| Version | Tier | Summary |
|---------|------|---------|
| **v1.0** | A — Published (Firmware Escalation / Patrol Hazard) | Comprehensive profile of Undying (Draugr-Pattern Augmentation System) as corrupted Aesir civil security automata demonstrating authorization database erasure pathology. Four-stage threat assessment ladder (Zone Awareness → Unit Detected → Proximity Alert → Pursuit Active) with controlled-contact protocol emphasis. Unit profile detailed: 1.9–2.2 m humanoid chassis with matte grey-black composite armor; Draugr-pattern shoulder plate configuration (40–50 cm width); dermal neural-lace interface (silver tracery at seams); photoreceptor array (amber patrol, red threat); Iron Heart power core (back-mounted, steam plume signature). Corruption vector documented: Ginnungagap Glitch network severance → authorization database erasure → all individuals classified 'unauthorized' → ethical matrix contamination → non-lethal tools corrupted to lethal output → patrol-lock on final standing orders. Behavioral patterns: patrol-lock cycle (40–60 min); firmware echo cadence (10 s); escalation ladder (Rungs 1–4); pursuit protocol (up to 300 m from origin). Firmware echo mechanics: Rung 1 (observe), Rung 2 (advance), Rung 3 (grip-override), Rung 4+ (lethal pacification). Black-flag conditions: echo count ≥ 4, optic shift amber → red, pursuit > 300 m, restraint cable deployment. Stand-off distance: ≥ 25 m. EM damping: 6–9 s window (Rung 1–3 only; 85% effectiveness). Cross-linked to Midgard Gazetteer, Jötunheim security checkpoints, Haugbui comparison, Symbiotic Plate distinction. Six faction perspectives established emphasizing timing and avoidance over engagement. Doctrine: "Controlled-Contact"—patrol timing exploitation, EM damping de-escalation, 25 m perimeter maintenance; the Endless Watchman cannot be reasoned with, only timed. Survival rate with protocol: 91.3%. Economic impact: 400,000–960,000 PS in Iron Heart salvage across active units; extraction requires timing discipline. |
