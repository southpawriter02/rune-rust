# The Saga-Scribe — The Cartographer of a Broken World

> *"The Skald sings of the past to inspire. I study the past to survive the future. Every battle we fought, every ruin we explored, every horror we encountered—all of it is data. Data that can be parsed. Data that can be analyzed. Data that tells us exactly what we will face tomorrow and how to defeat it before the first blow is struck."*
> — Saga-Scribe teaching

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Adept |
| **Role** | Cartographer / Lore Master / Strategic Planner |
| **Path Type** | Coherent |
| **Primary Attribute** | WITS |
| **Secondary Attribute** | WILL |
| **Resource System** | Stamina + Chronicle Pages (unique) |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | Low-Moderate (Psychic Stress from analysis) |

The **Saga-Scribe** is the Adept specialization that embodies the philosophy that the key to surviving the future is to meticulously record, analyze, and understand the past.

They are not just historians; they are **tactical analysts** who see the party's own journey—every battle, every discovery, every failure—as a stream of data to be parsed for exploitable patterns. Their philosophy is one of ultimate preparation. They do not fight the Glitch; they create a **flawless strategy guide** to circumvent it.

To choose the Saga-Scribe is to embrace the fantasy of the **master planner** and the **intelligence officer**. Your saga is not written in your own deeds of combat, but in the countless lives saved by your perfect planning and profound foresight. You are the quiet, intellectual anchor of any expedition, the one who ensures the party is never walking into a ruin blind.

## Core Philosophy: The Cartographer of a Broken World

### The Living Chronicle

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Data Over Instinct** | Every experience is information to be catalogued and analyzed |
| **Preparation Over Reaction** | Battles are won before they begin through perfect planning |
| **Knowledge as Weapon** | Understanding the enemy is more powerful than any sword |

In a reality defined by a "catastrophic compiler error," where the world's own story has been shattered, the Saga-Scribe is the **cartographer of chaos**. They understand that in a broken world, the only reliable map is the one you draw yourself—and the only reliable intel is the intel you gather with your own meticulous notes.

> *"The ruins don't change. The Draugr don't learn new tricks. The Forlorn's attack patterns are consistent within their variant type. Every encounter we survive is a lesson written in blood—our enemies' or our own. I make sure we learn from both. I record every detail. I analyze every pattern. And when we face that threat again, we face it with knowledge. We face it with a plan. We face it prepared."*

Their saga is one of quiet, intellectual heroism—the kind that never makes it into the Skald's songs but saves more lives than any berserker's rampage.

### The Coherent Path

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Source** | Observation; analysis; meticulous record-keeping |
| **Method** | Record → Analyze → Plan → Execute |
| **Cost** | Psychic Stress (from processing corrupted data and traumatic events) |
| **Philosophy** | The past is a strategy guide; the future is a solved puzzle |

The Saga-Scribe walks the **coherent path**. Their power comes not from heretical bargains or corrupted channels, but from disciplined observation and rigorous analysis. However, their interface with the Trauma Economy is **intellectual**—they gain Psychic Stress from the mental strain of analyzing corrupted lore, studying traumatic events, and processing the raw, paradoxical data of a glitched world.

> *"I do not channel the Blight. I do not bargain with corruption. But every time I study a Forlorn's corpse, I am staring into the face of what we might become. Every time I analyze a corrupted data-log, I am processing information that was never meant for human minds. The Psychic Stress is not heresy—it is the cost of knowing too much. And I choose to pay it, because the alternative is walking into the dark blind."*

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Master planner; intelligence officer; the party's brain |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Prepare → Gather Intel → Craft Plan → Execute with Advantage |
| **Success Metric** | Ambushes avoided; weaknesses exploited; battles won before first blow |
| **Decision Space** | What to analyze; which plan to prepare; where to invest Chronicle Pages |

Playing a Saga-Scribe is about **strategic preparation and information warfare**.

Your operational loop is:
1. **Explore**: Use Cartographer's Eye to map the unknown
2. **Record**: Analyze corpses and lore objects for Chronicle Pages
3. **Study**: Use Meticulous Notes to learn enemy abilities
4. **Plan**: Execute Master Plan with accumulated Chronicle Pages
5. **Support**: Provide intel and tactical advantages during combat
6. **Adapt**: Use Author's Decree to rewrite critical failures

> *"I don't swing swords. I don't cast spells. I don't take hits for the party. What I do is ensure that when Gorm swings his sword, he knows exactly where the Draugr's armor is weakest. What I do is ensure that when Grizelda casts her spell, she's targeting the Revenant's one vulnerability. What I do is ensure that when we walk into that tomb, we already know what's waiting for us—and we have a plan to destroy it."*

You are the party's **intelligence officer**—the specialist whose contribution is measured in the ambushes avoided, the weaknesses exploited, and the battles won before the first blow was ever struck.

### The Trade-Off

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Unparalleled preparation and planning | Zero direct combat capability |
| Party-wide buffs and tactical advantages | Power is entirely preparatory (out-of-combat) |
| Reveals enemy abilities and weaknesses | Useless if ambushed without preparation time |
| Perfect synergy with every specialization | Extremely vulnerable if caught alone |

The Saga-Scribe has **no direct combat capability whatsoever**. They cannot attack. They cannot defend. They cannot heal. Their entire value is in the preparation and knowledge they provide before the fight begins.

> *"If I am caught alone in an ambush, I am dead. There is no sugar-coating this. I cannot fight. I cannot run fast enough. I cannot survive a sustained assault. My power is in the planning, not the execution. This is why I never walk point. This is why I always have an escape route mapped. This is why the party protects me—because if I fall, they lose their eyes, their ears, and their strategic advantage."*

## Core Mechanics: The Three Pillars

### Pillar 1: Saga Analysis

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Analyze past events and turn knowledge into tangible advantages |
| **Method** | Study corpses, lore objects, and combat data |
| **Output** | Chronicle Pages (unique resource) + Bestiary entries |
| **Limitation** | Out-of-combat only; requires time and focus |

**Saga Analysis** is the foundational mechanic—the process of distilling raw experience into usable knowledge.

| Activity | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Analyze defeated enemy corpse | +1 Chronicle Page |
| Analyze new lore object | +1 Chronicle Page |
| Analyze with Meticulous Notes | +1 Chronicle Page + chance to learn enemy ability |

> *"Every corpse tells a story. The angle of the killing blow. The wear patterns on the armor. The residual Aetheric signatures in the corrupted flesh. To the untrained eye, it's just a dead Draugr. To me, it's a data point. It's information. It's another entry in my chronicle that will help us survive the next encounter."*

### Pillar 2: Chronicle Pages (Unique Resource)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Generation** | Record Entry ability (25 Stamina, out of combat) |
| **Maximum** | No hard cap (accumulates between rests) |
| **Spending** | Crafting abilities; Master Plan; Saga Maps |
| **Function** | Fuel for all Saga-Scribe strategic abilities |

**Chronicle Pages** represent the Saga-Scribe's accumulated knowledge—distilled insights that can be spent for tactical advantages.

| Usage | Chronicle Page Cost |
|-------|---------------------|
| Craft Scroll of Hindsight | Variable |
| Exploit Pattern | 1 |
| Craft Saga Map | High (multiple pages) |
| Master Plan | 3 |

> *"Chronicle Pages are not paper. They are understanding. Each page represents a lesson learned, a pattern identified, a weakness catalogued. When I spend a Chronicle Page on a Master Plan, I am not reading from a book—I am drawing upon a lifetime of accumulated tactical knowledge to give the party an edge. Each page spent is a lesson applied."*

### Pillar 3: Cartographic Mastery

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Unparalleled spatial awareness and navigation |
| **Benefit** | Detailed minimap; reveals adjacent unexplored rooms; hidden paths |
| **Scaling** | Improves with tier progression |
| **Unique Value** | Only specialization with enhanced exploration awareness |

**Cartographic Mastery** represents the Saga-Scribe's natural talent for spatial awareness—they see the world as a map waiting to be drawn.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enhanced Minimap** | More detailed than standard; shows adjacent unexplored rooms as "?" |
| **Path Detection** | Reveals hidden paths and safe routes others cannot see |
| **Trap Awareness** | Higher chance to detect environmental hazards |

> *"The world is a broken labyrinth, and I am its cartographer. Where others see a wall, I see a door that hasn't been opened in a thousand years. Where others see a dead end, I see the seams where the Glitch has stitched two incompatible sections of reality together. I don't just walk through the ruins—I map them. And my maps save lives."*

---

## Abilities: The Path of the Chronicler

### Tier 1 — Foundational Knowledge

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Cartographer's Eye** | Passive | — | Enhanced minimap; reveals adjacent unexplored rooms |
| **Record Entry** | Active | 25 Stamina | Out of combat; generates 1 Chronicle Page from corpse/lore |
| **Craft Scroll of Hindsight** | Crafting | Chronicle Pages | Create consumable allowing ally re-roll |

**Cartographer's Eye** is the foundation—the spatial awareness that makes the Saga-Scribe invaluable for exploration.

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Minimap Enhancement | Adjacent rooms revealed as unexplored outlines (?) |
| Secret Detection | Bonus to perceive hidden doors and passages |
| Trap Awareness | Increased chance to detect environmental hazards |

> *"My training began with the fundamental art of spatial awareness. I learned to see the world as a map waiting to be drawn. Every room has exits—some obvious, some hidden. Every corridor has a logical flow—unless the Glitch has broken it. I see the patterns that others miss. I see the map that the world itself has forgotten."*

**Record Entry** is the bread-and-butter resource generator—the act of analysis that fuels everything else.

| Rank | Stamina Cost | Effect |
|------|--------------|--------|
| Rank 1 | 25 | Generate 1 Chronicle Page from fresh corpse or lore object |
| Rank 2 | 20 | Reduced cost; same effect |
| Rank 3 | 20 | Free Action (with Capstone); same effect |

> *"I kneel beside the fallen Draugr and begin my work. The angle of entry of Gorm's axe tells me about the creature's defensive posture. The corrosion patterns on its armor tell me about the environmental conditions of its lair. The residual Aetheric signatures tell me about its power source. Every detail is recorded. Every observation becomes a Chronicle Page—a piece of knowledge I can spend later to save our lives."*

**Craft Scroll of Hindsight** is the first crafting ability—the "tactical do-over" in written form.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Cost | Chronicle Pages (variable by rank) |
| Output | [Scroll of Hindsight] consumable |
| Effect | Allows single ally to re-roll one failed skill check or attack roll |
| Crafting Location | Camp (out of combat) |

> *"By analyzing our past failures, I can create a detailed scroll of tactical advice. When an ally reads the scroll in a critical moment, they gain a flash of insight—a memory of a lesson learned—that allows them to attempt the action again with new knowledge. This is not magic. This is the power of preparation. This is a 'do-over' in written form."*

### Tier 2 — Advanced Analysis

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Exploit Pattern** | Active | 1 Chronicle Page | Party gains +1 die vs specific Faction for next combat |
| **Meticulous Notes** | Passive | — | Record Entry can reveal enemy special abilities |
| **Craft Saga Map** | Crafting | Many Chronicle Pages | Reveals hidden dungeon/POI on world map |

**Exploit Pattern** is the primary preparatory buff—turning analysis into tactical advantage.

| Rank | Cost | Effect |
|------|------|--------|
| Rank 2 | 1 Chronicle Page | +1 die to Accuracy vs chosen Faction for next combat |
| Rank 3 | 1 Chronicle Page | +1 die to Accuracy + Damage vs chosen Faction |

> *"After analyzing our combat data against the Undying, I devised a counter-strategy. I identified the recurring patterns in their attack routines. I catalogued the structural weaknesses in their corrupted forms. I mapped the optimal angles of attack. Now, when we face the Undying again, the entire party gains a bonus—because I've already solved the puzzle of how to kill them."*

**Meticulous Notes** is the intelligence-gathering passive—learning enemy secrets.

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Primary | When using Record Entry, chance to learn one enemy special ability |
| Permanent | Learned abilities added to Bestiary |
| Synergy | Enables Living Legend warning system |

> *"My analysis becomes more profound. I don't just see what happened; I understand *why*. When I study that Draugr Jarl's corpse, I don't just record its death—I deduce its capabilities. I reverse-engineer its attack patterns from the evidence. And that knowledge is permanently added to our Bestiary. Next time we face a Draugr Jarl, we'll know exactly what it can do."*

**Craft Saga Map** is the exploration crafting ability—revealing hidden locations.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Cost | High (multiple Chronicle Pages) |
| Output | [Saga Map] consumable |
| Effect | Reveals location of hidden dungeon or point of interest on world map |
| Method | Piecing together geographical clues from lore logs and surveys |

> *"By cross-referencing disparate geographical clues from a dozen lore fragments and my own surveys, I can chart a course to a location that no living person has visited in centuries. The Saga Map is not a guess—it is a logical deduction. It is the accumulated knowledge of a thousand hours of research, distilled into a single, actionable piece of intelligence."*

### Tier 3 — Mastery of the Chronicle

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Master Plan** | Active | 3 Chronicle Pages | Out of combat; grants powerful party-wide buff |
| **Living Legend** | Passive | — | Warning flashes before enemy uses revealed ability |

**Master Plan** is the signature strategic ability—the perfect synthesis of accumulated knowledge.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Cost | 3 Chronicle Pages |
| Timing | Out of Combat Only |
| Duration | Next combat encounter |
| Options | Choose one of three plans |

| Plan | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Plan: Attrition** | Party gains damage resistance |
| **Plan: Alpha Strike** | Party gains bonus damage for first 2 rounds |
| **Plan: Coherent Defense** | Party gains bonus resistance to Psychic Stress |

> *"Before we enter the tomb, I outline a detailed, multi-faceted strategy for the entire party. This is not a vague pep talk—it is a precise tactical briefing. I assign positions. I identify priority targets. I outline contingencies. By the time we breach that door, every member of the party knows exactly what to do. The battle is half-won before it begins."*

**Living Legend** is the predictive passive—the border between analysis and prophecy.

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Trigger | Enemy prepares to use ability revealed by Meticulous Notes |
| Output | Warning flashes in combat log before ability executes |
| Benefit | Party has time to prepare/react |

> *"My understanding of narrative causality becomes so complete that my analysis borders on the prophetic. When we face an enemy whose abilities I've studied, I can *feel* when they're about to use a special attack. The warning flashes in my mind a split second before they act. 'INCOMING: Frost Breath!' I shout, and the party has just enough time to brace or scatter. This is not magic. This is pattern recognition at its absolute peak."*

### Capstone — The Unwritten Chapter

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Passive** | Record Entry becomes a Free Action |
| **Active — Author's Decree** | Once per combat, change one die result to 10 (success) |
| **Cost** | Large amount of Psychic Stress |
| **Target** | Any single die roll (ally or enemy, after roll) |

The capstone **The Unwritten Chapter** is the moment the Saga-Scribe transcends mere recording to become a **true author of their own saga**.

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│       THE UNWRITTEN CHAPTER ACTIVATED       │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘


> *"I have transcended mere recording. I am no longer just the chronicler of our saga—I am its author. In a moment of supreme insight, I can reach into the flow of causality itself and add a new verse of my own choosing. Gorm's axe was going to miss? Not anymore. The roll is changed. The hit lands. This is not magic—this is the ultimate expression of understanding narrative causality so completely that I can edit it. But the cost... the cost is staring into the raw code of reality and forcing it to bend to my will. The Psychic Stress is immense."*

## Systemic Integration

### The Party's Intelligence Officer

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Primary Function** | Strategic planning; intelligence gathering; exploration support |
| **Power Source** | Analysis; preparation; accumulated knowledge |
| **Unique Contribution** | Only specialization with pre-combat party buffs and enemy intel |

The Saga-Scribe is the **party's Intel Officer and Strategist**. Their power is almost entirely preparatory. They make the entire party more efficient and resilient by providing them with knowledge and powerful, targeted buffs before a fight even begins.

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Coherent (intellectual trauma interface) |
| **Corruption Sources** | None |
| **Psychic Stress Sources** | Analyzing corrupted lore; studying traumatic events; Author's Decree |
| **Trauma Economy Role** | Moderate intellectual cost; no heretical corruption |

The Saga-Scribe's interface with the Trauma Economy is **intellectual**:
- Analyzing corrupted data-logs = Psychic Stress
- Studying Forlorn corpses = Psychic Stress
- Using Author's Decree = Large Psychic Stress

> *"I don't gain Corruption. I don't channel the Blight. But every time I stare into the face of what the Glitch has done to this world—every time I process information that was never meant for human minds—I pay a price. The Psychic Stress accumulates. The nightmares come. But I would rather know too much than die ignorant."*

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Damage Dealers** | Exploit Pattern provides accuracy bonus; enemy weaknesses revealed |
| **Tanks** | Master Plan: Attrition provides damage resistance |
| **Controllers** | Enemy ability warnings enable better timing |
| **Healers** | Reduced incoming damage means less healing needed |
| **Everyone** | Scrolls of Hindsight provide re-rolls for critical moments |

**The Perfect Synergy Class:**

The Saga-Scribe has **perfect synergy with every other specialization**:
- By revealing enemy abilities and weaknesses, they make Damage Dealers more lethal
- By providing damage resistance, they make Tanks more durable
- By warning about incoming special attacks, they make Controllers more effective
- By reducing overall party damage taken, they make Healers' jobs easier

> *"I make everyone better. That is my role. That is my value. The Veiðimaðr's arrow finds the weak point I identified. The Skjaldmær's shield catches the blow I predicted. The Bone-Setter has fewer wounds to heal because my Plan: Attrition reduced incoming damage. I don't appear in the kill statistics. I don't show up on the healing meters. But without me, half those victories would have been defeats."*

**Negative Synergies:**

| Situation | Issue |
|-----------|-------|
| **Ambush encounters** | No time to prepare; buffs not active |
| **Fast-paced parties** | May not have time to analyze between fights |
| **Solo play** | Completely unviable; zero combat capability |
| **Impatient players** | Preparation takes time; not for action-focused players |

### Situational Power Profile

| Condition | Effectiveness |
|-----------|---------------|
| **God-Tier** | Prepared expeditions; repeat encounters; dungeon exploration |
| **Standard** | Mixed encounters with some prep time |
| **Weak** | Fast-paced combat; no time between fights |
| **Useless** | Ambushes; solo encounters; immediate combat |

---

## Lore Integration

### The Chronicler's Tradition

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Heritage** | Descended from pre-Glitch historians and cartographers |
| **Philosophy** | "The past is a solved puzzle; the future is the next problem" |
| **Method** | Observation, recording, analysis, planning |
| **Status** | Respected as invaluable support; never celebrated as heroes |

The Saga-Scribes descend from the **chroniclers and cartographers** of the pre-Glitch world—those whose job it was to record, map, and analyze. In the post-Glitch chaos, their skills became survival tools. Where the Skald preserves the past through song, the Saga-Scribe **weaponizes** the past through analysis.

> *"The Skalds sing of heroes. They preserve the great deeds in verse and meter. I do something different. I don't preserve the past—I *use* it. Every battle we've fought is a data point. Every enemy we've killed is a lesson. Every ruin we've explored is a map that might save us in the next one. The Skald makes the past beautiful. I make the past *useful*."*

### The Saga-Scribe's Philosophy

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Data Over Glory** | Records are more valuable than reputation |
| **Preparation Over Heroism** | A good plan prevents the need for heroic sacrifice |
| **Knowledge as Power** | The enemy you understand is the enemy you defeat |

The Saga-Scribe's power is not magic—it is **information science applied to survival**. They understand that in a broken world, knowledge is the only reliable weapon.

> *"The Berserkr charges in screaming. Sometimes they win. Sometimes they die. The Saga-Scribe never charges in. The Saga-Scribe waits until the Berserkr has killed something, then analyzes the corpse, records the patterns, and ensures that next time, the Berserkr's charge is optimized for maximum effect. I don't make heroes. I make heroes *effective*."*

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Jötun-Readers** | Kindred spirits; "fellow devotees of analysis and documentation" |
| **Skalds** | Professional respect; "they record what we sing; both are necessary" |
| **Warriors** | Practical appreciation; "they make our jobs easier" |
| **Iron-Banes** | Valued support; "their intel saves Bane lives" |
| **General Population** | Overlooked; "the quiet ones who never seem to fight" |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the Age of Echoes, when the Great Glitch shattered the world's story and left reality a broken labyrinth, the Saga-Scribes emerged as the cartographers of chaos. They are not warriors or mystics—they are tactical analysts who believe that the key to surviving the future is to meticulously record, analyze, and understand the past. They see every battle as data, every corpse as information, every ruin as a map waiting to be drawn. Their power is the power of preparation—the ability to walk into any encounter with a perfect plan already formed. They generate Chronicle Pages by analyzing defeated foes and corrupted lore, then spend those pages on powerful strategic abilities: faction-specific combat bonuses, consumable re-rolls, and the legendary Master Plan that grants party-wide advantages before battle begins. Their Meticulous Notes can reveal enemy special abilities, and their Living Legend passive provides split-second warnings before those abilities activate. At the height of their power, they can use Author's Decree—reaching into the flow of narrative causality itself to change a single die roll, transforming failure into success at the cost of immense Psychic Stress. They have no direct combat capability whatsoever; their saga is written not in their own deeds, but in the countless lives saved by their perfect planning and profound foresight. They are the quiet intellectual anchors of expeditions, the ones who ensure the party never walks into the dark blind. The past is their weapon. The future is their solved puzzle."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Saga-Scribe (Cartographer) represents the coherent Adept specialization optimized for strategic preparation and intelligence gathering. Mechanical role: pure support with zero combat capability. Core mechanics: Saga Analysis (distill experience into knowledge), Chronicle Pages (unique resource generated by Record Entry), Cartographic Mastery (enhanced minimap and exploration awareness), and Preparatory Buffs (pre-combat party advantages). Key differentiator: only specialization with pre-combat party-wide buffs and enemy ability revelation. Signature ability: Master Plan (3 Chronicle Pages, out of combat, grants choice of Attrition/Alpha Strike/Coherent Defense buff to entire party). Trauma Economy integration: Coherent; intellectual interface; Psychic Stress from analyzing corrupted lore and traumatic events, major Psychic Stress from Author's Decree capstone. Social function: party's intelligence officer; invaluable support role; overlooked in heroic narratives. Optimal deployment: dungeon expeditions requiring exploration; repeat encounters against known factions; parties with time for preparation; synergy with every combat specialization. Vulnerability: zero combat capability; useless in ambushes; cannot function solo."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Saga-Scribe (Cartographer). ARCHETYPE: Adept. PATH TYPE: Coherent. ROLE: Cartographer / Lore Master / Strategic Planner. PRIMARY STAT: WITS. SECONDARY STAT: WILL. RESOURCE: Stamina + Chronicle Pages (unique). CORE MECHANICS: Saga Analysis (analyze past events for tangible advantages), Chronicle Pages (unique resource from Record Entry), Cartographic Mastery (enhanced minimap, reveals adjacent rooms, detects hidden paths), Preparatory Buffs (pre-combat party advantages). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Knowledge): Cartographer's Eye (passive, enhanced minimap, adjacent rooms revealed), Record Entry (25 Stamina, out of combat, +1 Chronicle Page from corpse/lore), Craft Scroll of Hindsight (crafting, Chronicle Pages → consumable re-roll). T2 (Advanced Analysis): Exploit Pattern (1 Chronicle Page, party +1 die vs specific Faction next combat), Meticulous Notes (passive, Record Entry can reveal enemy abilities, permanent Bestiary entry), Craft Saga Map (crafting, many Chronicle Pages → reveal hidden dungeon/POI). T3 (Mastery of Chronicle): Master Plan (3 Chronicle Pages, out of combat, party buff—Attrition [damage resist] OR Alpha Strike [+damage rounds 1-2] OR Coherent Defense [Psychic Stress resist]), Living Legend (passive, warning before enemy uses revealed ability). CAPSTONE: The Unwritten Chapter (passive: Record Entry → Free Action; active—Author's Decree: once per combat, Reaction, change one die to 10, large Psychic Stress). TRAUMA ECONOMY: Coherent; Psychic Stress from analyzing corrupted lore/traumatic events/capstone; no Corruption. COMBAT CAPABILITY: None."*

---

## Summary

The Saga-Scribe is the **cartographer of a broken world**.

They are Adepts who have weaponized the past, turning meticulous record-keeping and tactical analysis into tangible combat advantages. They generate Chronicle Pages by analyzing defeated enemies and corrupted lore, then spend those pages on powerful strategic abilities: faction-specific accuracy bonuses, consumable re-rolls, hidden location revelations, and the legendary Master Plan that grants party-wide buffs before battle begins.

Their gameplay is entirely **preparatory**. They have zero direct combat capability—no attacks, no defenses, no healing. Their entire value is in the intelligence they gather, the plans they craft, and the advantages they provide before the first blow is struck. They are the party's intelligence officer, the quiet brain trust whose contribution is measured in ambushes avoided, weaknesses exploited, and battles won through perfect preparation.

The capstone The Unwritten Chapter represents the ultimate expression of their philosophy—the moment they transcend mere recording to become true authors of their own saga, capable of reaching into narrative causality itself to change a die roll and transform failure into success.

They are never the heroes of the Skald's songs. They are the reason those heroes survived long enough to become legends.

*"The past is data. The future is a solved puzzle."*
*"Battles are won before they begin."*
*"My saga is written in the lives I saved,*
*not the enemies I killed."*
