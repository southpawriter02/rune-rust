## 2026-01-30 - Legacy Audit Initiation
**Design Constraint:** Legacy entities in `EntityTableSeeder.cs` use explicit "Magical" tags and prohibited terminology which violate Domain 3 (No "Magic") and Domain 4 (Technology as Theology) standards.
**Solution:** Initiated `docs/99-legacy/entities.md` to stage these entities. Added "Legacy Violations" section to explicitly flag these terms for replacement with "Aetheric Manipulation" and "Post-Glitch" vocabulary during V5.0 migration.
