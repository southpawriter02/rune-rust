## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Memory Siphon is the Seiðkona's **combat divination ability**—the power to tear tactical information directly from an enemy's mind, revealing their weaknesses while leaving them psychically vulnerable. This bridges their utility role with direct combat impact.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Reveal enemy weaknesses and resistances
- **Secondary:** Apply [Exposed] debuff (reduced Defense)
- **Self-Cost:** Moderate Psychic Stress (mental combat is taxing)
- **Fantasy Delivery:** Psychically excavating an enemy's secrets

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High (tactical information + debuff)
- **Single Target:** Focus fire enabler
- **Psychic Cost:** Prevents spam
- **Combat Integration:** Direct application of archaeologist skills

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Seiðkona locks eyes with their enemy and *reaches*. Not physically—their hand never moves—but their mind extends like a grasping claw, piercing the creature's thoughts. They are not looking for memories, not this time. They are looking for **fear**.

Every creature fears something. Every warrior has a wound that never healed, a technique they cannot counter, a vulnerability they pray no one discovers. The Seiðkona finds these secrets in the fractured landscape of the enemy's mind and *takes* them.

The creature staggers, suddenly aware that its deepest weaknesses have been laid bare.

### Thematic Resonance

Memory Siphon is the Seiðkona as **psychic predator**—using their gift to expose and exploit rather than to communicate and understand. It is a darker application of their power, but no less effective.
