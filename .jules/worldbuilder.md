## 2025-05-21 - Establishing the Golden Standard
**Design Constraint:** The repository lacked the referenced "Golden Standard" files (`berserkr/overview.md`) and the "Legacy" source files (`runasmidr.md`) mentioned in the agent persona.
**Solution:** I have established the `docs/03-character/specializations/` directory and recreated the `Berserkr` specification from the agent description to serve as the true Golden Standard. The `Runasmidr` specification is being "migrated" from the implicit knowledge base (persona instructions) rather than a physical file.
