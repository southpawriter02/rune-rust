The **Rúnasmiðr** is the programmer of a broken reality.

They are not wild casters or swaggering wizards. They are **system debuggers**—quiet, methodical scholar-artisans who interface directly with the corrupted source code of the world and attempt to write small, elegant patches of stable code. Their magic is not a torrent of energy but a precise, exacting, and perilous act of **imposing logical order onto a system that has gone insane**.

While the Galdr-caster brute-forces commands through the static and the Echo-Caller weaponizes the scream, the Rúnasmiðr works to contain and repair. Their power lies in their profound understanding of the Futhark's "cosmic grammar" and their unwavering Wits and Will to execute it flawlessly amidst the chaos.

Their saga is a meticulous chronicle of every bug patched, every firewall raised, and every corrupted file contained.

## Core Philosophy: The Art of Stable Code

### The Three Principles

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Measure Twice, Cut Once** | Precision prevents catastrophe; hasty code breaks worlds |
| **Stable Scripts Over Spectacle** | Small, reliable patches outperform grand, chaotic invocations |
| **Power is What Remains When Noise is Removed** | True strength comes from filtering the Blight, not embracing it |

The Rúnasmiðr's creed is not written in saga or scripture. It is written in the **language of code**—syntax, firewall, patch, and the precise accounting of what is stable and what is noise.

> *"The Skalds sing of the great Runesmiths of old as figures of immense, almost casual power. But the Scribes of the Scriptorium have a different, more reverent name for the masters of their most secret and dangerous art. They call them the Rúnasmiðr, the Smiths of the Word. They are not trying to reclaim the power of the gods; they are engaged in a far more difficult and far more important task: the slow, painstaking, and generational effort of debugging the very source code of a broken reality."*

This is not magic as the surface world understands it. This is **programming**—the careful inscription of stable, coherent subroutines into the broken operating system of the world.

The Rúnasmiðr does not seek to mimic the past or to embrace the chaos. They seek, with the slow, patient, and unyielding force of pure reason, to **fix it**.

### The Coherent Path

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Source** | Runic inscription and precise syntax, not heresy |
| **Method** | Runeforging (out-of-combat), Runic Traps (in-combat), Analysis |
| **Cost** | Low Psychic Stress from Debug Enemy; no self-Corruption |
| **Philosophy** | The Blight is noise to be filtered, not power to be embraced |

Unlike the Rust-Witch who accelerates entropy or the Blót-Priest who pays in blood, the Rúnasmiðr maintains **coherent discipline**. They prove that Mystics don't need a Corruption spiral—that safe, sustainable magic is possible through precise inscription.

This is a sustainable path—demanding in preparation, but not self-destructive.

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Arcane artisan; the force multiplier who enhances everyone |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Prepare → distribute → control → analyze → support |
| **Success Metric** | Party enhanced with charged gear; battlefield controlled with traps |
| **Decision Space** | Crafting priorities, charge distribution, trap placement, analysis timing |

Playing a Rúnasmiðr is about **preparation and distribution**.

You don't make yourself stronger—you make the entire party stronger. Before combat, you craft enchanted gear at the Forge, imbuing weapons with Bull's Strength charges and armor with Warding Runes. During combat, you place invisible runic traps that impose zones of coherent reality, control enemy movement, and reveal vulnerabilities through careful analysis.

> *"Your power is not in the stories you tell or the wounds you inflict. It is in the steel that sings with your inscription, the ground that bites when stepped, and the stable code you write into a screaming world."*

Your power is **force multiplication**. A Rúnasmiðr doesn't carry the party—they elevate it. The Warrior's weapon strikes harder because of your Uruz inscription. The tank's armor holds because of your Algiz ward. The enemy stumbles into your trap and the entire formation collapses.

## Abilities: The Runic Arsenal

### Tier 1 — Foundational Glyphs

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Master Carver I** | Passive | — | +1d10 to all Forging Pool (WITS + WILL) checks; reduced Corruption risk from \[Blighted\] components |
| **Debug Enemy** | Active | 30 AP | WITS + WILL check; reveals Resistances/Vulnerabilities; Critical Success reveals behavioral glitch |
| **Uruz Imbuement** | Crafting | — | Imbue weapon with 3 "Bull's Strength" charges; activate as free action for +2d10 damage |

**Master Carver I** represents the discipline to create a perfect form amidst chaos. The Rúnasmiðr's training begins with the steadiness of hand and sharpness of mind required to work with tainted materials without corruption.

| Rank | Forging Pool Bonus | Special |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| Rank 1 | +1d10 | Reduced Corruption risk |
| Rank 2 | +2d10 | Further reduced risk |
| Rank 3 | +3d10 | Can create Masterwork items |

**Debug Enemy** is the diagnostic rite—tracing a complex rune in the air to see the world as the ancestors did: a stream of data. The Rúnasmiðr analyzes the corrupted code of a single foe, searching for vulnerabilities and exploitable bugs.

> *"For a moment, you see the world as the ancestors did: a stream of data. You analyze the corrupted code of your target, searching for vulnerabilities and exploitable bugs."*

| Result | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Success | Reveals target's Resistances and Vulnerabilities |
| Critical Success | Also reveals specific behavioral glitch in target's AI |
| Cost | Small Psychic Stress (direct mental interface) |

**Uruz Imbuement** is the foundational offensive enchantment—carving the Uruz rune (primal strength) onto a weapon, binding a sliver of chaotic Aether into a stable, weaponized form.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Charges | 3 per imbuement |
| Activation | Free action |
| Effect | +2d10 to next damage roll |
| Rank 2 | 4 charges per imbuement |
| Rank 3 | 5 charges, +3d10 damage |

### Tier 2 — Advanced Syntax

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Hagalaz Trap** | Active | 25 AP | Inscribe invisible Ice trap; 2d6 Ice damage (AoE row) when triggered |
| **Thurisaz Trap** | Active | 30 AP | Inscribe invisible Thorn trap; moderate damage + \[Bleeding\] when triggered |
| **Algiz Imbuement** | Crafting | — | Imbue armor with 2 "Warding Rune" charges; activate on hit for +5 Soak |

**Hagalaz Trap** is the first combat control ability—a delayed execution script of imposed order. The Rúnasmiðr quickly inscribes the Hagalaz rune (destructive hail) as an invisible trap.

| Property | Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 3 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Damage | 2d6 Ice | 3d6 Ice | 4d6 Ice |
| Area | Row (AoE) | Row (AoE) | Row (AoE) |
| Duration | 3 turns | 3 turns | 3 turns |
| Special | — | — | Adds \[Chilled\] slow effect |

> *"You inscribe a latent script of hail onto the battlefield. When stepped, a row is battered by ice—the chaotic Aether forced to execute your stable command."*

**Thurisaz Trap** is the single-target debuffing trap—the inscription of the piercing thorn that draws blood and refuses to stop.

**Algiz Imbuement** is the foundational defensive enchantment—writing a stable subroutine of protection directly into the "hardware" of armor.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Charges | 2 per imbuement |
| Activation | Reaction (when hit) |
| Effect | +5 Soak vs that attack |
| Rank 2 | 3 charges per imbuement |
| Rank 3 | 4 charges, +7 Soak |

### Tier 3 — Mastery of the Futhark

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Runic Synergy** | Passive | — | When enemy triggers your trap, remove small amount of Psychic Stress |
| **Rune of Isolation** | Active | 50 AP | Inscribe quarantine trap; \[Root\] for 2 turns + target cannot receive external buffs/healing |

**Runic Synergy** represents perfect harmony with the craft. The act of imposing logical order on the world creates a feedback loop of mental stability, reinforcing the Rúnasmiðr's own sanity.

> *"The successful execution of your code soothes you. Each trap that fires is proof that stable logic still functions in this screaming world."*

**Rune of Isolation** is the masterful inscription of control—a quarantine protocol that severs a target's connection to the outside world, both physically and metaphysically.

| Effect | Duration |
|--------|----------|
| \[Root\] | 2 turns |
| Cannot receive external buffs | 2 turns |
| Cannot receive healing | 2 turns |

### Capstone — Architect of Stability

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Passive** | Can create Masterwork quality items through Runeforging; Critical Success may create artifacts with unique Saga Properties |
| **Active** | 75 AP, once per combat: Create "Sanctuary of Order" zone (3 turns) |

The capstone **Architect of Stability** represents the ultimate expression of the Rúnasmiðr philosophy—the ability to write new, stable source code into the world's broken system.

**Sanctuary of Order:**

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Wild Magic Surges | Negated within zone |
| Random Reality Glitches | Cannot occur within zone |
| Environmental Psychic Stress | Nullified within zone |
| Duration | 3 turns |
| Size | Large zone |

> *"You transcend mere craftsmanship to become a true architect of reality. For three turns, you create a space where the Runic Blight's rules do not apply—a safe space for the party to operate within the heart of the crash."*

This is the ultimate expression of the system debugger's role: creating a zone where stable code overwrites corrupted code entirely.

## Systemic Integration

### Dual-Mode Gameplay

| Mode | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Out-of-Combat (Runeforging)** | Craft enchanted gear at Forge; distribute charged items to party |
| **In-Combat (Runic Traps)** | Place invisible battlefield control; reveal enemy weaknesses |

The Rúnasmiðr is unique in having two complete systems:

**Runeforging (Out-of-Combat):**
1. Must be at a \[Forge\] (settlement crafting station)
2. Requires: Target item + Runic Component + Aether Dust
3. Make Forging Pool check: WITS + WILL + Master Carver bonus
4. On Success: Item gains Runic Charges
5. On Critical Success: Item gains 50% more charges (or Saga Property at Capstone)

**Runic Traps (In-Combat):**
- Invisible until triggered
- Impose zones of coherent reality
- Control enemy movement and positioning
- Anathema to Blighted foes (paradoxical nature)

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Coherent (minimal negative Trauma interactions) |
| **Self-Inflicted Risk** | Low (only Debug Enemy inflicts minor Psychic Stress) |
| **Mitigation** | Runic Synergy removes Stress when traps fire |
| **Strategic Implication** | Sustainable support; can operate indefinitely without spiral |

The Rúnasmiðr proves that **Mystics don't need Corruption**:
- No self-Corruption abilities
- Only Debug Enemy inflicts Psychic Stress (minor)
- Runic Synergy actively removes Stress
- Safe, sustainable magic through precise inscription

This provides a critical alternative to heretical paths like the Rust-Witch or Blót-Priest.

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Warriors / Melee** | Uruz Imbuement (+2d10 damage charges) on their weapons |
| **Tanks** | Algiz Imbuement (+5 Soak charges) on their armor |
| **Controllers** | Trap coordination; your traps enable their follow-up control |
| **Analysts (Jötun-Reader)** | Debug Enemy + their analysis = complete enemy profile |
| **Heretical Builds** | Sanctuary of Order protects them from Wild Magic Surges |

The Rúnasmiðr is the **quintessential force multiplier**—they don't carry the party, they elevate it.

> *"You enchant the Warrior's weapon with Bull's Strength. You ward the tank's armor with Algiz. You place traps to control enemy movement. You debug enemies to reveal weaknesses. Everyone is stronger because you prepared."*

### Positional Considerations

| Position | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **At Forge (Settlement)** | Full Runeforging capability; craft enchanted gear |
| **In Combat** | Trap placement; Debug Enemy; Sanctuary of Order |
| **Protected Position** | Optimal for trap placement and analysis |

The Rúnasmiðr is optimized for **preparation and protected support**—doing the work before combat and controlling the battlefield during it.

## Lore Integration

### Social Function in Aethelgard

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Architects of Hope** | Only source of new, functional, safe runic technology |
| **System Debuggers** | Treat the Runic Blight as a technical problem, not a curse |
| **Smiths of the Word** | Elite order within the Scriptoriums; forge is a library, hammer is a stylus |
| **Firewall Builders** | Create "runic firewalls" that filter the Blight's noise |

The Rúnasmiðr are the most revered, most secretive, and most valuable members of the Jötun-Reader Creed. Their creations are subtle, but they are the **only source of new, functional, and safe runic technology** in the world.

> *"The Warded Blade of a Lex-Guardian that can slightly dampen the Static Sickness, the Amulet of Calm that can quiet the Chorus of the Unfinished, the Filter-Stone that can slowly purify a cup of Blight-tainted water—these are not the world-shattering magics of the past, but they are small, precious miracles in the Age of Echoes."*

### The Vow of the Smith

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Mind of a Scribe** | Linguistic and historical knowledge of a master scholar |
| **Hand of a Dvergr** | Steady hand, patience, obsession with material purity |
| **Purity Above All** | Only the purest crystals from Nidavellir or Pure Steel from Modin's Anvil |
| **The Art of the Patch** | Reverse-engineer the principles of Loki's sabotage; write stable imitations |

A Rúnasmiðr's workshop is not a simple smithy. It is a fusion of laboratory, library, and clean room, located in the most heavily shielded sections of a Scriptorium.

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Jötun-Readers** | Elite core; the scientific and metaphysical engine of the Creed |
| **Dvergr** | Respected peers; different approach (physics vs. programming) but shared precision |
| **Iron-Banes** | Cautious respect; coherent path aligns with their anti-heresy stance |
| **Vanaheim Seiðkona** | Philosophical enemies; Rúnasmiðr see them as self-destructive heretics |
| **General Population** | Revered; their creations are precious miracles |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the old tales, the great Runesmiths carved a word on a sword and made it unbreakable, etched a symbol on a shield and made it turn aside any blow. They speak of it as a great and secret magic. In the Age of Echoes, the Rúnasmiðr know the truth: Runecarving was never magic—it was the highest science. And now that science is broken. The Smiths of the Word are not trying to reclaim the power of the gods. They are engaged in a far more difficult task: debugging the source code of a broken reality. Their forge is a library. Their hammer is a stylus. They write small, stable scripts into screaming chaos, and where they work, order holds. Steel sings with their inscription. Ground bites when stepped. The Sanctuary of Order stands against the Blight's madness. They are the architects of hope in a world that forgot how to build. Measure twice, cut once. Stable scripts over spectacle. Power is what remains when noise is removed."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Rúnasmiðr (Arcane Artisan/System Debugger) represents the Coherent Mystic specialization optimized for force multiplication and battlefield control. Mechanical role: dual-mode support with out-of-combat crafting (Runeforging) and in-combat control (Runic Traps). Key differentiator: enhances entire party through distributed charged gear; no self-Corruption. Core mechanics: Forging Pool (WITS + WILL), Runic Charges (consumable enchantments), Runic Traps (invisible battlefield control). Signature ability: Architect of Stability (Masterwork creation + Sanctuary of Order zone negating Wild Magic Surges and Reality Glitches). Social function: elite Jötun-Reader order—only source of new, functional, safe runic technology. Trauma Economy interaction: Low risk; Debug Enemy costs minor Psychic Stress; Runic Synergy actively removes Stress. Optimal deployment: any party composition; preparation-focused expeditions; extended operations requiring sustainable support."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Rúnasmiðr (Arcane Artisan). ARCHETYPE: Mystic. PATH TYPE: Coherent. ROLE: Force Multiplier / Battlefield Controller. PRIMARY STAT: WITS. SECONDARY STAT: WILL. RESOURCE: Aether Pool (AP) + Stamina. CORE MECHANICS: Runeforging (out-of-combat crafting at Forge), Runic Charges (consumable enchantments), Runic Traps (invisible in-combat control), Forging Pool (WITS + WILL + Master Carver). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Glyphs): Master Carver I, Debug Enemy, Uruz Imbuement. T2 (Advanced Syntax): Hagalaz Trap, Thurisaz Trap, Algiz Imbuement. T3 (Mastery): Runic Synergy, Rune of Isolation. CAPSTONE: Architect of Stability (Passive: Masterwork creation; Active: Sanctuary of Order zone, 75 AP, once per combat, 3 turns, negates Wild Magic/Reality Glitch/Environmental Stress). IMBUEMENTS: Uruz (weapon: 3 charges, +2d10 damage), Algiz (armor: 2 charges, +5 Soak). TRAPS: Hagalaz (Ice AoE), Thurisaz (damage + Bleeding), Isolation (Root + buff/heal prevention). SYNERGIES: All party members (gear enchantment), Controllers (trap coordination), Analysts (enemy profiling)."*

## Summary

The Rúnasmiðr is the **programmer of a broken reality**.

They do not charge into battle seeking glory. They do not embrace corruption seeking power. They work in clean rooms and forges, carefully inscribing stable code into a screaming world. They enchant the party's weapons with Bull's Strength. They ward the party's armor with Algiz. They place traps that impose zones of coherent reality onto chaos.

Their power is force multiplication. They don't make themselves stronger—they make everyone stronger. The Warrior hits harder because of the Rúnasmiðr's inscription. The tank survives because of the Rúnasmiðr's ward. The enemy formation collapses because of the Rúnasmiðr's trap.

This creates a unique niche: the **coherent Mystic** who proves that sustainable, safe magic is possible. While the Rust-Witch embraces entropy and the Blót-Priest pays in blood, the Rúnasmiðr writes stable patches into the world's broken operating system.

But this is not spectacle. This is discipline.

The Rúnasmiðr understands that in the Age of Echoes, the greatest power is not the loudest explosion or the most dramatic sacrifice. The greatest power is **what remains when noise is removed**—small, stable scripts that actually work, inscribed with patience and precision into a world that has forgotten how to function.

*Measure twice, cut once.
Stable scripts over spectacle.
Power is what remains when noise is removed.*
