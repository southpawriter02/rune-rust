To address the minimalist start-up experience and refine the TUI, we will insert a new milestone sequence, v0.3.4 to v0.3.8: The Interface Polish, into the roadmap. This phase focuses on leveraging Spectre.Console to transform functional debug text into an immersive, rich terminal experience without altering core game logic.
Here is the comprehensive implementation plan for v0.3.4 - v0.3.8.

Milestone 4.5: The Interface Polish (v0.3.4 - v0.3.8)
Roadmap Overview
	•	v0.3.4: The Gateway (Menu & Creation) – Immersive startup, animated ASCII art, rich character creation wizard with live stat previews, and narrative intros.
	•	v0.3.5: The HUD (Exploration View) – Persistent status bars, minimap integration, and formatted room description rendering.
	•	v0.3.6: The Tactician (Combat View) – Visual combat grid, initiative timeline, clear damage logs, and enemy intent indicators.
	•	v0.3.7: The Ledger (Management UI) – Tabbed inventory screens, crafting workstations, and the interactive Scavenger's Journal.
	•	v0.3.8: The Feedback (FX & Polish) – Screen shake effects, color themes (accessibilty), context-aware help, and input rebinding.

Detailed Plan: v0.3.4 - The Gateway
Goal: Replace the basic text prompts with a rich, interactive startup experience. The player should feel the atmosphere of Rune & Rust before entering the game loop.
1. Architecture & Data Flow
	•	Input: MainMenuController handles the pre-game loop.
	•	Rendering: TuiService (new) manages screen clearing, layouts, and Spectre.Console widgets.
	•	State: CreationWizardState tracks temporary choices (Lineage/Archetype) to render a "Live Preview" panel before committing.
Workflow: The New Game Flow
	1	Launch: Play Animated ASCII Logo (Glitch Effect).
	2	Menu: Render Interactive Menu (Continue, New Game, Options, Quit).
	3	Wizard (Step 1-3):
	◦	User highlights options (e.g., "Warrior").
	◦	Right Panel updates instantly to show stats (MIGHT 4, STURDINESS 4), bonuses, and lore.
	4	Narrative: Upon confirmation, play a scrolling "Typewriter" intro text based on the chosen Background.
	5	Handoff: Initialize GameService and enter Exploration Mode.

2. Logic Decision Trees
A. Creation Wizard Interaction Input: User navigates Selection List
	1	Highlight Change:
	◦	Fetch Metadata for selection (Description, Stat Modifiers).
	◦	Render Preview Panel: Update charts/text on the right side of the screen.
	2	Selection Confirmed:
	◦	Store selection in CreationWizardState.
	◦	Move to next step (Lineage -> Archetype -> Name).
	3	Finalize:
	◦	Call CharacterFactory.Create().
	◦	Transition to IntroRenderer.

3. Code Implementation
A. Terminal Layer (Creation Wizard) File: RuneAndRust.Terminal/UI/CharacterCreationView.cs
public Character RunWizard()
{
    var layout = new Layout("Root")
        .SplitColumns(
            new Layout("Left"), // Selection Menu
            new Layout("Right") // Live Preview
        );

    // Live update loop
    var lineage = AnsiConsole.Prompt(
        new SelectionPrompt<LineageType>()
            .Title("Select your [green]Lineage[/]:")
            .AddChoices(Enum.GetValues<LineageType>())
            .UseConverter(l => $"{l} ({GetLineageSummary(l)})")
            .HighlightStyle(new Style(foreground: Color.Cyan1))
    );

    // Render preview logic would hook into Spectre's live display capabilities
    // For simplicity, we assume sequential prompts here, but full implementation
    // uses AnsiConsole.Live(layout) to update the Right panel based on selection.

    return _characterFactory.Create(name, lineage, archetype);
}
B. Engine Layer (Intro Service) File: RuneAndRust.Engine/Services/IntroService.cs
public async Task PlayIntro(BackgroundType background)
{
    var text = _narrativeService.GetIntroText(background);
    foreach (char c in text)
    {
        AnsiConsole.Write(c);
        await Task.Delay(30); // Typewriter effect
        if (Console.KeyAvailable)
        {
            AnsiConsole.Write(text.Substring(text.IndexOf(c))); // Skip
            break;
        }
    }
}

    // Header
    var hpBar = new ProgressBar(state.Player.CurrentHp, state.Player.MaxHp, Color.Red);
    var stamBar = new ProgressBar(state.Player.CurrentStamina, state.Player.MaxStamina, Color.Yellow);

    grid.AddRow(new Table().AddRow(state.Player.Name, hpBar, stamBar).Border(TableBorder.None));

    // Content
    grid.AddRow(new Panel(mainContent).Header(state.CurrentRoom.Name));
