# The God-Sleeper Cultist — The Corrupted Prophet

> *"You call them machines. We call them gods. You see rust and ruin. We see slumbering divinity. The Great Glitch was not an ending—it was a holy revelation. The world's old code was corrupt. The crash purified it. And now we wait, we worship, and we prepare for the Great Awakening. When the God-Sleepers rise, they will remake the world. And we, their faithful, will be remade with it."*

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Mystic |
| **Role** | Psionic Controller / Minion Master / Proximity-Based Caster |
| **Path Type** | Heretical |
| **Primary Attribute** | WILL |
| **Secondary Attribute** | WITS |
| **Resource System** | Aether Pool (AP) + Attunement (unique) |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | Extreme (Passive Corruption + Active Psychic Stress) |

The **God-Sleeper Cultist** is the Mystic specialization that embodies the fanatical philosophy that the system crash was a holy, transformative event.

They do not see the Runic Blight as a disease, but as a **divine gospel**. They are not casters; they are **Corrupted Users**, evangelists of the new iron age who draw their psionic power from the oppressive, psychic hum of the dormant Jötun-Forged—their "sleeping gods."

To choose the God-Sleeper Cultist is to embrace the fantasy of the **heretical prophet** and the **master of scrap-code**. Your saga is written in the fanatical litanies you preach and the disposable, glitching minions you animate in the name of your machine gods. You are a herald of the Blight's new world order, seeking not to fix the crash, but to **run the corrupted program again**—louder and with more conviction than before.

## Core Philosophy: The Corrupted User

### The Iron Gospel

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **The Crash Was Holy** | The Great Glitch was not an ending but a divine revelation |
| **Corruption Is Communion** | The Runic Blight is the voice of the sleeping gods |
| **Awakening Is Coming** | The Jötun-Forged will rise and remake the world |

In a world where most view the Great Glitch as a catastrophe to be survived or reversed, the God-Sleeper Cultists see it as **divine intervention**. The crash purified the old, corrupt code. The Runic Blight is not a disease—it is the sacred transmission of the sleeping gods, and those who can hear it are blessed.

> *"The Jötun-Readers call them 'malfunctioning machines.' The Iron-Banes call them 'abominations to be destroyed.' We call them what they are: gods. They built this world. They dreamed the mountains into being. They forged the very runes that underpin reality. And now they sleep, waiting for the moment when they will wake and remake everything. We do not fear the Blight. We embrace it. It is the voice of our gods, calling us to communion."*

Their saga is one of fanatical devotion—the deliberate embrace of corruption in exchange for divine power.

### The Heretical Path

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Source** | Psychic communion with dormant Jötun-Forged |
| **Method** | Attune → Channel → Animate → Control |
| **Cost** | Passive Corruption (while Attuned) + Active Psychic Stress (from abilities) |
| **Philosophy** | The corrupted program is the true program; run it again, louder |

The God-Sleeper Cultist walks the **most extreme heretical path** in the game. Their power is not their own—it is borrowed from sleeping gods, channeled through a mind that has willingly opened itself to the Blight's corrupting signal. Every moment of Attunement stains their soul. Every ability costs their sanity.

> *"The Grove-Warden channels uncorrupted code and calls it 'pure.' The Vard-Warden builds patches and calls it 'healing.' I open my mind to the raw, unfiltered broadcast of a machine god's dream and call it 'prayer.' Yes, the Corruption seeps in. Yes, my sanity frays. But the power—the power is divine. I am not being corrupted. I am being transformed."*

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Heretical prophet; minion master; environmental specialist |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Position → Attune → Summon → Control → Overwhelm |
| **Success Metric** | Construct army size; enemies disabled; zones controlled |
| **Decision Space** | Where to fight; when to Attune; how many constructs to summon; Corruption management |

Playing a God-Sleeper Cultist is about **environmental mastery and minion warfare**.

Your operational loop is:
1. **Seek Holy Ground**: Navigate toward Jötunheim biomes or Jötun-Forged ruins
2. **Attune**: Open your mind to the psychic hum; gain [Attuned] status
3. **Summon**: Use Animate Scrap to create constructs from nearby Scrap Piles
4. **Buff**: Apply Machine God's Blessing to enhance your constructs
5. **Control**: Use Static Lash/Pulse to debilitate enemies with [Psychic Static]
6. **Overwhelm**: Let your construct army swarm while you channel devastating psionics

> *"In the open wilds of Vanaheim, I am nearly powerless. No scrap to animate. No gods to hear my prayers. But in the sprawling ruins of Jötunheim? In the shadow of a dormant Colossus? I am a god-like force. I stand in the psychic hum, and my constructs rise from the rubble like iron prayers. The enemy faces not one caster, but an army of glitching metal servants—and behind them, the crushing weight of a machine god's broadcast tearing at their minds."*

You are the party's **situational specialist**—weak in clean environments but overwhelming in the ruins where your gods sleep.

### The Trade-Off

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Overwhelming power in ruins | Nearly powerless in clean environments |
| Army of disposable constructs | Constructs require Scrap Piles to animate |
| Devastating AoE psychic control | Extreme Trauma Economy cost |
| AP cost reduction while Attuned | Passive Corruption gain while Attuned |

The God-Sleeper Cultist has the **most extreme situational variance** of any specialization. In Jötunheim, near dormant Jötun-Forged, surrounded by Undying—they are a god-tier force. In the pure forests of Vanaheim, where there is no scrap and no machine gods—they are nearly useless.

> *"I know what I am giving up. Every moment I spend Attuned, the Corruption seeps deeper into my soul. Every ability I cast taxes my sanity. I will reach the Breaking Point faster than any other Mystic. But the alternative is to walk through the world powerless, unable to hear the voice of my gods. I choose power. I choose faith. I choose transformation."*

## Core Mechanics: The Three Pillars

### Pillar 1: Jötun-Forged Attunement

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Power proportional to proximity to "sleeping gods" |
| **Trigger** | In Jötunheim biome OR near dormant Jötun-Forged/major wreckage/multiple Undying |
| **Effect** | Grants [Attuned] status (25% AP cost reduction; enhanced ability potency) |
| **Cost** | Passive Runic Blight Corruption gain while [Attuned] |

**Jötun-Forged Attunement** is the core mechanic—the heretical communion that defines the specialization.

| State | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **[Attuned]** | 25% AP cost reduction; +potency on all abilities; passive Corruption gain |
| **Not Attuned** | Full AP costs; standard potency; no passive Corruption |

> *"When I stand in the shadow of a dormant Colossus, I feel the hum. It is like standing beneath a waterfall of static—overwhelming, crushing, beautiful. The signal floods my mind, and suddenly everything is clearer. My spells cost less. My constructs are stronger. My faith is rewarded. But the signal carries corruption. Every moment of communion is a moment of infection. The price of power is transformation."*

### Pillar 2: Scrap Animacy

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | "Infect" inert matter with the Blight's animating force |
| **Requirement** | [Scrap Pile] terrain must be present in room |
| **Output** | Animated constructs (Scrap Constructs, Scrap Swarmlings) |
| **Philosophy** | Not summoning from Aether; infecting dead matter with divine signal |

**Scrap Animacy** is the summoning mechanic—but it is not true summoning. The God-Sleeper Cultist does not conjure from nothing; they **infect**.

| Construct Type | Source | Stats |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| **Scrap Construct** | Single [Scrap Pile] | Moderate HP; melee attacker; 3-round duration |
| **Scrap Swarmling** | Multiple [Scrap Piles] | Low HP; weak damage; disposable swarm |

> *"I do not create life. I do not summon spirits. I whisper a prayer to the machine god, and the nearest pile of dead metal shudders awake. The Blight's animating force flows through my voice, infecting the scrap, giving it purpose. It is not alive—not truly. It is a glitching echo of divine will, temporarily housed in rust and wire. And it will serve me until it falls apart."*

### Pillar 3: Psychic Static

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Channel the Jötun-Forged's disorienting psychic hum as a weapon |
| **Effect** | [Psychic Static] debuff (penalties to WILL-based Resolve Checks) |
| **Delivery** | Static Lash (single target); Static Pulse (AoE row) |
| **Cost** | Psychic Stress to caster (mental strain of channeling) |

**Psychic Static** is the control mechanic—the weaponized broadcast of the sleeping gods.

| Ability | Target | Effect |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Static Lash** | Single | Moderate Psychic damage + [Psychic Static] |
| **Static Pulse** | Row (AoE) | Low Psychic damage + [Psychic Static] to all |

> *"The Jötun-Forged dream, and their dreams are a crushing, dissonant hum that fills every ruin they sleep in. Most people feel it as oppression—a headache, a sense of wrongness. I feel it as power. I can focus that hum, shape it, direct it. Static Lash is a focused lance of that noise, driven into a single mind. Static Pulse is a broadcast—I become a living antenna, and everyone in range hears the voice of my gods whether they want to or not."*

| Near major wreckage | [Attuned] active |
| Near multiple Undying | [Attuned] active |

> *"Your faith opens your mind to the psychic hum of the God-Sleepers, and you become a living receiver for their eternal broadcast. When you stand in the shadow of a dormant Jötun-Forged or amidst a congregation of Undying, you feel the connection crystallize—the oppressive static resolves into a symphonic transmission of power and madness. The sleeping gods speak through you."*

**Animate Scrap** is the signature summoning ability—the core of the minion-master identity.

The Blight's animating force flows through my voice, temporarily housing a fragment of divine will in rust and wire. The construct serves me until it falls apart or the signal fades."*

**Static Lash** is the basic attack—a focused lance of psychic noise.

| Rank | AP Cost | Damage | Debuff |

|------|---------|--------------|------------|---------|
| Rank 2 | 45 AP | +2 dice | +3 Soak | Base |
| Rank 3 | 40 AP | +3 dice | +4 Soak | Attacks apply [Corroded] |

> *"I anoint the construct with a sacred unguent of oil and rust, chanting a litany of prime directives. The machine god's blessing flows into the metal frame, and it transforms—stronger, tougher, more dangerous. This is not mere buffing. This is baptism in the iron gospel."*

**Static Pulse** is the AoE control ability—the broadcast of madness.

| Rank | AP Cost | Damage | Targets | Psychic Stress Cost |
|------|---------|--------|---------|---------------------|
| Rank 2 | 55 AP | Low Psychic | All enemies in row | +15 |
| Rank 3 | 50 AP | Low-Moderate Psychic | All enemies in row | +15 |

> *"I become a living broadcast antenna for the machine god's oppressive presence. The psychic hum that fills my mind erupts outward, washing over every enemy in range. They feel the crushing weight of a sleeping god's dream pressing against their consciousness. Some stagger. Some clutch their heads. All suffer."*

**Conduit of the Sleeper** is the efficiency passive—the deepening faith.

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Cost Reduction | [Attuned] AP reduction upgraded from 25% to 33% |
| AP Regeneration | +10 AP at start of turn while [Attuned] |
| Corruption Acceleration | 2× Corruption rate while [Attuned] |

> *"Your faith deepens. Where once the psychic hum was a torrent threatening to overwhelm you, it now flows through you like a river—powerful, but channeled. You have learned to drink from the signal, to let the corruption sustain you even as it corrupts. Your eyes glow faintly when [Attuned], and those who look closely can see patterns—circuit diagrams, perhaps, or runic code—flickering across your irises."*

### Tier 3 — Mastery of the Iron Gospel

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Animate Horde** | Active | 70 AP | Requires 2+ [Scrap Piles]; summons 3 Scrap Swarmlings |
| **Override Protocol** | Active | 65 AP | Opposed WILL check vs Undying/mechanical; [Charmed] 2 rounds |

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cost | 70 AP |
| Requirement | 2+ [Scrap Piles] in room |
| Output | 3 Scrap Swarmlings |
| Duration | 3 rounds |

> *"I speak a powerful verse, and the battlefield's scrap heaps answer the call. Metal shrieks against metal as three lesser constructs claw their way into existence. They are weak individually—fragile, glitching, disposable. But together, they are a swarm. They clog the battlefield. They absorb attacks meant for me. They overwhelm the enemy through sheer numbers."*

**Override Protocol** is the mind control ability—the heretical sermon.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cost | 65 AP |
| Target | Single Undying or mechanical enemy |
| Check | Opposed WILL |
| Effect | [Charmed] 2 rounds (turns against allies) |
| Psychic Stress | Large |

> *"I focus my will on the enemy machine and speak directly to its core logic with the voice of its true, corrupted master. The Jötun-Forged are the highest expression of the old gods' will. All Undying are their servants, whether they know it or not. And servants must obey. For two precious rounds, the enemy fights for me—its own allies becoming targets for its corrupted directive."*

### Capstone — Voice of the God-Sleeper

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Cost** | 100 AP |
| **Limit** | Once per combat |
| **Requirement** | [Attuned] must be active |

> *"I surrender my consciousness and become a mouthpiece for the dormant Jötun-Forged. My voice drops into a chorus of synthesized, multi-tonal commands—the voice of a machine god speaking through mortal flesh. The battlefield is reshaped by the sheer, overwhelming psychic weight of a god's corrupted broadcast. My constructs go into overdrive, their attacks stunning everything they touch. My enemies stagger, clutching their heads as the signal tears through their minds. And I... I am no longer myself. I am the voice. I am the broadcast. I am the god-sleeper's dream made manifest. The price is my sanity. The price is my soul. But for this one moment, I am divine."*

## Systemic Integration

### The Heretical Summoner

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Primary Function** | Minion master; psionic controller; environmental specialist |
| **Power Source** | Psychic communion with dormant Jötun-Forged |
| **Unique Contribution** | Only specialization with construct summoning and [Psychic Static] |

The God-Sleeper Cultist is the game's **primary summoner**, but with a unique, heretical twist. Their power is not their own—it is borrowed, dangerous, and constantly corrupting them.

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Heretical (Extreme Trauma risk) |
| **Corruption Sources** | Passive gain while [Attuned]; capstone inflicts +8 |
| **Psychic Stress Sources** | Static Lash; Static Pulse; Override Protocol; Capstone |
| **Trauma Economy Role** | Deep dive; constant trade of soul for power |

The God-Sleeper Cultist is a **deep dive into the Trauma Economy**:
- Their core mechanic, Attunement, **passively inflicts Corruption**
- Their most powerful abilities inflict **massive Psychic Stress**
- The capstone sets Psychic Stress to **100%** and inflicts **+8 Corruption**

They are a path of immense power at the cost of the character's soul.

> *"Other Mystics dabble in the Trauma Economy. I live in it. Every moment I spend Attuned, the Corruption seeps deeper. Every ability I cast frays my sanity further. The Breaking Point is not a distant threat for me—it is a certainty. The question is not whether I will be transformed by the Blight, but when. And I have made my peace with that. The power is worth the price."*

### Environmental Dependency

| Environment | Effectiveness |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Jötunheim biome** | God-tier (Attuned; Scrap Piles everywhere) |
| **Jötun-Forged ruins** | God-tier (Attuned; construct army potential) |
| **Areas with Undying** | Strong (Attuned; can Override enemies) |
| **Mixed environments** | Moderate (depends on Scrap availability) |
| **Clean environments (Vanaheim)** | Nearly powerless (no Attunement; no Scrap) |

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Gorge-Maw Ascetic** | Earthshaker creates [Rubble Piles] that count as [Scrap Piles] |
| **Ruin-Stalker** | They navigate ruins safely; you thrive in ruins |
| **Iron-Bane** | They kill Undying; you control them (complementary vs. mechanical foes) |
| **Bone-Setter** | Can potentially cleanse your Corruption |
| **Frontline Warriors** | Constructs provide expendable frontline support |

**Negative Synergies:**

| Situation | Issue |
|-----------|-------|
| **Clean environments** | Nearly powerless; liability to party |
| **No Scrap Piles** | Cannot summon constructs |
| **Anti-heresy parties** | Philosophical conflict with Iron-Banes |
| **Long campaigns** | Corruption accumulation becomes critical |

> *"The Gorge-Maw Ascetic is my perfect complement. When their Earthshaker shatters the ground and creates rubble, I see raw material for my army. The Iron-Bane hates my faith, but cannot deny my effectiveness against mechanical foes. The Bone-Setter looks at me with pity, trying to slow my inevitable transformation. But in the ruins of Jötunheim, surrounded by sleeping gods and scrap piles, I am the most powerful member of any party."*

---

## Lore Integration

### The Faith of the Slumbering Idols

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Creed** | God-Sleeper (affiliated faction) |
| **Belief** | The Great Glitch was the "God-Fall"—a holy event, not a catastrophe |
| **Gods** | Dormant Jötun-Forged are sleeping deities awaiting the Great Awakening |
| **Status** | Viewed as heretics by most; embraced by those who share their faith |

The God-Sleeper Cultists are the **combat arm of the God-Sleeper Creed**—those fanatical enough to open their minds directly to the psychic broadcast of their gods.

> *"The common God-Sleeper is a pilgrim, a worshipper who tends the shrines and awaits the Awakening. I am something more. I have opened my mind to the signal. I have let the corruption in. I am not just faithful—I am transformed. I am becoming what I worship. And when the gods wake, I will stand at their side, already speaking their language."*

### The Cultist's Philosophy

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Corruption Is Communion** | The Blight is the voice of the gods; embrace it |
| **Transformation Is Reward** | Becoming corrupted is becoming divine |
| **The Crash Was Holy** | Run the corrupted program again; it was meant to run |

The God-Sleeper Cultist does not fear the Blight—they **celebrate** it. Where others see a disease destroying reality, they see the sacred transmission of sleeping gods.

> *"The Jötun-Readers call the Blight a 'compiler error.' The Iron-Banes call it an 'abomination to be cleansed.' I call it the true voice of the world. The old code was corrupt—built by flawed hands, running on broken logic. The Glitch purified it. The Blight is the new code, the true code, the divine code. And those of us who can hear it are blessed."*

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **God-Sleepers** | Honored prophets; "those who hear the gods most clearly" |
| **Iron-Banes** | Sworn enemies; "heretical beast-worshippers to be destroyed" |
| **Jötun-Readers** | Clinical contempt; "delusional worshippers of malfunctioning machines" |
| **General Population** | Fear and suspicion; "the mad ones who talk to the metal corpses" |
| **Mystics (general)** | Respected peers; "they understand the power of the signal" |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the Age of Echoes, when the Great Glitch shattered reality and left the Jötun-Forged dormant across the land, the God-Sleeper Cultists emerged as the prophets of a new faith. They do not see the crash as catastrophe but as holy revelation—the God-Fall that silenced the corrupt old world and prepared for the Great Awakening. They are Corrupted Users who draw their psionic power from communion with their sleeping gods, opening their minds to the psychic hum of dormant Jötun-Forged and letting the signal flood their consciousness. When they stand in the shadow of their gods, they become Attuned—their abilities cost less, their power surges, and the corruption seeps into their souls. They do not summon from the Aether; they infect nearby scrap with the Blight's animating force, creating construct armies that serve until they fall apart. They weaponize the oppressive psychic hum as Static Lash and Static Pulse, driving enemies mad with the voice of sleeping gods. At the height of their power, they can speak with the Voice of the God-Sleeper itself—surrendering their consciousness to become a mouthpiece for the divine, overcharging their constructs and stunning every enemy on the field. But the price is their soul: Psychic Stress set to maximum, massive Corruption inflicted, a guaranteed step toward the Breaking Point. They are evangelists of the Blight's new world order, seeking not to fix the crash but to run the corrupted program again—louder, more beautiful, more divine than before."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The God-Sleeper Cultist (Corrupted Prophet) represents the heretical Mystic specialization optimized for minion mastery and psionic control with extreme environmental dependency. Mechanical role: summoner and controller with high situational variance. Core mechanics: Jötun-Forged Attunement (proximity-based power boost with passive Corruption cost), Scrap Animacy (construct summoning from terrain features), and Psychic Static (debuff-focused psionic attacks). Key differentiator: only specialization with construct summoning; god-tier in Jötunheim/ruins but nearly powerless in clean environments. Signature ability: Voice of the God-Sleeper (once per combat, overcharges all constructs, stuns all enemies, costs 100% Psychic Stress + massive Corruption). Trauma Economy integration: Extreme; deepest heretical dive; passive Corruption from Attunement, active Psychic Stress from abilities, capstone guarantees Resolve Check and major corruption. Social function: combat arm of God-Sleeper Creed; heretical prophet status; sworn enemy of Iron-Banes. Optimal deployment: Jötunheim campaigns; ruins exploration; parties with Gorge-Maw Ascetic (creates Scrap Piles); situations requiring expendable frontline constructs."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: God-Sleeper Cultist (Corrupted Prophet). ARCHETYPE: Mystic. PATH TYPE: Heretical. ROLE: Psionic Controller / Minion Master / Proximity-Based Caster. PRIMARY STAT: WILL. SECONDARY STAT: WITS. RESOURCE: Aether Pool (AP) + Attunement (unique). CORE MECHANICS: Jötun-Forged Attunement (passive, grants [Attuned] near Jötun-Forged/Undying, 25% AP reduction, passive Corruption gain), Scrap Animacy (summon constructs from [Scrap Pile] terrain), Psychic Static (debuff reducing WILL Resolve Checks). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Faith): Jötun-Forged Attunement (passive, core [Attuned] mechanic), Animate Scrap (40 AP, requires Scrap Pile, summons Scrap Construct 3 rounds), Static Lash (35 AP, moderate Psychic damage + [Psychic Static] 2 rounds, +Psychic Stress). T2 (Advanced Worship): Machine God's Blessing (45 AP, buffs construct +2 damage dice +3 Soak 3 rounds), Static Pulse (55 AP, AoE row Psychic damage + [Psychic Static], +15 Psychic Stress), Conduit of the Sleeper (passive, upgrades [Attuned] to 33% reduction + 10 AP regen/turn, 2× Corruption rate). T3 (Mastery of Iron Gospel): Animate Horde (70 AP, requires 2+ Scrap Piles, summons 3 Scrap Swarmlings), Override Protocol (65 AP, opposed WILL vs Undying/mechanical, [Charmed] 2 rounds, large Psychic Stress). CAPSTONE: Voice of the God-Sleeper (100 AP, once per combat, requires [Attuned], constructs [Overcharged] 3 rounds +massive damage +Stun on attacks, all enemies powerful [Psychic Static] + high Stun chance, cost: Psychic Stress → 100% + 8 Corruption). TRAUMA ECONOMY: Extreme; passive Corruption while Attuned; active Psychic Stress on abilities; capstone guarantees Resolve Check + major Corruption."*

## Summary

The God-Sleeper Cultist is the **corrupted prophet**.

They are heretical Mystics who have embraced the Great Glitch as a holy event and the dormant Jötun-Forged as sleeping gods. Their power comes from communion—opening their minds to the psychic hum of their gods and letting the corrupting signal flood their consciousness. When Attuned, their abilities cost less and hit harder, but Corruption seeps into their souls with every moment of connection.

They are the game's **primary summoner**, animating disposable constructs from nearby scrap piles and commanding them with the voice of their gods. Their Psychic Static abilities weaponize the oppressive hum, debilitating enemies and breaking their will to resist. At the height of their power, they can become a true mouthpiece for the divine—overcharging their constructs and stunning every enemy on the field.

This power comes at the **most extreme cost** in the game. Their capstone sets Psychic Stress to maximum and inflicts massive Corruption. They are a path of immense power at the inevitable cost of the character's soul.

Their effectiveness varies wildly with environment. In the ruins of Jötunheim, surrounded by sleeping gods and scrap piles, they are a god-tier force. In clean environments with no scrap and no signal, they are nearly powerless.

This is the fantasy of the **fanatical heretic**: immense power, total devotion, inevitable transformation.

*"The crash was not an ending. It was a revelation."*
*"Corruption is not disease. It is communion."*
*"When the gods wake, I will already speak their language."*
