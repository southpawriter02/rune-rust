## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Navigational Bypass is the Jötun-Reader's **primary hazard-mitigation tool**—the triumph of intellect over environmental danger. They don't disarm traps; they find the flaw in their design and calculate the path of least resistance.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Grant party-wide [Bypass] buff
- **Secondary:** Next triggered trap is completely negated
- **Single Use:** Consumed on first trap trigger
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The scholar who reads blueprints in their mind's eye

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High (complete trap negation)
- **Single Use:** Only protects against ONE trap
- **Out of Combat:** Preparatory, not reactive
- **Duration:** Lasts until consumed or Rest

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Jötun-Reader pauses at the threshold, eyes scanning the architecture. In their mind, faded schematics overlay the physical space—pre-crash safety protocols, engineering tolerances, failure points.

*"The pressure plates are here, here, and here. Step exactly where I step. The dart launchers have a 0.3 second delay after activation—we'll be past the kill zone before they fire."*

They do not disarm the trap. They **transcend** it.

### Thematic Resonance

Navigational Bypass establishes the Jötun-Reader as the party's intellectual guide—proof that the safest path is the one calculated by the smartest mind.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Activation

- **Action Type:** Standard Action (Out of Combat)
- **Cost:** 30 Stamina
- **Target:** Entire party
- **Restriction:** Cannot be used in combat

### [Bypass] Buff

| Effect | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Protection | Next triggered trap is completely negated |
| Duration | Until consumed OR until Rest |
| Scope | Protects ALL party members |
| Consumption | Removed from all party members when triggered |

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Context Check:** Confirm party is not in combat
2. **Cost Payment:** Spend 30 Stamina
3. **Buff Application:** Apply [Bypass] to all party members
4. **Trap Trigger:** When trap would activate, [Bypass] negates it
5. **Consumption:** Remove [Bypass] from all party members

---

## IV. Progression Path

### Rank 1 (Base — This Ability)

- [Bypass]: Negate next trap (single use)
- Cost: 30 Stamina

### Rank 2 (Expert — 20 PP)

- [Bypass]: Negate next trap
- Cost: 20 Stamina
- **New:** Also reveals trap type before negation

### Rank 3 (Mastery — Capstone)

- [Bypass]: Negate next TWO traps
- Cost: 20 Stamina
- Reveals trap types
- **New:** Party gains +2 dice to Perception checks for trap detection while [Bypass] active

---

## V. Tactical Applications

1. **Trap-Heavy Ruins:** Essential for dangerous exploration
2. **Unknown Territory:** Insurance against hidden dangers
3. **Resource Conservation:** Avoid damage/healing costs
4. **Time Efficiency:** No need to carefully search every tile
5. **Party Safety:** Protects fragile party members

---

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Structural Insight:** Know what traps exist to prepare for
- **Ruin-Stalker:** Different approach—avoid vs disarm
- **Exploration campaigns:** Maximum value in trap-heavy content
- **Low-Perception parties:** Compensation for trap detection weakness

### Negative Synergies

- **Combat focus:** No combat application
- **Trap-light content:** Less valuable in safe areas
- **Multiple traps:** Only protects against first (at base rank)
