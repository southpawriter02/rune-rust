### **I. Core Philosophy: The Purge of the Corrupted Code**

The **Iron-Bane** is the Warrior specialization that embodies the philosophy of the **fanatical, righteous purge**. They are scholar-slayers, a grim order dedicated to the utter extermination of the **Undying**. Theirs is a crusade fueled by loss and honed by encyclopedic knowledge of their hated foe.

To choose the Iron-Bane is to embrace the fantasy of the ultimate monster hunter and the holy inquisitor. Every battle is a righteous act of purification.

### **II. Player-Facing Presentation**

- **Role:** Specialist Hunter, Anti-Armor Tank, Psychic Sentinel
- **Primary Attribute:** MIGHT (for shattering steel)
- **Secondary Attribute:** WILL (for resisting psychic hum of foes)
- **Gameplay Feel:** Highly specialized "hard counter" class. Methodical loop of identifying prey, stripping defenses with corrosive assaults, and executing with overwhelming force.

### **III. Mechanical Implementation: The Art of the Hunt**

**A. Core Mechanic: Vengeance (Unique Resource)**

- Resource bar from 0 to 100
- **Generation:** Hitting Undying/mechanical enemies + resisting psychic/fear effects
- **Spending:** Required for anti-machine abilities
- **Decay:** Lost on Sanctuary Rest

**B. Core Mechanic: Specialist Knowledge**
