# The Midgard Combine — The Heartland Alliance

> *"The stone does not forget, the stone does not lie."*
> — Midgard Combine proverb

---

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Classification** | Decentralized Agricultural Confederation |
| **Common Names** | The Heartland, The Breadbasket, The Combine |
| **Core Philosophy** | Pragmatic Cooperation; Agricultural Priority; Hold Autonomy |
| **Primary Territory** | Midgard Deck (Central Habitation Tier 1); ~500,000 sq km |
| **Leadership Structure** | Council of Jarls and Guild Masters (seasonal assembly) |
| **Relationship to Blight** | Defensive containment; "The Wall separates order from chaos" |

The Skalds of other factions often dismiss the people of Midgard. The Iron-Banes call them soft, the God-Sleepers call them faithless, and the Jötun-Readers call them ignorant.

But the Dvergr traders have a different, more pragmatic name for them.

They call them the Heartland.

The Midgard Combine is not a kingdom of zealots or a monastery of scribes. It is something far rarer and perhaps more resilient: a civilization built on the simple, unshakable foundation of the common harvest and the common good.

It is the closest thing the Age of Echoes has to a future.

## Core Identity: The Law of the Hold

### The Foundational Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Hold Autonomy** | Each Jarl maintains absolute authority within their walls—local laws, resource allocation, dispute resolution |
| **Pragmatic Cooperation** | Alliances formed through demonstrated mutual benefit rather than ideological alignment |
| **Agricultural Priority** | Food production recognized as existential foundation—all other activities depend on harvest success |
| **Witnessed Contracts** | Trust established through public agreements with neutral third-party verification |
| **Defensive Realism** | Survival requires constant vigilance—the Wall separates fragile order from absolute chaos |
| **Seasonal Coordination** | Natural agricultural cycles dictate social rhythms |

The Combine achieves coordination not through centralized authority but through overlapping trade networks, witnessed contracts, and seasonal assemblies that preserve local autonomy while enabling collective action.

> *"The Wall is the soul of the Hold."*
> — Combine saying

### What the Combine Values

| Other Factions Value | The Combine Values |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| "Divine truth" | A full granary |
| "Technological mastery" | A sharp spear and strong walls |
| "Ancient knowledge" | The wisdom of the harvest |
| "Ideological purity" | A witnessed contract, honestly kept |

---

## Origins: The Alliance of the Furrow

### The Post-Glitch Foundation

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| **Age of Wandering (122-287 PG)** | First permanent agricultural Holds established |
| **Year 182 PG** | Cartographers' Compact founding Rangers Guild |
| **Age of Walls (287-518 PG)** | Hold fortification, Jarl authority formalization |
| **Peak Prosperity (351-450 PG)** | 64-82 caravans/year on major routes |
| **Age of Creeds (518-783 PG)** | Factional pressure, infrastructure challenges |

The Midgard Combine was not forged in a great war or founded by a visionary king. It grew, slowly and organically, from the soil itself. In the chaos following the Glitch, the survivors of the Midgard Deck turned to the one truth that had outlasted the gods and their machines: the land.

### The First Holds

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Foundation** | Walled farming communities built around decontaminating Blight-touched soil |
| **Purpose** | Raising first herds of post-Glitch livestock, cultivating hardy crops |
| **Architecture** | Defensive walls, watch-towers, communal Great Halls |
| **Governance** | Each Hold led by a Jarl; absolute authority within walls |

### The Trade Routes and Mutual Defense

| Development | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| **Agricultural Surplus** | First true food surpluses since the Glitch |
| **Trade Necessity** | Caravans of grain and salted meat between Holds |
| **Security Needs** | Mutual defense pacts against Ash-Vargr and raiders |
| **Formalization** | Rangers Guild established (182 PG) for route security |

### The Founding Charter

The network of treaties and alliances was eventually formalized with the signing of the Combine Charter at the central trade hub of Crossroads. The Midgard Combine was born not as an empire, but as a pragmatic, necessary alliance for security and commerce.

## Society and Structure: The Council of Equals

### Political Classification

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Organization Type** | Decentralized confederation of autonomous Holds |
| **Territory** | 200-300 Holds across ~500,000 square kilometers |
| **Population** | 150,000-200,000 (rough estimate; no centralized census) |
| **Capital** | Crossroads (de facto economic center, no formal capital status) |
| **Governance** | Council of Jarls and Guild Masters (seasonal assembly) |

### Hold-Level Administration

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **The Jarl** | Absolute authority within Hold walls; judge, military commander, resource allocator |
| **Council of Elders** | Advisory body; agricultural expertise and historical memory |
| **Master Builder** | Construction and infrastructure oversight |
| **Materials Quartermaster** | Salvage and resource procurement |
| **Feast Warden** | Communal provisioning coordination |
| **Watch Captain** | Security and guard rotation |
| **Bell-Keeper** | Timekeeping and signals |
| **Field Master** | Agricultural coordination |
| **Harvest Captain** | Intensive harvest period management |

### The Council of Jarls and Guild Masters

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Meeting Schedule** | Seasonal assembly at Crossroads |
| **Composition** | Jarls from powerful Holds + Guild Masters (Rangers, Smiths, Merchants) |
| **Decision-Making** | Negotiation and mutual interest (not majority vote) |
| **Authority Scope** | Inter-Hold trade and common defense only |
| **Limitation** | "Calling of banners" not commanding obedience—participation voluntary |

There is no single king. Power is a constant, shifting balance of negotiation and mutual interest. Outside of the trade routes and Crossroads, each Jarl is the absolute ruler of their own Hold.

### Legal Systems

| Level | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **Hold-Level** | Jarl as final arbiter; public judgment ceremonies; swift punishment |
| **Inter-Hold** | Rangers Guild witness testimony; Skald memory protocols; Grey Blades arbitration |
| **Contract Enforcement** | Spit-Pact social enforcement; witnessed deals; economic exile for oath-breakers |

Capital crimes in Holds reflect survival priorities:
- **Theft of food:** Capital crime
- **Wall dereliction:** Treason
- **Murder:** Blood-debt to victim's clan
- **Oath-breaking:** Social death (permanent ostracism)

## Territory and Population

### Core Territories

| Region | Description | Population Share |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Central Combine Lowlands** | Primary agricultural belt; 170-180 day frost-free season; fertile Good Earth and rehabilitated Ash-Fall Earth | 60-70% |
| **River Hold Networks** | Waterway territories; flood-resistant architecture; critical trade route nodes | 15-20% |
| **Ridge Hold Chains** | Defensive high ground; watch-tower relay beacons; mountain pass control | 10-15% |
| **Greatwood Estate Holds** | Forested agricultural complexes; timber production; Ash-Vargr threat zones | 10-15% |

### Hold Architecture

| Feature | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Defensive Walls** | 3-5 meters height; salvaged ferrocrete and Pure Steel frames |
| **Watch-Towers** | At corners and gates; 2-person rotating guards; 4-hour shifts |
| **Memory-Stones** | Monuments at entrances with carved names of deceased |
| **Great Halls** | Central hearth; communal living; 50-100 residents per hall |
| **Kill-Zones** | 50-100m cleared ground beyond walls |
| **Gate Houses** | Double-door systems with murder-holes |

### Major Settlement Types

| Type | Characteristics |
|------|-----------------|
| **River Holds** | Ferry-dependent; flood-resistant elevated construction |
| **Ridge Holds** | Built into cliff faces; watch-fire relay chains |
| **Market Towns** | Rotating crown system; Rope Court governance |
| **Crossroads** | Trade capital; tariff ladder hub; Grey Blades arbitration |

---

## Economic Foundations: The Breadbasket

### Agricultural Base

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Primary Grain** | Grit-Corn (90-120 day growing cycle) |
| **Secondary Crop** | Scrab-Root (tolerates worse soil; lower calories) |
| **Good Earth Yield** | 8-12 tons per hectare |
| **Ash-Fall Earth Yield** | 3-5 tons per hectare |
| **Communal Field Size** | 20-50 hectares per extended family group (15-30 adults) |
| **Surface-Realm Grain Share** | 60-70% of total supply |

The Combine is the "breadbasket" of the Age of Echoes. Its farms and ranches produce the vast majority of the world's reliable food supply—a resource that gives them quiet, undeniable power over more militant and specialized factions.

### Preservation Infrastructure

| Method | Shelf Life | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **Salting** | 6 months | 1:10 salt-to-meat ratio |
| **Smoking** | 8-10 months | Willow-wood preferred; 3-5 days for large game |
| **Dvergr Cold-Vaults** | 12+ months | 5 Cogs per cubic meter per month |
| **Alchemical Draught** | Multi-year | 25-50 Cogs per kilogram; rare |
| **Baseline Storage Loss** | 10-15% annually | Rises to 20-30% in harsh conditions |

### The Dvergr Cog Economy

| Equivalence | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| **1 Cog** | 1 week unskilled labor |
| **1 Cog** | 10 meals |
| **1 Cog** | 1 night shelter |
| **1 Cog** | 2 liters Dvergr ale |
| **1 Cog** | 0.5 kg Dvergr-steel |

The Dvergr Clockwork Cog functions as universal trade standard—the sole widely-accepted currency in post-Glitch Aethelgard. Pure Steel tokens (15 grams, 2.5cm diameter) with anti-counterfeiting Guild marks.

### Trade Networks

| Route Class | Speed | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| **A-Class** | 25-35 km/day | Combine Toll Roads; courier seals honored |
| **B-Class** | 18-25 km/day | Long Roads; waystone navigation |
| **C-Class** | 10-18 km/day | Local tracks; ferry crossings |
| **D-Class** | 3-10 km/day | Expedition paths; Scar marches |

### Rangers Guild Escort Rates

| Corridor | Rate per wagon per 100 km |
|----------|---------------------------|
| **A-Class** | 1 Cog |
| **B-Class** | 2 Cogs |
| **C-Class** | 4 Cogs |
| **D-Class** | 10+ Cogs (negotiated) |

---

## Military Capabilities: Distributed Defense

### Hold-Level Defense

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Primary Defense** | The Wall (3-5m height, ferrocrete and Pure Steel) |
| **Guard Force** | All able adults trained in basic defense |
| **Watch Rotation** | 4-hour shifts; 2-person positions |
| **Response Time** | Immediate within walls; militia mobilization within hours |

### Inter-Hold Coordination

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Calling of Banners** | Voluntary response system; Jarls retain local command |
| **Mutual Defense Pacts** | Between allied Holds; informal treaties |
| **Rangers Intelligence** | Threat reports, hazard warnings, route updates |
| **Coordination Challenges** | Slow mobilization; conflicting priorities; reluctance to leave Hold |

### Military Limitations

| Vulnerability | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **No Standing Army** | Militias disband after crisis |
| **Limited Coordination** | Each Jarl independent; no unified command |
| **Technology Gap** | Inadequate against organized factional forces |
| **Intelligence Dependency** | Relies on Rangers Guild for reconnaissance |
| **Strategic Model** | Depth through dispersion, not concentrated power |

> The Combine survives not through overwhelming power but through being too distributed to destroy, too pragmatic to fragment completely, and too economically essential for other factions to ignore.

### Threat Environment

| Threat | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ash-Vargr Packs** | 5-20 individuals; coordinated hunting; 150% encounter increase |
| **Bandit Raids** | Rust-Clan opportunists; organized criminal networks |
| **Iron-Banes Burn Raids** | Purges into Combine territory destroying "tainted ruins" |
| **God-Sleeper Pilgrimages** | Security concerns from mass movements |
| **Environmental Hazards** | Blight manifestations; Red-Sun haze; infrastructure degradation |

---

## Cultural Identity: The Hearth and the Hold

### Core Values

| Value | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| **Pragmatic Survival** | Over ideological purity |
| **Communal Labor** | Extended family field groups; barn-raising cooperation |
| **Witnessed Trust** | Spit-Pact curses; contract enforcement through social pressure |
| **Agricultural Competence** | Elder farmer authority; harvest as validation |
| **Defensive Vigilance** | Wall reverence; constant threat awareness |

### Unifying Practices

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Ghost's Share** | First portion of every meal set aside "for those lost to the wastes" |
| **Harvest-Moot** | Annual inter-Hold gathering; Games, feasts, Council sessions |
| **Coming-of-Age Trials** | Spear-Trial (martial) and Seed-Trial (craft/agriculture) |
| **Memory-Stone Rites** | 3-day mourning; deed inscription; communal remembrance |
| **Spit-Pact** | Witnessed oral contracts; curse invoked for breach |

### Ghost's Share Ritual

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Timing** | Before any meal; first portion set aside |
| **Placement** | On ground beside eater OR dedicated Ghost's Bowl |
| **Consumption** | Never by observer; discretely cleared by poor |
| **Refusal Consequence** | Severe social stigma; marks selfishness |
| **Function** | Remembrance + subtle wealth redistribution |

### The Skaldic Tradition

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Oral History** | Living libraries; saga performance; year-naming |
| **Entertainment** | Winter evening gatherings; storytelling |
| **Knowledge Transmission** | Agricultural wisdom encoded in narratives |
| **Year-Naming** | Chronicler's Council assigns memorable titles to each year |

The Jötun-Readers observe that the Skalds function as "living databases, albeit with significant data corruption"—factually imprecise but emotionally true, allegory obscuring technical specifications.

## Factional Relations

### Rangers Guild: Symbiotic Infrastructure

| Guild View | Combine View |
|------------|--------------|
| "We live between the Holds—on the roads, watching the Green Path." | "The Rangers keep the roads open. Without them, we starve." |
| "Midgard's strength isn't any single settlement but the network connecting them." | "Neutral service, fair prices, witnessed contracts." |

The Rangers Guild operates as Combine infrastructure—trade route security, way-station networks, contract arbitration. Their neutral stance preserves Hold autonomy.

### Dvergr Clans: Critical Economic Partner

| Dvergr View | Combine View |
|-------------|--------------|
| "Surface-dwellers lack systematic rigor but demonstrate admirable resource optimization." | "Dvergr precision and Dvergr steel. We need both." |
| "The Cog economy we introduced provides stable valuation framework." | "Their cold-vaults keep our harvests safe through winter." |

The Combine as breadbasket, the Dvergr as technology provider. Mutual dependency creates stable partnership despite cultural differences.

### Iron-Banes Crusade: Ideological Tension

| Iron-Bane View | Combine View |
|----------------|--------------|
| "The Midgarders grow soft with their markets and comfort." | "Fanatics who burn useful salvage and call it holy." |
| "Every meal should be earned with prayer and labor." | "Their purity doesn't grow Grit-Corn." |
| "They will need our discipline when the final purge comes." | "Border Quench Pacts keep the peace. Barely." |

Theological pressure to reject salvaged technology conflicts with Combine pragmatism. Burn raids disrupt territories. Recruitment from dispossessed farmers threatens population.

### God-Sleeper Cults: Competitive Influence

| God-Sleeper View | Combine View |
|------------------|--------------|
| "The common folk deserve the comfort of faith." | "Simple message, simple hope. Appeals to farmers." |
| "When the gods awaken, all will be restored." | "Shrines on our outskirts, pilgrims on our roads." |

Pilgrimage routes through Combine territories. Shrine construction on settlement outskirts. Economic benefit from traffic offsets security concerns.

### Jötun-Readers: Knowledge Exchange

| Jötun-Reader View | Combine View |
|-------------------|--------------|
| "The Combine represents humanity's most successful post-Glitch adaptation." | "Scholars who pay fair prices for food." |
| "A living laboratory of how humanity organizes survival." | "They document everything. Strange but harmless." |

Scriptorium outposts in major towns. Ethnographic documentation. Trade for food surplus in exchange for technical knowledge.

### Forsaken: Limited Contact

| Forsaken View | Combine View |
|---------------|--------------|
| "Midgarders complain about hard winters. They have no concept of true scarcity." | "Ice-Debt refugees. Poor souls." |
| "Their 'poverty' would be our wealth." | "What happens when agriculture fails completely." |

Niflheim refugees occasionally seek Combine settlement. Cultural friction between Forsaken survival calculus and Combine communal norms.

### Scavenger Barons: Hostile Competition

| Baron View | Combine View |
|------------|--------------|
| "Soft farmers who grow food we need." | "Forces of nature—brutal, inevitable." |
| "Prosperous villages make good recruitment pools." | "Trading kind or recruiting kind? Hide the young folk." |

The Barons are not friends, not Jarls, not quite human—they are weather to be endured.

## Strategic Assessments

### Strengths

| Strength | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Agricultural Dominance** | Only reliable large-scale food producer in Aethelgard |
| **Distributed Resilience** | No single point of failure threatens entire confederation |
| **Adaptive Flexibility** | Local autonomy enables regional optimization |
| **Economic Centrality** | All factions depend on Combine trade |
| **Cultural Stability** | Oral tradition and seasonal rhythms preserve identity |

### Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Slow Mobilization** | Voluntary coordination vs. centralized command |
| **Infrastructure Deterioration** | Maintenance costs rising; traffic declining 70% from peak |
| **Factional Pressure** | Iron-Banes/God-Sleepers competing for population loyalty |
| **Climate Deterioration** | Growing seasons shortening; hazard zones expanding |
| **Succession Crises** | Jarl authority collapses if protective capability fails |

### The Paradox of Decentralization

The Combine's greatest strength—its decentralized flexibility—simultaneously constitutes its greatest vulnerability:

| Strength | Corresponding Weakness |
|----------|------------------------|
| Cannot be destroyed by capturing capital | Cannot mobilize rapidly for coordinated action |
| Local laws enable regional adaptation | Cannot enforce universal standards |
| No single point of failure | Cannot prevent internal blood-feuds |
| Too distributed to conquer | Too distributed to unite |

### Agricultural Work Cycles

| Season | Work Hours | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Summer** | 14-16 hours | High-intensity weeding, pest management |
| **Winter** | 8-10 hours | Essential maintenance, tool repair |
| **Spring/Autumn** | 10-12 hours | Moderate intensity |
| **Spring Planting** | 16+ hours | 6-8 week intensive period; rest-days suspended |
| **Autumn Harvest** | Dawn-to-dusk | 4-6 week mobilization; all available labor |

### Timekeeping

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the heartland where the gods once made their paradise, the Hearth-Clans have built something new from the ashes. They are not crusaders seeking purity or scholars seeking truth or slaves seeking warmth—they are farmers, ranchers, traders, and defenders who have chosen to believe in the harvest and the Wall. Their heroes are not prophets but the grizzled Rangers who keep the roads safe and the master farmers who coax grain from Blighted earth. They gather at Harvest-Moot to name the year and settle their disputes, they honor their dead with Memory-Stones that list the deeds of the fallen, and they set aside the Ghost's Share at every meal for those lost to the wastes. They are pragmatic, stubborn, and fiercely independent—each Jarl sovereign within their walls, each Hold a small kingdom unto itself, yet bound together by witnessed contracts and mutual need. The Iron-Banes call them soft. The God-Sleepers call them faithless. But the Dvergr call them what they are: the Heartland. The breadbasket. The closest thing the Age of Echoes has to a future."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Midgard Combine represents post-Glitch humanity's most successful large-scale political organization—a decentralized confederation of 200-300 agricultural Holds spanning approximately 500,000 square kilometers with an estimated population of 150,000-200,000. Unlike theocratic movements or rigid hierarchical systems, the Combine achieves coordination through overlapping trade networks, witnessed contracts, and seasonal assemblies preserving local autonomy. Agricultural production (Grit-Corn: 8-12 tons/hectare Good Earth, 3-5 tons Ash-Fall Earth) provides 60-70% of surface-realm grain supply, creating economic leverage over all other factions. Institutional resilience through redundancy—no single point of failure threatens the entire confederation. The Combine's greatest strength (decentralized flexibility) simultaneously constitutes its greatest vulnerability: slow military mobilization, inability to enforce universal standards, and susceptibility to internal fragmentation during blood-feuds or factional recruitment pressure."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"FACTION CLASSIFICATION: Midgard Combine (Heartland Alliance). ORGANIZATIONAL TYPE: Decentralized agricultural confederation; autonomous Hold-level governance with seasonal Council coordination. PRIMARY FUNCTION: Agricultural production and trade network maintenance. SECONDARY FUNCTION: Population center for post-Glitch human civilization. POPULATION: 150,000-200,000 across 200-300 Holds. TERRITORY: ~500,000 sq km across Midgard realm habitable zones. GOVERNANCE: Council of Jarls and Guild Masters (seasonal assembly); Jarl absolute authority within individual Holds. RISK PROFILE: Low (to external visitors operating through witnessed contracts); Moderate (during blood-feuds or factional conflicts). STRATEGIC ASSETS: 60-70% surface-realm grain production, trade route network, Rangers Guild infrastructure, distributed resilience. STRATEGIC LIABILITIES: No standing army, slow mobilization, infrastructure deterioration, factional recruitment pressure."*

## Summary

The Midgard Combine's greatest strength is its greatest weakness.

Its pragmatism and lack of a single, unifying dogma make it resilient, adaptable, and tolerant. But this same lack of unity makes it vulnerable to the influence of more fanatical Creeds, and its quiet, agrarian peace is a fragile thing—perpetually threatened by the horrors of the ruins that surround it and the ideological storms that rage within its own borders.

Where the Iron-Banes have faith, the Combine has the harvest.

Where the God-Sleepers have hope, the Combine has the Wall.

Where the Jötun-Readers have knowledge, the Combine has the Skald's memory.

Where the Scavenger Barons have the Ice-Debt, the Combine has the witnessed contract.

They are farmers, ranchers, artisans, and traders. They value a strong wall, a full granary, and a sharp spear over ancient history or abstract dogma. Their heroes are not great crusaders or scholars, but the grizzled Rangers who keep the roads safe and the master farmers who can coax a harvest from the Blighted earth.

They do not seek to purify the world.

They do not seek to awaken the gods.

They do not seek to understand the past.

They seek only to survive another season, to fill another granary, to defend another wall—and to pass on to their children the stubborn, practical wisdom that has kept humanity alive in the heartland of a broken world.

The Iron-Banes call them soft.

The God-Sleepers call them faithless.

The Jötun-Readers call them ignorant.

But the Dvergr call them something else.

**The Heartland.**

And in a world of zealots, scholars, and slavers, sometimes the most radical act is simply to grow food, raise children, and keep the wall standing for one more generation.

That is the Midgard Combine.

The breadbasket of a broken age.

The closest thing the Age of Echoes has to a future.
