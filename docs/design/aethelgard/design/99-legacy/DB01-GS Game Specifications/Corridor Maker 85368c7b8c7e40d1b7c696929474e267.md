## Thematic Description

> *"You have become the master of dead places. Where others see tombs, you see harvest routes. Where others flee anomalies, you document, catalog, and convert danger into knowledge."*
> 

The Corridor Maker has transcended mere survival in ruins—you have become their **sovereign**. Every dead corridor yields its secrets to your survey, every hazard becomes a documented feature, every anomaly a cataloged phenomenon. You don't explore ruins; you **claim them**.

## Mechanical Implementation

### Passive Component: Ruin Mastery

**Base Effect (Rank 1)**:

- **Auto-Success**: Automatically succeed on all **Minor** and **Moderate** trap/anomaly interactions
- **Survey Bonus**: +4d10 to all **WITS checks** in Old World environments
- **Party Leadership**: Party gains **+2d10** to all checks while following your lead

**Rank 2**:

- **Extended Auto-Success**: Automatic success extends to **Severe** hazards
- **Party Bonus**: Increases to **+3d10**
- **PP Cost**: 6

**Rank 3**:

- **Total Awareness**: Can sense **all** anomalies and traps within **30 meters**
- **CPS Sharing**: Party gains your **CPS Resistance bonuses** while in your presence
- **PP Cost**: 6

---

### Active Component: Systematic Survey

**Trigger**: Full Turn — **Once per location**

**Cost**: 50 Stamina

**Effect**: Conduct comprehensive survey of current location (room, corridor, chamber)

**Reveals**:

- All **traps, anomalies, and hazards** (including hidden ones)
- All **hidden caches, passages, and valuables**
- **Optimal route** through with danger ratings
- **CPS exposure estimate** for full exploration

**Rank 2**:

- Also reveals **enemy positions** and **patrol patterns**
- Can be conducted in **half the time**
- **PP Cost**: 6

**Rank 3**:

- Survey creates **permanent record** usable by other parties
- Reveals **weaknesses** in any active systems (+50% damage vs systems)
- **PP Cost**: 6

## Survey Output Example

```
SYSTEMATIC SURVEY: Chamber 7-B
─────────────────────────────────
▲ HAZARDS:
  - Pressure plate (NE corner) [Moderate]
  - Echo Surface (west wall) [Severe]
  - Singing Vent (ceiling) [Moderate]
  
☆ CACHES:
  - Concealed panel (behind debris)
  - Old World container (intact)
  
→ OPTIMAL ROUTE:
  Entry → South wall → Cache 1 → Cache 2 → Exit
  
⏱ CPS ESTIMATE: 8 minutes safe exposure
```

## Synergies

### Internal (Ruin-Stalker Tree)

- **Anomaly Sense I**: Capstone builds on detection foundation
- **Hazard Mapping**: Systematic Survey creates superior maps
- **CPS Resistance**: Rank 3 shares your protection with party
- **All abilities**: Capstone enhances entire toolkit

### External (Party Composition)

- **Salvage teams**: Survey reveals all valuables
- **Jötun-Reader**: Survey + translation = complete site analysis
- **Future expeditions**: Permanent records benefit others

---

## Tactical Applications

### Site Claim Protocol

1. Enter new location
2. Activate Systematic Survey
3. Document all findings
4. Execute optimal route
5. Extract valuables
6. Create permanent record

### Party Leadership

With Rank 3:

- Party gains your CPS Resistance
- +3d10 to all checks while following
- Enables extended operations in dangerous areas
