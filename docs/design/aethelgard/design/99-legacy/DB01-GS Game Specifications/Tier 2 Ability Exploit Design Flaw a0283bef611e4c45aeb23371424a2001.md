## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Exploit Design Flaw is the Jötun-Reader's **primary offensive support ability**—the coordinated strike. After identifying a flaw, they communicate it to allies with precise instructions, transforming raw intelligence into a devastating tactical advantage.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Apply [Analyzed] debuff to target
- **Secondary:** Grant +2 Accuracy to all allies attacking that target
- **Prerequisite:** Requires successful Analyze Weakness first
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The shouted command that turns chaos into precision

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Very High (party-wide Accuracy buff)
- **Setup Required:** Two-turn combo (Analyze → Exploit)
- **Duration Limited:** 2 rounds means timing matters
- **Force Multiplier:** Best value in longer boss fights

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The analysis is complete. Now comes the **instruction**.

*"Aim for the unshielded power conduit just below the third thoracic plate! The armor's stress distribution is weakest at the ventral junction! Strike NOW!"*

The Jötun-Reader's voice cuts through the chaos of battle—clear, precise, authoritative. Their allies' wild swings become surgical strikes. Their desperate attacks become coordinated takedowns.

This is not magic. This is **tactical supremacy**.

### Thematic Resonance

Exploit Design Flaw transforms the Jötun-Reader from passive analyst into active battlefield tactician—proof that the right information at the right moment is worth a dozen warriors.

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

### Negative Synergies

- **Short encounters:** Two-turn setup not worth it
- **Many weak enemies:** Better to just attack than buff against fodder
- **Solo play:** Only benefits allies, not self
