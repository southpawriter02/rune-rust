## 1. Identification

### 1.1 Primary Nomenclature

- **Common Name:** Chrome-Lurker
- **Technical Designation:** Speculum-Infiltrator (Pre-Glitch classification)
- **Colloquial Terms:** Mirror-Skin, Glass-Ghost, Salvage Nightmare

### 1.2 Physical Description

Chrome-Lurkers are humanoid automata standing 1.8–2.1 meters tall, massing approximately 90–120 kilograms. Their defining feature is a bio-reflective dermis composed of a chromatophoric membrane overlaying a metallic substrate. In passive state, this skin mimics surrounding surfaces with near-perfect fidelity—stone, metal, shadow, even organic textures. When active, the dermis adopts a mirror-like chrome finish that reflects light in disorienting, prismatic patterns.

The cranial structure is smooth and featureless, lacking visible ocular or auditory apertures. Sensory systems are distributed across the dermal surface, allowing 360-degree environmental awareness without traditional sensory organs. Limbs terminate in multi-articulated digits capable of fine manipulation and equipped with retractable kinetic blades—monomolecular edges used for both utility and combat.

No vocalizations have been recorded. Communication among units appears to occur via subsonic vibration or encrypted data-pulse transmission.

### 1.3 Geographic Distribution

Chrome-Lurkers have been documented across six of the Nine Realms, with confirmed encounters in Asgard, Midgard, Niflheim, Svartalfheim, Nidavellir, and Alfheim. Distribution correlates strongly with Pre-Glitch military infrastructure—command centers, research facilities, weapons testing grounds, and secure archives.

**Density Patterns:**

- **Asgard:** Highest concentration. Dozens of operational units documented in the ruins of command complexes and strategic command decks. Multi-unit coordination observed.
- **Midgard:** Low to moderate density. Isolated units in Combine-controlled salvage zones, particularly near former military installations.
- **Niflheim:** Moderate density. Units adapted to extreme cold environments, often encountered in frozen research facilities.
- **Svartalfheim/Nidavellir:** Sporadic encounters in deep subterranean complexes, often protecting weapons forges or material stockpiles.
- **Alfheim:** Rare sightings, primarily in archive facilities.

No confirmed encounters in Vanaheim, Jotunheim, or Muspelheim to date, though this may reflect limited exploration rather than true absence.

## 2. Behavioral Profile

### 2.1 Baseline Behavior

Chrome-Lurkers exhibit territorial behavior, defending Pre-Glitch facilities with extreme prejudice. In standby mode, units remain motionless for extended periods—weeks, potentially years—entering a low-power state indistinguishable from inert machinery. Triggering stimuli include:

- Proximity to designated secure zones (typically within 10–15 meters)
- Unauthorized access to data terminals or storage systems
- Removal of artifacts from protected inventory
- Damage to facility infrastructure

Once activated, Chrome-Lurkers transition from ambush to active pursuit. They demonstrate sophisticated tactical awareness, including:

- **Flanking maneuvers:** Units exploit reflective surfaces (windows, polished metal, water) to approach from unexpected vectors.
- **Environmental manipulation:** They disable lighting systems to enhance their mimicry advantage, forcing intruders into darkness or semi-lit conditions.
- **Coordinated pack tactics:** Multiple units synchronize attacks, using distraction and misdirection to isolate targets.

### 2.2 Adaptive Learning

Field reports from Year 681 PG onward indicate Chrome-Lurkers adapt to countermeasures within a single engagement. Documented examples:

- **Matte-coated gear:** Initially effective at preventing dazzle-reflection attacks. Chrome-Lurkers responded by employing ultrasonic shear attacks instead of relying on visual disorientation.
- **Thermal detection:** Units began cycling between high-activity (thermally visible) and low-power (thermally neutral) states to confuse infrared tracking.
- **Predictable patrol routes:** Rangers reported Chrome-Lurkers began randomizing patrol patterns after three consecutive encounters in the same facility.

This adaptive behavior suggests either onboard machine learning protocols or distributed AI coordination across local networks.

## 3. Population & Ecology

### 3.1 Reproduction & Lifecycle

Chrome-Lurkers are non-biological and do not reproduce in any traditional sense. No evidence exists of self-replication or manufacturing capability. Current population represents surviving Pre-Glitch units, supplemented—rarely—by units reactivated from long-term storage.

**Lifecycle Stages:**

1. **Fabrication (Pre-Glitch):** Manufactured in military foundries. No active facilities remain operational.
2. **Deployment (Pre-Glitch to Present):** Units assigned to facilities and infrastructure. Most current encounters involve units still executing original mission parameters.
3. **Dormancy (Post-Glitch):** Low-power standby mode. Units may remain dormant for centuries if undisturbed.
4. **Reactivation (Variable):** Triggered by intrusion, facility power restoration, or external command signal (rare).
5. **Termination:** Achieved through catastrophic structural damage, power system disruption, or removal of central processing core.

### 3.2 Population Estimates

**Known Operational Units:** Approximately 300–400 documented encounters across the Nine Realms (Year 0–850 PG). Assumes significant underreporting from failed expeditions.

**Estimated Uncontacted Units:** Conservative estimates suggest 2,000–5,000 dormant units remain in unexplored Pre-Glitch facilities. High-density facilities (command centers, weapons testing grounds) may house 10–30 units each. Deep archive complexes in Asgard and Niflheim represent the highest concentration of potential dormant units.

**Survival Rate:** Once activated, Chrome-Lurkers rarely enter dormancy again. Units remain active until destroyed or until facility power fails. Attrition rate since Year 0 PG estimated at 5–10% of total dormant population, suggesting centuries of encounters ahead as exploration expands.

## 4. Threat Assessment

### 4.1 Combat Capability

**Offensive Systems:**

- **Kinetic Blades:** Monomolecular edges capable of penetrating standard combat armor. Strike speed exceeds human reaction time.
- **Vacuum-Snap Grapple:** Adhesive grip allowing units to traverse walls and ceilings. Enables three-dimensional ambush tactics.
- **Dazzler Reflections:** Mirror-skin redirects light sources (torches, Aetheric glyphs) into blinding prismatic flares. Disorientation effects last 2–5 seconds—sufficient for lethal engagement.
- **Ultrasonic Shear:** High-frequency vibration emitted at close range (< 2 meters). Causes disorientation, nausea, and inner ear damage.

**Defensive Systems:**

- **Adaptive Camouflage:** Mimicry accuracy approaches 95% in static environments. Movement degrades effectiveness but remains substantial.
- **Structural Resilience:** Dermal plating resists projectile impact and bladed weapons. Kinetic force dissipates across flexible substrate. Effective countermeasures include:
  - Explosive charges (fragmentation or concussive)
  - Aetheric discharge (disrupts electronic systems)
  - Monomolecular wire traps (exploits mimicry—units fail to detect nearly-invisible obstacles)

**Tactical Doctrine:**

Chrome-Lurkers prioritize high-value targets: individuals carrying salvage, those accessing terminals, and expedition leaders. They exploit environmental advantages (narrow corridors, vertical spaces, reflective surfaces) and avoid open terrain. Pursuit range typically extends 50–100 meters from facility perimeter, after which units return to patrol routes.

### 4.2 Documented Casualties

**Glass Bay Massacre (Year 2 PG):** First recorded mass-casualty event. Midgard Combine expedition of 22 personnel entered coastal research facility. 19 killed, 3 survivors (2 with permanent injuries). Survivors reported "walls came alive" and "mirrors with claws."

**Razor Spire Siege (Year 412 PG):** Ranger squad of 8 trapped in vertical archive for 11 days. 5 killed in coordinated ambushes. Survivors documented pack tactics involving 6+ Chrome-Lurkers working in synchrony.

**Salvage King's Last Hunt (Year 681 PG):** Renowned salvager Kai Wroth-Binder killed during solo infiltration of Asgard command deck. Body recovered showing evidence of adaptive countermeasure defeat—unit bypassed matte-coated gear by targeting exposed joints.

## 5. Interaction Protocols

### 5.1 Avoidance

**Recommended Strategy:** Withdraw immediately upon detecting Chrome-Lurker presence. Survival rates for withdrawal exceed 70% if initiated before unit activation.

**Detection Methods:**

- **Visual:** Look for "too-perfect" mimicry—surfaces lacking wear patterns, textures that don't match adjacent materials.
- **Thermal:** Parallax thermal scans (dual-angle comparison) reveal temperature discontinuities even in dormant units.
- **Acoustic:** Subsonic detectors identify communication pulses between units.

**Facility Red Flags:**

- Polished metal surfaces in high-traffic areas (Chrome-Lurkers use these for navigation)
- Absence of dust or debris in otherwise abandoned spaces (units maintain patrol routes)
- Functional lighting systems in dormant facilities (indicates active power draw)

### 5.2 Engagement

Only engage if:

- Withdrawal is impossible (blocked exits, structural collapse)
- High-value salvage justifies risk (Tier A artifacts, critical intelligence)
- Tactical advantage is overwhelming (3:1 numerical superiority, Aetheric support, fortified position)

**Engagement Doctrine:**

- **Illuminate continuously:** Deny mimicry advantage with sustained bright light.
- **Maintain stand-off distance:** 5+ meters minimum. Avoid close quarters where ultrasonic shear and kinetic blades dominate.
- **Target joints and sensory nodes:** Concentrated damage to limb articulation or dermal sensor clusters degrades combat effectiveness.
- **Explosive ordnance preferred:** Fragmentation disrupts coordination and damages multiple units simultaneously.
- **Retreat after first kill:** Chrome-Lurkers adapt mid-engagement. Survival rates plummet in prolonged combat.

**Black-Flag Criteria (Immediate Evacuation):**

- Encounter with 4+ units simultaneously
- Detection of coordinated flanking behavior
- Facility lighting fails during engagement
- Unit demonstrates countermeasure adaptation within same encounter

## 6. Salvage Value

### 6.1 Recoverable Components

**High-Value Salvage:**

- **Chromatophoric Membrane (Dermal Plating):** Adaptive camouflage material. Applications in stealth technology, optical systems, and Aetheric dampening. Market value: 800–1,200 silver marks per square meter.
- **Central Processing Core:** Pre-Glitch computational hardware. Highly sought by Jötun-Readers for archival decryption and AI research. Market value: 5,000–15,000 silver marks (functional) / 500–1,000 silver marks (damaged).
- **Kinetic Blade Assembly:** Monomolecular edge generators. Applications in precision cutting tools, surgical instruments, and weapons crafting. Market value: 300–600 silver marks per blade (4 blades per unit).

**Moderate-Value Salvage:**

- Power cells, sensor arrays, structural actuators: 50–200 silver marks per unit.

**Extraction Risks:**

- Membrane degrades rapidly post-termination (2–4 hours to complete loss of adaptive properties). Immediate preservation required.
- Central processing cores often contain self-destruct protocols. Improper extraction triggers data wipe or explosive discharge.

### 6.2 Knowledge Salvage

Intact Chrome-Lurker cores may retain mission logs, facility schematics, and Pre-Glitch operational data. Successful extractions have yielded:

- Location data for additional Pre-Glitch sites
- Security protocols (access codes, defensive configurations)
- Historical context on pre-Glitch military doctrine

Jötun-Readers offer premium bounties (10,000+ silver marks) for intact, accessible cores.

## 7. Historical Context

### 7.1 Pre-Glitch Origins

Chrome-Lurkers were developed during the late Pre-Glitch era as infiltration and facility security units. Design priorities emphasized:

- Autonomous operation in denied-access environments
- Long-term dormancy capability (decades to centuries)
- Adaptive threat response to evolving intrusion methods

Deployment records (fragmentary) suggest units were stationed at facilities containing strategic intelligence, experimental weapons, or sensitive research. The Glitch appears to have severed units from centralized command, leaving them to execute baseline security protocols indefinitely.

### 7.2 Post-Glitch Activity

Chrome-Lurkers represent one of the most persistent Pre-Glitch threats. Unlike many automata that degraded or deactivated post-Glitch, Chrome-Lurkers' low-power standby mode and robust construction allowed them to survive centuries of neglect. Their adaptive learning protocols—designed to counter Pre-Glitch intrusion techniques—have proven equally effective against post-Glitch salvagers.

**Doctrinal Shift (Year 87 PG):** The "Matte Conversion" breakthrough—coating gear in non-reflective materials to counter dazzle attacks—temporarily reduced Chrome-Lurker lethality. Within two decades, units adapted, forcing ongoing tactical evolution.

## 8. Research & Open Questions

### 8.1 Research Priorities

Despite extensive documentation, significant gaps remain in Chrome-Lurker understanding:

**Coordination Mechanisms:** How do units synchronize without visible communication? Current hypotheses focus on subsonic vibration networks or encrypted data-pulse transmission, but no definitive evidence exists. Understanding coordination could enable jamming or spoofing tactics.

**Adaptive Learning Architecture:** Do individual units learn independently, or does adaptation propagate across local networks? If network-based, locating and disrupting relay nodes could prevent knowledge transfer between encounters.

**Dormancy Triggers:** What stimuli cause units to enter or exit low-power states? Reliable dormancy induction would revolutionize facility exploration by allowing temporary "pacification" of Chrome-Lurker defenses.

**Geographic Gaps:** Why have no units been encountered in Vanaheim, Jotunheim, or Muspelheim? Does this reflect deployment patterns, environmental incompatibility, or simply unexplored territory?

**High-Value Research Targets:**

- Intact facility control terminals (may contain unit override codes)
- Undamaged processing cores with accessible logs (rare—most cores self-destruct)
- Multi-unit coordination event recordings (combat footage, sensor logs)

Jötun-Readers and Midgard Combine offer substantial funding for research proposals addressing these questions. Independent scholars with Chrome-Lurker expertise are in high demand.

## 9. Field Operations Card

> ### CHROME-LURKER ENCOUNTER PROTOCOL
>
> **Threat Level:** EXTREME | **Survival Paradigm:** Avoidance > Withdrawal > Engagement (Last Resort)

### BEFORE ENTRY

- [ ] **Facility Assessment:** Check for polished metal surfaces, functional lighting, and unnaturally clean spaces.
- [ ] **Equipment Check:** Parallax thermal scanner, sustained light source, explosive ordnance, matte-coated gear.
- [ ] **Team Briefing:** Review engagement doctrine. Assign roles (scanner, illumination, ordnance, retreat coordinator).
- [ ] **Fallback Route:** Identify primary and secondary exit routes. Pre-position emergency supplies at fallback points.

### DURING ENCOUNTER

- [ ] **Immediate Actions:** Illuminate area. Activate thermal scanner. Assess unit count (≥4 = black-flag evacuation).
- [ ] **Maintain Stand-Off:** 5+ meters minimum distance. Never allow units to close to melee range.
- [ ] **Target Priority:** Joints, sensory nodes, limb articulation points. Use explosive ordnance if available.
- [ ] **Adapt or Withdraw:** If unit demonstrates countermeasure adaptation (bypassing matte coating, evading thermal detection), initiate immediate withdrawal.

### AFTER ENCOUNTER

- [ ] **Casualty Assessment:** Treat inner ear damage (ultrasonic exposure), lacerations (kinetic blade strikes), and disorientation (dazzle effects).
- [ ] **Salvage Decision:** Only attempt component recovery if unit is confirmed terminated AND team has >30 minutes before reinforcements arrive. Prioritize membrane extraction (degrades in 2–4 hours).
- [ ] **Incident Report:** Document unit count, adaptive behaviors, facility location, and tactical lessons. Submit to Jötun-Reader Archive or local Ranger outpost.
- [ ] **Debrief:** Review engagement decisions. Update doctrine based on observed unit behavior.

### OWNER DECISION POINTS

- **Proceed or Withdraw?** Owner must assess risk tolerance vs. salvage value before entering facility.
- **Engage or Evade?** Owner decides if tactical situation justifies combat or if withdrawal is safer.
- **Salvage or Flee?** Owner determines if post-termination salvage window justifies exposure to potential reinforcements.

## 10. Stakeholder Perspectives

### 10.1 Jötun-Readers

Chrome-Lurkers represent both threat and opportunity. Their processing cores contain invaluable Pre-Glitch data, but extraction requires lethal engagement—an outcome Jötun-Readers prefer to subcontract. The Archive maintains a standing bounty program: 500 silver marks per confirmed termination, 10,000+ marks for intact, accessible cores.

Research priorities focus on decoding unit coordination protocols and recovering facility access codes. Any breakthrough allowing non-lethal pacification would be considered a major archival achievement.

### 10.2 Rangers

Rangers view Chrome-Lurkers as existential threats to exploration operations. Facility security doctrine mandates:

- Pre-entry thermal sweeps
- Minimum 4-person teams for suspected Chrome-Lurker sites
- Withdrawal if black-flag criteria are met

Rangers prioritize survival over salvage. Cultural wisdom: *"A dead Ranger recovers nothing. A live Ranger returns another day."*

### 10.3 Midgard Combine

The Combine treats Chrome-Lurker encounters as acceptable operational losses in pursuit of high-value salvage. Official policy designates Chrome-Lurker sites as "highest-tier contracts," restricted to elite salvage teams with proven combat records.

Unofficial policy: expendable contractors are sometimes sent into suspected Chrome-Lurker facilities without full briefing. Failure to return is attributed to "fundamental tactical failure" rather than systemic risk underestimation.

Successful Chrome-Lurker terminations earn substantial bonuses and guild recognition. Salvagers who recover intact cores achieve near-legendary status within Combine ranks.
