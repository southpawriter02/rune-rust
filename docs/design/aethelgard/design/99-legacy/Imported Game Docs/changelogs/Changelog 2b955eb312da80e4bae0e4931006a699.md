- **Secondary Attribute:** FINESSE
- **Resource System:** Stamina + Psychic Stress
- **Trauma Risk:** High
- **Unlock Requirements:** Legend 3+

### Core Philosophy

The Jötun-Reader is a forensic pathologist of the apocalypse who reads crash logs of a dead civilization. They observe and document system failures with clinical precision, analyze enemy weaknesses, translate runic inscriptions, apply tactical debuffs, and weaponize forbidden knowledge. High Trauma Risk creates dependency on Bone-Setter support. Non-combat specialist who enables party success through pure knowledge.

    - `RuneAndRust.Engine/SpecializationFactory.cs` - Updated ability initialization with full rank progression
    - `RuneAndRust.Tests/SpecializationIntegrationTests.cs` - Validation test already exists

### Design Philosophy

- **Information Warfare:** Analyze Weakness reveals defenses, Exploit Design Flaw grants party accuracy

- **Trauma Economy Integration:** Most abilities cost Psychic Stress, creating high-risk/high-reward gameplay
- **Force Multiplier:** Contributes zero direct damage but increases party effectiveness by 30-40%

### Balance Considerations

- **Psychic Stress Management:** Budget 5 Stress per Analyze, 15-20 per Architect use
- **Party Accuracy Boost:** [Analyzed] debuff increases hit rate by 10-15%
- **Runic Translation:** Gates 20-30% of dungeon secrets
- **Strategic Weakness:** Weak solo play, requires Bone-Setter support, no combat-only dungeon viability

### Synergies

- **Scholarly Acumen + Runic Linguistics:** Perfect translation with massive investigation bonuses
- **Calculated Triage + Bone-Setter:** Combined 75%+ healing boost
