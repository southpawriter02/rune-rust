## Core Identity

**The Ultimate Survivor** represents **perfect harmony with the wastes**. You're no longer struggling—you've **become part of it**. A ghost in ruins, never without a solution. **You have mastered the art of enduring.**

---

## Mechanics

### Part 1: Universal Competence (Passive)

**Effect:** +1d10 to ALL non-combat skills you lack proficiency in

**Applies to:**

- System Bypass (locks, traps, terminals)
- Social skills (Persuasion, Deception)
- Crafting, Medicine, any utility skill

**Result:** Competent at literally everything

### Part 2: Blight Haven (Active)

**Cost:** Free Action (out of combat), once per expedition

**Effect:** Designate cleared room as [Hidden Camp]

**When resting in [Hidden Camp]:**

- **0% Ambush chance** (guaranteed safety)
- +10 to all recovery rolls
- **No environmental Stress gain**
- Perfectly safe rest despite hostile territory

### Rank Progression

| Rank | PP Cost | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 6 | Base effects |
| 2 | 50 | +2d10 Universal Competence, Blight Haven usable twice |
| 3 | 60 | +3d10, Blight Haven three times, grants temporary HP buff |

## Tactical Applications

**Universal Competence:**

```
Party encounters locked Ancient Terminal
No hacker in party!

Karla attempts System Bypass:
Base: WITS 3 = 3d10
Universal Competence: +1d10
Total: 4d10 vs DC 16 → Success!

Jack of all trades, master of survival.
```

**Blight Haven:**

```
Party: 5 days into Blighted Ruins
├─ Psychic Stress: 55-65 (approaching critical)
├─ HP: 60-70% (moderate damage)
└─ Need safe rest desperately

Karla: "This room. We rest here."
BLIGHT HAVEN ACTIVATED!

[HIDDEN CAMP] created:
├─ 0% Ambush (no enemies attack)
├─ +10 recovery rolls
├─ No Stress gain (environmental blocked)
└─ Perfect safety

Next morning: Party refreshed, expedition continues
```

**Synergies:**

- **Live off the Land:** Complete expedition self-sufficiency
- **Wasteland Wanderer:** Environmental invulnerability
- **All abilities:** Culmination of survival mastery

## Failure Modes

<aside>
⚠️

**Specialist-Tier Challenges** — +1d10 makes you competent, not expert. DC 22+ challenges designed for specialists will still fail.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Blight Haven Timing** — Once per expedition = critical decision. Using early wastes potential for later crises.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Location Strategy** — Blight Haven in poor location may never be revisited. Designate rooms on likely travel routes.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Exotic Threats** — "Immune to common hazards" has limits. Pre-Glitch experimental weapons may bypass resistance.

## Thematic Moment

> *This is your defining moment as Einbúi. When the party is lost, exhausted, hunted in hostile territory—you find the one perfect sanctuary. You create safety from nothing. The party sleeps soundly because you keep watch.*

> **"You are safe. I have made it so."**
