## Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Common Lore

> "In the time of the ancestors, warriors carried weapons of fire and lightning—blades that burned with the heart of small suns, bows that shot bolts of pure light, hammers that called thunder from the sky. These were the god-weapons, the star-forgers, the tools that let mortal hands shape the world.
>
> Then the world broke, and the god-weapons broke with it.
>
> Now the fire-blades burn their wielders. The light-bows blind those who draw them. The thunder-hammers strike down those who lift them. The god-weapons remember their makers, and they are angry.
>
> So we forge new weapons. Simple weapons. Honest weapons. Axes that cut and nothing more. Swords that slash and nothing else. Hammers that crush and fall silent. These weapons do not think. They do not remember. They do not judge.
>
> The Dvergr call this wisdom. We call it survival.
>
> The god-weapons sleep in the high ruins, beautiful and deadly, waiting for fools brave enough to wake them. Let them sleep. Let them dream of the ancestors they killed. Let them rot in their cradles of corrupted light.
>
> Our weapons are steel and silence. And silence never betrays."

**Permitted vocabulary:** god-weapons, star-forgers, fire-blades, thunder-hammers, the ancestors, the breaking, steel and silence, the Dvergr wisdom

## Layer 2 (Diagnostic) — Jötun-Reader Analysis

> "WEAPON SYSTEMS ASSESSMENT — POST-GLITCH STANDARDIZATION
>
> The fundamental shift from Aesir-era armaments to contemporary weapon systems represents deliberate technological regression in response to catastrophic Aetheric contamination. Pre-Glitch weapons integrated Aetheric power cores, AI-assisted targeting matrices, and networked safety protocols—all systems vulnerable to Blight corruption following Yggdrasil Network severance.
>
> Documented malfunction patterns in pre-Glitch weaponry: targeting system inversion (friend-or-foe classification failure), power core destabilization (uncontrolled discharge), safety protocol erasure (user identification failure), autonomous activation (weapons operating without wielder input). Combined malfunction probability: 73% within 60 seconds of activation.
>
> Contemporary weapon systems (Pure Principles manufacture): zero Aetheric components; purely mechanical function; no integrated intelligence; no network dependency. Malfunction modes limited to physical degradation (material fatigue, edge dulling, mechanism wear)—predictable, preventable, repairable.
>
> Recommended field protocol: pre-Glitch weapons classified as hazardous artifacts; activation prohibited without containment protocols; Blight-inert alternatives preferred for all combat applications."

**Permitted vocabulary:** Aetheric contamination, malfunction probability, Pure Principles, targeting matrix, power core destabilization, Blight corruption, network severance
**Prohibited vocabulary:** Mythic epithets, god-weapons, ancestor-curses, poetic framing

## Layer 3 (Technical) — Pre-Glitch Reference

> "AESIR ENGINEERING DIVISION — PERSONAL ARMAMENTS SPECIFICATION
>
> STANDARD ISSUE: Ullr-Pattern Precision Rifle (long-range engagement); Tyr-Pattern Combat Blade (close-quarters); Svalinn-Pattern Kinetic Projector (personal defense)
>
> POWER SOURCE: Miniaturized Aetheric cells; 72-hour operational capacity; network-assisted recharge via Yggdrasil Grid integration
>
> TARGETING SYSTEM: AI-assisted precision module; friend-or-foe identification via biometric scan + network authentication; automated threat prioritization
>
> SAFETY PROTOCOLS: Biometric grip lock (authorized users only); failsafe discharge prevention; network-monitored status reporting
>
> POST-GLITCH STATUS: All systems compromised. Network severance disabled safety protocols. Aetheric contamination destabilized power cells. AI corruption inverted targeting logic. CLASSIFICATION: HAZARDOUS. ACTIVATION PROHIBITED."

**Permitted vocabulary:** Aesir Engineering Division, Ullr-Pattern, biometric authentication, failsafe protocol, network integration, AI-assisted targeting
**Prohibited vocabulary:** Survivor cant, mythic framing, diagnostic interpretation
