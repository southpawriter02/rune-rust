## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Pre-Glitch Designation** | Canis-Silentium Pattern Psychic Tracker |
| **Common Names** | Echo-Hound, Ghost-Hound, Barracks-Demon, Ice-King's Hound |
| **Creature Type** | Blighted Beast (Bio-Engineered) |
| **Threat Tier** | Elite |
| **Primary Habitat** | Military installations, Niflheim (Great Glacier, Thawing Zones) |
| **Faction Alignment** | None (Feral) |

The Echo-Hound is not a spirit or a demon. It is a living, psychic bloodhound—a top-secret military tracker whose senses have been permanently scarred by the deafening psychic scream of a dying world. A phantom wolf that walks on paws of utter silence, hunting not by sight or scent, but by the very echo of a living thought.

> [!WARNING]
> **Extreme Cognitive Hazard.** Echo-Hounds amplify ambient psychic distress. Proximity to Valhalla Vault-07 dramatically increases lethality. Standard mental wards mandatory; Memory-Mirror Suppressant recommended.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: Project Fenrir

### Original Purpose

The Canis-Silentium Pattern Psychic Tracker was a highly classified military bio-asset developed by the Vanir during **Project Fenrir**, commissioned by the Aesir's intelligence and special operations divisions.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Primary Role** | Infiltration, espionage, tracking of high-value targets |
| **Operational Environment** | Secure, sterile environments where conventional tracking was impossible |
| **Classification** | Top Secret |

### Engineered Capabilities

| Trait | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **Psycho-Acoustic Reception** | Bio-crystalline nodes on skull detect residual psychic "echoes" left by sentient minds |
| **Silent Paws** | Bio-absorbent pads completely nullify movement sound on any surface |
| **Aetheric Cloak** | Hide subtly shifts Aetheric signature to mimic ambient background noise |
| **Sensory Mode** | No traditional ears or eyes; relies entirely on psychic detection |

The Canis-Silentium was the perfect ghost—a silent hunter designed for a world of secrets, capable of tracking a specific target by the faint, residual psychic echo of their thoughts.

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: Catastrophic Sensory Trauma

For a creature whose entire world was the subtle whisper of a mind, the Ginnungagap Glitch was an apocalypse of pure, deafening noise.

### The Eternal Scream

The instantaneous, collective death-scream of thousands of Einherjar pilots was a psychic shockwave of unimaginable power. This **"Eternal Scream"** permanently and catastrophically damaged the Canis-Silentium's delicate psycho-acoustic senses.

| Pre-Glitch | Post-Glitch |
|------------|-------------|
| Precision tracker | Indiscriminate predator |
| Differentiated psychic signatures | All minds = agonizing noise |
| Target-specific hunting | Compulsive noise elimination |
| Containment protocol adherence | Unbound, feral |

### Corrupted Purpose

The Echo-Hound's ability to differentiate between the subtle echo of a living mind and the raw, screaming static of the Runic Blight was destroyed. To an Echo-Hound:

- The silent, looping trauma of a **Forlorn** = agonizing noise
- The mindless, programmatic hum of an **Undying** = agonizing noise  
- The active, thinking mind of a **living human** = agonizing noise

Its purpose devolved from tracking specific targets to a desperate imperative: **silence the psychic noise that causes constant, unending pain.**

## Biology and Behavior

### Morphology

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Build** | Lean, powerful, canine-like |
| **Movement** | Unnerving, fluid grace; absolute silence |
| **Paws** | Naturally silent bio-absorbent pads |
| **Eyes** | Present but secondary; vestigial |
| **Primary Sense** | Bio-crystalline psycho-acoustic receptor array (scarred) |
| **Niflheim Adaptation** | Translucent blue-white fur; frost breath; cold-sharpened senses |

The Echo-Hound appears "half-shadow, half-smoke"—a lean, silent predator that makes no sound as it moves. Its breath frosts in frigid air, but its tread remains utterly silent.

### The Psychic Howl

The Echo-Hound's most devastating weapon is not physical—it is its **psychic howl**.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Type** | Localized high-intensity psychic broadcast |
| **Sound** | Not audible; directly affects minds |
| **Mechanism** | Emitted from bio-aetheric field |
| **Primary Effect** | Amplifies ambient "Slumbering Echoes" |

**Effects on Victims:**

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Rapid CPS Onset** | Accelerated Cognitive Paradox Syndrome symptoms |
| **Memory-Mirror Induction** | Forces victims to relive deepest fears and traumas |
| **Paranoia** | Intense, irrational paranoia and temporal confusion |
| **Auditory Hallucinations** | Often of lost loved ones screaming |
| **Aggression/Catatonia** | Victims driven to irrational aggression or mental collapse |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Near Valhalla Vault-07, the psychic howl functions as a **resonator**, amplifying the Slumbering Echoes emanating from the Vault—the collective, insane dream of the dead minds trapped within. The howl turns background psychic static into a focused, agonizing torrent.

### Hunting Behavior

Echo-Hounds are drawn to any significant psychic or Aetheric signature:

| Target | Perception | Behavior |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **Forlorn** | Traumatic loop = intense pain source | Relentless stalking; dismantling |
| **Undying** | Iron Heart hum = chaotic anomaly | Hunt to silence |
| **Living Beings** | Active consciousness = brilliant, agonizing beacon | Primary targets |

**Hunting Pattern:**
1. Silent approach using bio-absorbent pads
2. Close to optimal range undetected
3. Unleash psychic howl to disorient and incapacitate
4. Move in for physical kill

The victim often only realizes the Echo-Hound's presence once the mental assault begins.

## Niflheim Adaptation

Echo-Hounds that escaped into Niflheim adapted uniquely to the cryo-preserved environment:

| Adaptation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| **Camouflage** | Translucent blue-white fur blends with ice |
| **Cold-Sharpened Senses** | Extreme cold sharpens psychic detection |
| **Bio-Aetheric Heat Detection** | Pinpoints subtle warmth of living prey amid ambient cold |
| **Lair Location** | Labyrinthine ice caverns of Great Glacier and Thawing Zones |

### Ecosystem Interactions

| Species | Interaction |
|---------|-------------|
| **Hoarfrost Wolves** | Avoids direct confrontation; uses howl to panic prey or rival packs |
| **Cryo-Vörðr** | Less susceptible (machine nature); howl causes system errors in Blight-tainted units |

---

## Factional Interpretations

### Scavenger Barons — The Ice-King's Unseen Tax

To Niflheim Scavenger Barons, Echo-Hounds are feared as **"Spectral Hounds"**—an unpredictable, devastating threat. Losses are attributed to "the Glacier's Silent Maw" or "the Ice-King's unseen tax." The disorientation from psychic howls leads to catastrophic errors: sinking Dreadnoughts, wandering into Hoarfrost Wolf ambushes, or stumbling onto collapsing ice shelves.

### Iron-Banes — Tainted Hounds of the Old World

Iron-Banes view Echo-Hounds as manifestations of pre-Glitch technological "taint"—soulless demons born from the Age of Forging's hubris. They pragmatically acknowledge the Echo-Hound's effectiveness against Undying enemies, but consider them **tainted creatures that must ultimately be cleansed**.

| Posture | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **Pragmatic Tolerance** | Echo-Hounds hunt Undying effectively |
| **Ultimate Goal** | Cleansing; all old-world creations are corrupting |

### Jötun-Readers — The Biological Compass

To Jötun-Readers, a live Echo-Hound is a **priceless, if lethally dangerous, artifact**:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Living Psychic Detector** | Biological compass leading to psychic phenomena |
| **Forlorn Locator** | Can lead directly to undiscovered Forlorn |
| **Research Potential** | Sensory organs could enable safe Blight detection devices |

### God-Sleepers — Divine Omen

God-Sleepers who brave pilgrimages to Valhalla Vault-07 interpret psychic howls as **divine omens** or **purification rituals**. They may:
- View induced madness as a test of faith
- See Slumbering Echo amplification as communion with "holy martyrs"
- Actively seek these areas for enhanced "visions"

### Dvergr — Illogical Psychic Noise

Dvergr perceive the Echo-Hound's psychic howl as an **illogical anomaly**—a bio-engineered acoustic paradox that undermines their meticulous, non-Aetheric engineering principles. Primary response: avoidance and rigorous analysis to refine anti-Blight shielding.

### Environmental Synergies

| Location | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Military Ruins** | Lore-appropriate; ambush terrain |
| **Niflheim Glacier** | Cold resistance active; Hoarfrost Wolf potential complication |
| **Near Valhalla Vault-07** | Psychic Howl amplified; ambient Slumbering Echoes |
| **The Deep** | Acoustic propagation enhances Thought-Scent range |

### Tactical Considerations

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| **Detection** | Standard stealth useless; mental wards reduce Thought-Scent range |
| **Counter-Play** | High WILL characters resist Psychic Howl; Dvergr partially immune |
| **Escape** | Echo-Hounds pursue until target leaves psychic detection range |
| **Distraction** | Forlorn or Undying presence may redirect aggression |

## Summary

The Echo-Hound is a tragedy weaponized—a creature designed to be the perfect silent tracker, transformed by catastrophe into an indiscriminate psychic predator. It does not hunt because it is evil. It hunts because every conscious thought within its range is a scream of agony in its shattered senses, and the only relief it knows is silence.

It is the ghost that hunts the other ghosts of the ruins.

And it hears you thinking.
