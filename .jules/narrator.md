## 2024-05-22 - Post-Glitch Vocabulary Audit
**Challenge:** "Electricity" / "Power" / "Radiation"
**Translation:** "Invisible Fire" / "The Anger of Storms" / "Blight-Heat"
**Why:** Replaced technical terms with ritualistic/animistic metaphors to enforce the "Ignorance is Aesthetic" pillar. Electricity is now treated as a dangerous spirit-force rather than a physical phenomenon.

## 2024-05-22 - Entity Renaming
**Challenge:** "Robot" / "Drone" / "Bot"
**Translation:** "Iron-Walker" / "Spirit" / "Construct"
**Why:** "Robot" implies manufactured servitude. "Iron-Walker" implies a creature made of metal. "Drone" is too modern; "Spirit" or "Hawk" fits the animistic worldview.

## 2024-05-22 - Hazard Description Overhaul
**Challenge:** "Magical Darkness" / "Necrotic Energy"
**Translation:** "Unnatural Shadow" / "Shadow-Sickness"
**Why:** "Magical" is a L1 term that should be rare. "Unnatural" fits the L2 diagnostic/observation layer better while maintaining the mystery. "Necrotic Energy" is too D&D; "Shadow-Sickness" is more visceral.
