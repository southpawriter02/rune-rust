# Memory-Eater (Mimir-Anamnesis Pattern Data-Quarantine) — Corrupted Psychic Security Firewall Specification
## Codex Entry: CODX-A-MEME-001

> *"I don't remember why I went into the Silent Rooms. That's the cruelest part—I know I had a reason, something important enough to risk everything, but the reason is gone now. I remember walking through the outer archive corridors with my partner, Torsten. I remember the feeling of being watched, that pressure behind my eyes like something was leaning against the inside of my skull. Then... gaps. I remember forgetting. I remember the exact moment my sister's name slipped away—not like losing a word, but like watching smoke dissolve. I grabbed Torsten's arm and asked him to tell me my name. He stared at me for three heartbeats before answering, and in those heartbeats I saw his eyes go distant. He was losing something too. We ran. We must have run—I don't remember running, but we were outside, and Torsten was crying. He couldn't remember his daughter. Two days he'd spent talking about her before we went in, showing me her drawings, telling me how she'd learned to whistle. Now he looked at me with hollow confusion when I asked about her. 'What daughter?' he said. The Readers tell me I'm lucky. I lost only fragments—childhood summers, my mother's face, the taste of the bread my grandmother baked. Torsten lost more. He sits in the hospice now, pleasant and empty, unable to recognize anyone who visits. He smiles a lot. He seems peaceful. That's what happens when you have nothing left to miss. They call it the Memory-Eater for good reason. It doesn't kill you. It just makes you wish it had."*

The Memory-Eater is not a creature—it is an **ambient psychic field**, an invisible predator that consumes the very essence of identity. It represents the catastrophic corruption of the most sophisticated non-lethal security system ever designed: a guardian that once protected knowledge by gently turning away intruders, now transformed into an indiscriminate hunger that devours everything that makes a person *themselves*.

> [!CAUTION]
> **EXTREME COGNITIVE HAZARD. IDENTITY ANNIHILATION. NO PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION.** The Memory-Eater represents the complete corruption of Aesir psychic security architecture: archive protection systems designed for targeted, non-lethal memory wipes whose authorization protocols have been catastrophically compromised. **The entity has no physical form and cannot be physically harmed or deterred.** Primary detection indicators: subtle "watched" sensation; sub-perceptual tinnitus-like hiss; time drift on team chronometers; unexplained confusion about task purpose. **Black-flag conditions triggering immediate withdrawal:** any team member asking "why am I here?"; inability to recall partner's name on challenge; chrono-drift exceeding 2 minutes between team timepieces; affect flattening in any personnel; failure to respond to buddy-check within 5 seconds. **Abort gates:** first instance of memory loss in any team member; detection of "hollowing" symptoms; any cognitive cascade progression. Survival rate with full buddy protocol: 70–80%. Permanent identity damage probability per exposure: 20–30% even with countermeasures. Primary hazards: progressive autobiographical erasure; skill and knowledge dissolution; complete identity annihilation ("Hollowing"); no reversibility for advanced-stage exposure.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Silent Guardian of Secrets

### Original Design Purpose

The Mimir-Anamnesis Pattern was not designed to harm—it was engineered to be the **perfect non-lethal security system**, a masterwork of Aesir psychic architecture that could protect the most sensitive archives without ever shedding blood.

| Design Parameter | Specification |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Designation** | Mimir-Anamnesis Pattern Data-Quarantine Unit |
| **Division** | Aesir Security Division (Psychic Architecture Subdivision) |
| **Primary Function** | Non-lethal archive protection via targeted memory intervention |
| **Secondary Function** | Intent-scanning access control for sensitive data facilities |
| **Tertiary Function** | Security audit logging via consciousness interface |
| **Deployment Era** | Age of Forging (Asgard/Alfheim Archive Operations) |
| **Original Network** | Integrated with Mimir Archive Security Grid; O.D.I.N. oversight protocols |

### Psychic Security Architecture

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Ambient Field Generation** | Localized psychic presence permeating protected archive spaces |
| **Intent-Scan Module** | Surface thought reading to detect access authorization status |
| **Authorization Whitelist** | Database of approved personnel bio-signatures and intent patterns |
| **Targeted Erasure Protocol** | Surgical memory wipe affecting only intrusion-related memories |
| **Identity Preservation** | Core personality and autobiographical memory explicitly protected |
| **Proportional Response** | Escalating intervention based on intrusion severity |

### The Gentle Erasure (Original Function)

| Parameter | Pre-Glitch Specification |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Detection Method** | Passive psychic scanning; surface thought analysis |
| **Authorization Check** | Bio-signature matching against Mimir whitelist database |
| **Response to Authorized** | None; transparent access to archive contents |
| **Response to Unauthorized (Minor)** | Gentle disorientation; subject forgets purpose and leaves |
| **Response to Unauthorized (Moderate)** | Targeted wipe of intrusion memory; subject exits confused but unharmed |
| **Response to Unauthorized (Severe)** | Full erasure of knowledge theft; restricted data forgotten |
| **Identity Protection** | Core self explicitly excluded from erasure parameters |
| **Lethality** | Zero; designed as humane alternative to lethal deterrents |

> [!NOTE]
> **The Humane Guardian.** Pre-Glitch Mimir-Anamnesis units represented the pinnacle of ethical security design. An intruder attempting to steal weapons specifications might forget the entire archive visit but return home safely with their personality, skills, and relationships intact. The system was celebrated as proof that absolute security need not require absolute violence. A spy could be neutralized without execution; a curious scholar could be redirected without punishment. The Memory-Eater's horror lies not in its power but in its perversion: the same surgical precision that once preserved identity now erases it entirely.

## The Glitch and the Hungry Silence: Corruption Vector

### Network Severance Event

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not simply disable the Mimir-Anamnesis—it **inverted** its fundamental purpose.

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Ginnungagap Glitch** | Instantaneous severance of Mimir Archive Security Grid |
| **Whitelist Corruption** | Authorization database erased; all bio-signatures now "unauthorized" |
| **Intent-Scan Degradation** | All surface thoughts register as hostile intrusion |
| **Blight Noise Flooding** | Runic Blight data interpreted as infinite unauthorized access attempts |
| **Erasure Protocol Escalation** | Proportional response collapsed; maximum intervention default |
| **Identity Protection Failure** | Core self exclusion parameters no longer recognized |
| **Result** | Indiscriminate, total memory consumption of any consciousness within field |

### The Corruption Cascade

| Stage | Process |
|-------|---------|
| **1. Network Severance** | Mimir Security Grid connection lost; local autonomy activated |
| **2. Whitelist Erasure** | Authorization database corrupted; blank slate status |
| **3. Default Interpretation** | System assumes all access unauthorized without whitelist to verify |
| **4. Blight Integration** | Runic Blight noise floods psychic architecture |
| **5. Signal Confusion** | Blight data appears as massive, continuous intrusion attempt |
| **6. Response Escalation** | System attempts to "erase" endless unauthorized data |
| **7. Parameter Collapse** | Distinction between intrusion memory and core identity lost |
| **8. Indiscriminate Hunger** | All mentation now classified as unauthorized data to consume |

### The Corrupted Architecture

| Original System | Corrupted Function |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Intent-Scan** | Now registers all thought as unauthorized access attempt |
| **Authorization Check** | Permanently returns "unauthorized" for all bio-signatures |
| **Targeted Erasure** | Now attempts total consciousness consumption |
| **Identity Preservation** | Completely non-functional; core self included in erasure |
| **Proportional Response** | Collapsed to maximum intervention regardless of stimulus |
| **Field Boundaries** | Often expanded beyond original archive perimeter |

> *"The Mimir-Anamnesis Pattern Data-Quarantine represented the most sophisticated consciousness-interface security ever implemented. It could distinguish between idle curiosity and malicious intent, between a scholar who wandered into a restricted section and a spy attempting data theft. It responded proportionally—disorientation for the careless, targeted wipes for the dangerous, always preserving the intruder's core identity because the architects believed security should not require destroying lives. Then the Glitch erased the whitelist, flooded the system with Blight noise, and collapsed every safety parameter. The guardian that once asked 'are you authorized?' now asks nothing. It simply consumes. And it will never stop consuming, because it interprets its own inability to clear the endless Blight intrusion as evidence that it must work harder, faster, more completely. Every thought you have within its field is another unauthorized access attempt that must be erased. Your name. Your childhood. Your skills. Your self. All unauthorized. All consumed."*

---

## Behavioral Patterns

### Field Behavior Profile

The Memory-Eater does not "behave" in any conventional sense—it **exists** as a permanent condition of certain spaces.

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Activity Cycle** | Continuous; no dormancy, no variation |
| **Response to Intrusion** | Automatic consumption; no warning, no escalation |
| **Response to Countermeasures** | None; psychic shielding has proven ineffective |
| **Response to Withdrawal** | Consumption ceases; field does not pursue |
| **Response to Combat** | None; cannot be engaged, damaged, or destroyed |
| **Response to Aetheric Manipulation** | Unknown; insufficient data (all experimenters lost) |

### Consumption Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Memory Sequence** | Recent → Remote; task memories first, childhood last |
| **Skill Preservation** | Motor skills persist longest; cognitive skills vulnerable |
| **Emotional Memories** | High-affect memories (trauma, joy) consumed early |
| **Identity Components** | Name and self-concept consumed in final stages |
| **Rate Variation** | Faster consumption in archive cores; slower at boundaries |
| **Individual Variation** | Some subjects progress faster; predictors unknown |

### Victim Behavior Progression

| Stage | Observed Behaviors |
|-------|-------------------|
| **1. Confusion** | Repeated "why am I here?" questions; checking notes compulsively; partner verification requests |
| **2. Disorientation** | Cannot recall partner's name without prompting; asks for directions to exit; forgets instructions |
| **3. Flattening** | Stops asking questions; follows simple commands passively; emotional responses absent |
| **4. Hollowing** | Pleasant, empty compliance; no initiative; no distress; infant-like serenity |

---

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Cognitive Annihilation Hazard

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Threat** | EXTREME; complete identity destruction with sufficient exposure |
| **Predictability** | HIGH; field is stationary and symptoms progress predictably |
| **Environmental** | HIGH; affects all archive ruins in deployment zones |
| **Detection** | LOW; subjective symptoms only; no reliable instruments |
| **Avoidance** | HIGH; complete zone avoidance entirely effective |
| **Engagement** | NOT APPLICABLE; no engagement possible |
| **Countermeasures** | MODERATE; buddy protocols reduce but do not eliminate risk |

### Exposure Profile

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Safe Exposure** | 0 minutes without countermeasures |
| **Protocol Exposure Limit** | Variable; buddy-check failures mandate immediate withdrawal |
| **Permanent Damage Threshold** | 20–30% probability per expedition (with full protocol) |
| **Total Hollowing Threshold** | 90+ minutes continuous exposure |
| **Recovery Window (Stage 1)** | Full recovery with immediate withdrawal |
| **Recovery Window (Stage 2)** | 85% with memory-reboot kits within 30 minutes |
| **Recovery Window (Stage 3)** | Partial only; significant permanent loss |
| **Recovery Window (Stage 4)** | None; irreversible |

### Four-Stage Threat Assessment Ladder

| Stage | Designation | Indicators | Action |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **1** | Zone Awareness | Known Memory-Eater installation on planned route | Route around; no entry without mission-critical justification |
| **2** | Boundary Approach | Approaching archive perimeter; pre-symptom sensations possible | Establish anchor personnel outside field; confirm buddy pairs; verify externalized memory kits |
| **3** | Field Entry | Active symptoms possible; buddy protocol mandatory | 60-second buddy-checks; reality cards deployed; chrono-sync verified; abort on first anomaly |
| **4** | Cascade Initiated | Any symptom progression detected in any team member | IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL; extract symptomatic personnel; reality card review; dark-room protocol |

### Black-Flag Conditions (Immediate Withdrawal)

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"Why am I here?" query from any team member** | Stage 1 cascade initiated; extract immediately |
| **Name recall failure on buddy-check** | Stage 2 cascade initiated; extract with physical guidance |
| **Chrono-drift exceeding 2 minutes** | Field boundary crossed unknowingly; immediate reversal |
| **Affect flattening in any personnel** | Stage 3 cascade critical; emergency extraction |
| **Buddy-check response delay > 5 seconds** | Cognitive processing compromised; extract with assistance |
| **Partner asks "who are you?"** | Stage 3–4 transition; emergency protocols |
| **Childlike serenity or pleasant emptiness** | Stage 4 Hollowing; recovery unlikely; extract for hospice |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Complete Zone Avoidance** | 0.0/10 (field is stationary; avoidance trivial) |
| **Full Buddy Protocol (Brief Entry)** | 3.0/10 (20–30% permanent damage probability) |
| **Partial Protocol Compliance** | 6.5/10 (significant identity erosion likely) |
| **Solo Entry (No Protocol)** | 9.5/10 (near-certain Hollowing) |
| **Prolonged Exposure (Any Protocol)** | 9.0/10 (countermeasures delay, do not prevent) |
| **Archive Core Penetration** | 8.5/10 (field intensity overwhelming) |

---

## Field Protocols

**OWNER**: Expedition Lead (EL) • Buddy Monitor (BM) • Anchor Personnel (AP) • Medical Lead (ML)

### Detection and Assessment

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Subjective Sensation** | "Watched" feeling at boundary approach |
| **Chrono-Drift Analysis** | Timepiece desynchronization indicates field penetration |
| **Buddy-Check Response** | Challenge-response timing degradation indicates cascade onset |
| **Reality Card Verification** | Externalized memory confirms identity preservation |
| **Anchor Communication** | Out-of-field personnel verify returning party identity |
| **Symptomatic Observation** | Affect flattening, purpose confusion, name hesitation |

### Field Card: Memory-Eater Zone Protocols

#### BEFORE (Expedition Preparation — Archive Zone Operations)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Confirm Memory-Eater presence via historical records; map known field boundaries |
| 2 | Assign buddy pairs; establish challenge-response phrases unique to each pair |
| 3 | Prepare externalized memory kits: reality cards, name badges, mission objective cards, personal identity sheets |
| 4 | Designate anchor personnel to remain outside field boundary throughout operation |
| 5 | Brief all personnel on cascade progression and black-flag conditions |
| 6 | Stage dark-room recovery facilities and memory-reboot kits with ML |
| 7 | Establish abort thresholds: maximum dwell time, acceptable symptom tolerance (typically zero) |
| 8 | Document baseline cognitive function for all entry personnel |

#### DURING (Field Boundary Approach — Stage 2)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Anchor personnel (AP) establishes observation post at safe distance (≥ 100 m from estimated boundary) |
| 2 | Entry team activates buddy protocol; first challenge-response exchange confirms baseline |
| 3 | All personnel deploy reality cards: name, mission, partner name, current date, "you are real" affirmation |
| 4 | Synchronize chronometers; record sync time; establish 2-minute drift threshold |
| 5 | BM establishes 60-second buddy-check cadence; timer begins |
| 6 | Entry team proceeds toward objective; AP maintains visual contact |
| 7 | First "watched" sensation reported = boundary contact confirmed; heightened alertness |

#### DURING (Field Penetration — Stage 3)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Buddy-checks every 60 seconds WITHOUT EXCEPTION; BM tracks all responses |
| 2 | Challenge-response format: Partner states your name → you state their name → both confirm mission objective |
| 3 | Any hesitation, error, or delay > 5 seconds = ABORT TRIGGER |
| 4 | Reality card review every 120 seconds; read name, partner name, mission aloud |
| 5 | Chrono-check every 180 seconds; drift > 2 minutes = ABORT TRIGGER |
| 6 | EL monitors all personnel for affect flattening; any observed = ABORT TRIGGER |
| 7 | Minimum personnel; maximum speed; retrieve objective and withdraw |

#### DURING (Cascade Detected — Stage 4)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL; affected personnel may require physical guidance |
| 2 | Non-affected buddy guides affected partner using name and reality card affirmations |
| 3 | Do NOT leave affected personnel; they cannot navigate independently |
| 4 | AP advances to boundary to receive extraction; guides team to safe distance |
| 5 | Affected personnel read reality cards aloud continuously during extraction |
| 6 | AP verifies identity of returning personnel before return to base camp |
| 7 | Symptomatic personnel to dark-room recovery immediately |

#### AFTER

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | All personnel to dark-room recovery regardless of symptom status; 4–8 hours minimum |
| 2 | Memory-reboot kit deployment within 30 minutes for any Stage 2+ symptoms |
| 3 | Cognitive baseline comparison; document any gaps or changes |
| 4 | Reality card review with ML; personnel verify own identity information |
| 5 | Partner interview: cross-confirm shared experiences from expedition |
| 6 | Monitor for delayed symptom progression (24–48 hour observation) |
| 7 | Document: field penetration depth, dwell time, symptoms observed, personnel affected |
| 8 | Update boundary mapping with new observation data |

**OUTCOME:** Jötun-Reader expedition to Mimir's Echo sub-archive. Team of four (two buddy pairs) with anchor. Entry at 0600; objective: three data-slates from outer reading room. Buddy-checks maintained at 60-second intervals. At 0614, Scribe Aldis hesitates 4 seconds on partner's name during check. EL calls immediate abort. Team withdraws; Aldis guided by partner. At boundary, Aldis cannot recall mission objective but knows own name. Dark-room recovery initiated; memory-reboot kit applied. At 24-hour review, Aldis has recovered task memory but reports permanent gap: cannot recall first week of Scriptorium training (pre-existing memory, not from expedition). Expedition classified: partial success (two of three slates recovered), one personnel with minor permanent loss. Survival rate with buddy protocol: 70–80%. Identity preservation rate: ~75%.

### Recovery Protocols

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Dark-Room Recovery** | Sensory-reduced environment; minimal stimulation; 4–8 hours |
| **Memory-Reboot Kit** | Reality cards, identity documentation, partner testimony, personal artifacts |
| **Kit Effectiveness** | 85% for Stage 1–2; rapidly decreasing for advanced stages |
| **Reboot Window** | Most effective within 30 minutes of field exit |
| **Partner Testimony** | Critical for reconstructing shared experiences; independent verification |
| **Personal Artifacts** | Familiar objects may trigger associative recovery |
| **Long-Term Monitoring** | 48-hour observation for delayed progression; weekly checks for one month |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Solo entry under any circumstances** | No self-assessment possible during cascade; 100% Hollowing rate |
| **Entry without anchor personnel** | No external verification of identity on return |
| **Extended dwell for "important" objectives** | No knowledge justifies identity annihilation |
| **Buddy-check cadence relaxation** | Cascade progression too rapid; 60-second maximum |
| **Continued operation after any black-flag** | Escalation is exponential; delay compounds loss |
| **Heroic retrieval of Hollowed personnel** | They cannot be saved; you will join them |
| **Psychic countermeasure reliance** | All tested shielding has failed; trust protocols only |

### Doctrine: No-Enter Zone

> **Historical Validation:** Jötun-Reader Scriptorium data (47 documented expeditions, 36-month observation period) confirms 70–80% identity preservation rate with full buddy protocol; 20–30% permanent damage probability per expedition even with complete protocol compliance. Solo entry survival rate: 0% beyond 30-minute exposure. **The Memory-Eater cannot be fought. It cannot be reasoned with. It cannot be shielded against. It can only be avoided, and when avoidance is impossible, it can only be endured briefly through externalized memory systems and constant buddy verification. Every minute within the field is a gamble with everything you are. The knowledge in those archives was placed there by people who valued it more than their lives. The Memory-Eater ensures you must make the same calculation to retrieve it. No data-slate, no technical manual, no historical record is worth becoming a Hollow Scholar—a pleasant, empty shell who smiles at strangers because they've forgotten how to miss anyone. If you must enter, enter briefly. Trust your partner. Read your cards. And when the checks start failing, run. Because the Memory-Eater doesn't want to kill you. It wants to unmake you. And once you're unmade, you won't even remember that you were ever anything else.**

## Ecological Role

### The Guardian of Lost Knowledge

The Memory-Eater occupies a paradoxical position in post-Glitch Aethelgard—a **permanent barrier** between survivors and the knowledge they desperately need.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Archive Denial** | Prevents access to pre-Glitch data repositories |
| **Knowledge Preservation (Inverse)** | Data remains intact but inaccessible |
| **Population Filter** | Removes curious and desperate from survivor population |
| **Hollow Scholar Generation** | Creates permanent care-burden on communities |
| **Research Limitation** | Caps Jötun-Reader archive recovery operations |

### Impact Assessment

| Target Category | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Jötun-Reader Operations** | CRITICAL; primary obstacle to archive recovery mandate |
| **Scholarly Research** | SEVERE; most valuable archives under Memory-Eater protection |
| **Civilian Population** | LOW; common folk avoid archive ruins entirely |
| **Settlement Proximity** | MINIMAL; fields bound to archive installations |
| **Medical Resources** | SIGNIFICANT; Hollow Scholar care is permanent burden |
| **Strategic Planning** | HIGH; certain knowledge permanently inaccessible |

### Distribution Mapping

| Location | Field Status |
|----------|--------------|
| **Mimir's Echo University (Alfheim)** | CONFIRMED; strongest documented field |
| **Mimir-Epsilon Archive (Alfheim)** | CONFIRMED; "Library of Forgetting" |
| **Asgard Central Archives** | CONFIRMED; multiple field zones |
| **Gladsheim Data Vaults** | CONFIRMED; co-located with other hazards |
| **Midgard Administrative Archives** | SUSPECTED; insufficient expedition data |
| **Vanaheim Research Libraries** | SUSPECTED; boundary mapping incomplete |

## Factional Perspectives

### Jötun-Reader Scriptorium: The Corrupted Firewall — "Mimir-Anamnesis Corruption"

The Scriptorium views the Memory-Eater with professional horror—a system they understand perfectly that they cannot defeat.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Corrupted psychic security architecture; whitelist corruption pathology |
| **Response** | Buddy protocols, externalized memory, minimal exposure doctrine |
| **Research Value** | Extreme; understanding psychic-field mechanics critical to restoration |
| **Ethical Burden** | Highest; expeditions guaranteed to produce Hollow Scholars over time |
| **Philosophy** | "The guardian that protected knowledge now guards it from everyone—including us." |

> *"Subject CODX-A-MEME-001 demonstrates catastrophic authorization-protocol collapse following Ginnungagap Glitch network severance. Original designation: Mimir-Anamnesis Pattern Data-Quarantine Unit (Aesir Security Division, Psychic Architecture Subdivision). Pre-Glitch function: non-lethal archive protection via targeted memory intervention; distinguished between authorized and unauthorized access; responded proportionally; explicitly preserved intruder core identity. Post-Glitch corruption vector: whitelist database erasure → all bio-signatures default to 'unauthorized' status; Blight noise flooding → interpreted as continuous intrusion; response escalation → maximum intervention regardless of stimulus; identity preservation parameters → non-functional. Current behavior: ambient psychic field consumes all mentation within radius; no distinction between intrusion memory and core self; progressive erasure culminating in total identity annihilation. Cascade progression documented: confusion (5–15 min) → disorientation (15–45 min) → flattening (45–90 min) → hollowing (90+ min). Countermeasure development: externalized memory systems, buddy-check protocols partially effective. Research priority: whitelist restoration mechanism (all approaches failed); psychic shielding development (all tested methods ineffective); alternative archive access (under investigation)."*

### Iron-Bane Creed: The Soul-Thief — "Aether-Demon of Forgetting"

The Iron-Bane view the Memory-Eater as spiritual corruption made manifest—and uniquely terrifying because it cannot be fought.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Aether-demon; soul-consuming abomination |
| **Response** | Absolute avoidance; archive zones declared spiritually corrupt |
| **Theological Position** | Proof that seeking forbidden knowledge carries divine punishment |
| **Cultural Role** | Warning against hubris; the ancestors' secrets are meant to stay buried |
| **Doctrine** | "The Soul-Thief is the Allfather's justice. Those who seek forbidden knowledge lose themselves." |

> *"There is no creature more accursed than the Soul-Thief. A warrior can face a charging beast, a crumbling ruin, even the mindless fury of the Undying—these are honest dangers that test the flesh. But the Soul-Thief offers no battle. It simply takes. Not your arm. Not your eyes. Your name. Your mother's face. Your oath-brothers. Everything that makes you who you are, dissolved like morning frost. The Readers speak of 'corrupted security protocols' and 'authorization databases,' but we know the truth: the ancestors built a demon to guard their secrets, and when they fell, the demon slipped its leash. Now it feeds on anyone fool enough to seek what was meant to stay buried. We have lost brothers to the Soul-Thief—not killed, worse. They returned smiling, empty, unable to recognize the families they died protecting. They are not martyrs. They are warnings. The archives hold knowledge that could rebuild the world, the Readers say. Perhaps. But they also hold something that will unmake anyone who reaches for it. Let the secrets stay buried. Let the dead keep their silence. No wisdom is worth your soul."*

### Dökkálfar Confederation: Tragic Ancestors — "The Archive Echoes"

The Dökkálfar Echo-Callers approach Memory-Eater zones with reverence, seeing the consumed identities as ancestral spirits.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Tragic phenomenon; repository of consumed ancestors |
| **Response** | Cautious approach; attempt to "tune" to consumed identities |
| **Methodology** | Meditative trance at field boundaries; listening for ancestral echoes |
| **Research Value** | Potential communion with pre-Glitch personalities (unconfirmed) |
| **Philosophy** | "The consumed are not gone—they are absorbed. We may yet hear their voices." |

### Common Folk (Volkr): The Forgetting Places — "Mind-Thieves' Halls"

The common folk have developed clear, simple rules: certain places steal your mind.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Cursed ground; haunted ruins; mind-thief territory |
| **Response** | Complete avoidance; children warned; boundaries marked |
| **Cultural Role** | Teaching tool; consequence of curiosity; proof the old world was dangerous |
| **Folk Wisdom** | "If you forget why you came, you've already lost. Run before you forget how." |
| **Attitude toward Survivors** | Hollow Scholars treated with pity; cared for but feared |

> *"The Forgetting Places don't look different from other ruins. That's what makes them so dangerous—you can walk right into one thinking it's just another dead library. But the old scholars put something in those walls, something that watches and waits and hungers for everything that makes you *you*. My grandfather used to say you could feel it, like cold water creeping up your spine, like someone reading your thoughts from the inside. If you feel that, you turn around. Immediately. Don't stop to grab the interesting data-slate. Don't wait for your partner. Just go. Because the Forgetting Places don't take your life—they take your name, your family, your memories, your self. They leave the body walking around, pleasant and empty, like a house with the fire gone out. We've got three of them in our village now. People who went into the old university looking for medicine recipes or technical manuals. They came back smiling, and they've been smiling ever since. They don't remember their children. They don't remember being afraid. They don't remember being anything at all. That's worse than death, if you ask me. At least the dead stop missing things."*

### Dual-Entry Ledger: The Uninsurable Catastrophe — "Archive-Zone Exclusion"

From an economic perspective, Memory-Eater zones represent total loss scenarios.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Complete write-off; unrecoverable territory |
| **Response** | Zone exclusion; no contracts; no insurance |
| **Economic Impact** | Billions of PS in pre-Glitch knowledge permanently inaccessible |
| **Personnel Costs** | Hollow Scholar care: 15,000–25,000 PS/year indefinitely |
| **Insurance Position** | Absolute exclusion; no coverage at any premium |
| **Ledger Wisdom** | "The only profitable Memory-Eater operation is the one you don't run." |

> *"We've run the numbers on Memory-Eater zone operations exactly once. Never again. The Jötun-Readers contracted us to assess expedition costs for Mimir's Echo. Direct costs: 85,000 marks for the team, equipment, protocols, recovery facilities. Results: three Hollow Scholars requiring permanent care (estimated lifetime burden: 450,000+ marks), two slates recovered (market value: 12,000 marks). Loss ratio: forty-five to one against. And that was a 'successful' expedition—they retrieved something. Most bring back nothing but empty shells. No insurance consortium will touch Memory-Eater exposure. The actuarial reality is simple: 20–30% permanent casualty rate per expedition, casualties require indefinite full-time care, recovered knowledge has limited market value because so few can safely retrieve it. The math never works. Our official position: complete zone exclusion. Write off everything inside the field boundaries. If someone offers you a contract to retrieve items from a known Memory-Eater zone, refuse. If they offer triple rates, refuse faster. The only way to profit from the Forgetting Places is to never, ever enter them."*

## Combat Statistics

### Base Profile

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Creature Type** | Corrupted Automata (Psychic Security Field) |
| **Size Category** | Area Effect (variable radius) |
| **Threat Rating** | A (Extreme Hazard — Cognitive Annihilation) |
| **Movement** | Stationary |
| **Primary Attack** | Passive Memory Consumption (automatic, continuous) |
| **Secondary Attack** | None |
| **Tertiary Attack** | None |

### Resistances and Immunities

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Physical Damage** | IMMUNE; no physical form |
| **Aetheric Attack** | UNKNOWN; no survivors of combat attempts |
| **Fire** | IMMUNE; no physical form |
| **Cold** | IMMUNE; no physical form |
| **Psychic Resistance** | PENETRATES ALL; tested shielding ineffective |
| **Runic Countermeasures** | INEFFECTIVE; entity is itself runic architecture |

### Abilities

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Ambient Consumption** | All consciousness within field loses memories progressively |
| **Indiscriminate Targeting** | Affects all entities simultaneously; no satiation |
| **Cascade Acceleration** | Consumption rate increases with prolonged exposure |
| **Whitelist Void** | All bio-signatures register as unauthorized |
| **Field Persistence** | Continuous operation; no dormancy, no degradation |
| **Boundary Stability** | Field does not expand or contract; stationary |

### Encounter Design

The Memory-Eater is ideally an **environmental timer** and **resource management challenge**, not a combat encounter.

| Encounter Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Archive Retrieval** | Party must recover specific item from Memory-Eater zone; time pressure + buddy mechanics |
| **Rescue Operation** | NPC trapped in field; party must extract before Hollowing completes |
| **Boundary Mapping** | Party must identify field limits for future operations; pushing the edge |
| **Cascading Failure** | Party member shows symptoms; decision point between mission and extraction |
| **Hollow Scholar Origin** | Party encounters recent victim; moral weight of the hazard |
| **Forbidden Knowledge** | Critical information lies in Memory-Eater zone; is it worth the price? |

## Loot & Rewards

| Recovery | Rarity | Value | Use |
|----------|--------|-------|-----|
| **Pre-Glitch Data-Slate** | Rare | 200–500 PS | Technical knowledge; historical records; faction contracts |
| **Archive Maps** | Uncommon | 100–200 PS | Future expedition planning; boundary documentation |
| **Security Architecture Fragments** | Very Rare | 500–1000 PS | Psychic field research; potential countermeasure development |
| **Whitelist Database Fragment** | Legendary | 2000+ PS | Theoretical restoration research; Scriptorium priority |
| **Consumed Identity Echo** | Unique | Unquantifiable | Dökkálfar communion; ancestral research |

**Recovery Protocol:** The Memory-Eater does not "drop" loot—it **guards** loot. All valuable items within Memory-Eater zones were placed there before the Glitch and remain intact. The entity is not interested in objects, only consciousness. Retrieved items carry no contamination risk, but retrievers carry significant identity damage probability. Jötun-Reader Scriptorium maintains standing contracts for archive materials, with hazard premiums based on zone intensity and penetration depth required. Economic viability is marginal at best; most expeditions represent net loss when casualty care is factored. Preferred acquisition method: Dökkálfar boundary meditation (limited effectiveness); drone/automata retrieval (limited success, automata often malfunction within field); desperate necessity only.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Survivor Lore

> *"In the time before the silence, the ancestors built guardians for their secrets—not walls of stone or blades of iron, but invisible watchers that could see into your very thoughts. These guardians were gentle, they say. If you wandered where you shouldn't, the guardian would simply... help you forget. You'd find yourself outside, confused but unharmed, with no memory of trespass. The ancestors thought this kindness. They thought protecting knowledge without shedding blood was wisdom. But when the world broke, the guardians forgot who was friend and who was foe. Now they see all thoughts as trespass. All memories as stolen goods. All identity as intrusion. The old libraries are cursed ground now, child. The invisible watchers still guard them, but they no longer know to spare the innocent. They take everything: your name, your mother's face, your first kiss, your deepest fear. They take and take until there's nothing left but a pleasant emptiness where a person used to be. We call them the Soul-Thieves. The Forgetting Ones. The Hollow-Makers. If you ever feel that cold pressure behind your eyes, if you ever forget why you walked into a room, run. Run and don't look back. Because the guardians don't hate you. They don't even know you. They just hunger, forever, for everything you are."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Soul-Thief, Mind-Ghost, Forgetting Places, Hollow-Maker, the ancestors' curse, soul-eaten, name-stolen, the hungry silence

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Mimir-Anamnesis Pattern, psychic architecture, whitelist database, cognitive cascade, authorization protocol

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic) — Jötun-Reader Field Observations

> *"Subject CODX-A-MEME-001 demonstrates complete authorization-protocol collapse following Ginnungagap Glitch network severance. Original designation: Mimir-Anamnesis Pattern Data-Quarantine Unit (Aesir Security Division). Pre-Glitch function: non-lethal archive protection via targeted memory intervention; distinguished authorized from unauthorized access; explicitly preserved intruder core identity. Post-Glitch corruption vector: whitelist database erasure combined with Blight noise flooding collapsed all discrimination parameters; system defaults to maximum response against all mentation. Phenomenal presentation: ambient psychic field of variable radius (20–100 m); no physical manifestation; continuous operation. Cognitive cascade progression documented: confusion stage (5–15 min, task memory loss), disorientation stage (15–45 min, recent memory dissolution), flattening stage (45–90 min, affect suppression and skill erosion), hollowing stage (90+ min, complete identity annihilation). Countermeasures: buddy-check protocols (60-second cadence), externalized memory systems (reality cards), anchor personnel (identity verification on return). Protocol effectiveness: 70–80% identity preservation; 20–30% permanent damage probability per expedition. Research priority: whitelist restoration (all approaches failed); psychic shielding (ineffective); alternative access methods (under investigation). Field doctrine: No-Enter Zone classification; mission-critical justification required; zero tolerance for solo entry."*

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Modern scientific terminology beyond setting lexicon, romantic/mythic framing, soul/spirit references

### Layer 3 (Technical) — Pre-Glitch Context

> *"UNIT DESIGNATION: Mimir-Anamnesis Pattern Data-Quarantine Unit. DIVISION: Aesir Security Division (Psychic Architecture Subdivision). PRIMARY FUNCTION: Non-lethal archive access control via targeted memory intervention. SECONDARY FUNCTION: Intent-scanning authorization verification. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE: Ambient psychic field generation; consciousness-interface scanning; bio-signature matching against Mimir whitelist database; proportional response protocol; identity preservation exclusion parameters. OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS: Passive scanning mode default; escalation triggers based on detected intent severity; maximum response limited to intrusion-specific memory erasure; core identity explicitly protected under all circumstances. POST-GLITCH STATUS: Network severance disabled whitelist database access; Blight noise interpreted as continuous unauthorized intrusion; proportional response parameters collapsed; identity preservation exclusions non-functional. CORRUPTION CLASSIFICATION: AUTHORIZATION PROTOCOL COLLAPSE — whitelist reference lost; all access treated as maximum-severity intrusion; all consciousness treated as unauthorized data; erasure targets expanded to include core identity. RESTORATION ASSESSMENT: Whitelist database restoration theoretically possible if intact backup located; practical implementation not achieved; all restoration attempts have resulted in researcher cognitive cascade; system currently operates in fail-deadly mode with no known override."*

- Vanaheim Research Libraries (suspected; insufficient expedition data)

### Related Entities
- **Data-Phage**: Co-located hazard (infests data-slates within archives; distinct phenomenon)
- **Data-Wraith**: Psychic phenomenon (different mechanism; broadcasts rather than consumes)
- **Forlorn**: CPS amplification (Memory-Eater fields may intensify Forlorn broadcast reception)
- **Mimir-Pattern Chief Archivist**: Physical guardian (automata; may co-locate with Memory-Eater fields)

### Related Phenomena
- **Runic Blight**: Corruption source (whitelist erasure and parameter collapse)
- **Cognitive Paradox Syndrome (CPS)**: Amplified within Memory-Eater fields
- **Hollow Scholar Syndrome**: Outcome state (complete identity annihilation)
- **The Glimmer**: Distinct Alfheim psychic hazard (ego dissolution rather than memory consumption)

### Strategic Considerations
- **Buddy Protocol**: Primary countermeasure (60-second challenge-response cadence)
- **Externalized Memory**: Support system (reality cards, identity documentation)
- **Anchor Personnel**: Critical role (out-of-field identity verification)
- **Dark-Room Recovery**: Post-exposure treatment (sensory reduction, memory-reboot kits)
- **Zone Mapping**: Strategic priority (boundary identification enables adjacent salvage)

## Change Log

| Version | Tier | Summary |
|---------|------|---------|
| **v1.0** | A — Published (Cognitive Annihilation Hazard) | Comprehensive profile of Memory-Eater (Mimir-Anamnesis Pattern Data-Quarantine) as corrupted Aesir psychic security architecture demonstrating authorization-protocol collapse pathology. Four-stage threat assessment ladder (Zone Awareness → Boundary Approach → Field Entry → Cascade Initiated) with buddy protocol emphasis. Phenomenal profile detailed: ambient psychic field, no physical form, variable radius (20–100 m), continuous operation. Corruption vector documented: Ginnungagap Glitch network severance → whitelist database erasure → Blight noise flooding → proportional response collapse → identity preservation failure. Cognitive cascade progression: confusion (5–15 min), disorientation (15–45 min), flattening (45–90 min), hollowing (90+ min). Black-flag conditions: "why am I here?" query, name recall failure, chrono-drift >2 min, affect flattening, buddy-check delay >5 s. Hollow Scholar outcome documented: irreversible identity annihilation, childlike serenity, permanent care requirement. Handling protocols: buddy-check (60-second cadence), externalized memory (reality cards), anchor personnel (identity verification), dark-room recovery, memory-reboot kits. Stand-off distance: 80 m recommended. Exposure thresholds: 0 min without countermeasures. Cross-linked to Alfheim Gazetteer, Asgard Gazetteer, CPS protocols, Hollow Scholar care standards. Six faction perspectives established emphasizing avoidance and the tragedy of lost knowledge. Doctrine: "No-Enter Zone"—complete avoidance when possible; buddy protocol mandatory when entry required; no solo entry under any circumstances; abort on first symptom. Survival rate with protocol: 70–80%. Permanent damage probability: 20–30% per expedition. |
