# The Age of Creeds — The Cold War of Souls
## Archives Entry: AAM-HIST-CRDS-001

> *"We arrived at Crossroads during the Festival of Embers—the one week each year when all three Creeds agree to lower their weapons and their voices. The market square was packed: Jötun-Readers in their grey robes, heads bent over data-slates; Iron-Banes in their soot-stained forge-aprons, eyes scanning the crowd for 'corruption'; God-Sleepers in their pilgrimage whites, singing hymns to the slumbering giants. I watched a Reader and a Bane share a meal at the same table—not speaking, not looking at each other, but not killing each other either. That is what passes for peace in the Age of Creeds. Three irreconcilable answers to the same unanswerable question: 'Why did the world fall, and what is our place in this new order?' The Readers say the answer is in the archives. The Banes say the answer is in the flames. The Sleepers say the answer is in the silence of the sleeping gods. Seven centuries after the Glitch, we have stopped fighting for survival. Now we fight for meaning. I am not certain this is an improvement."*

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Era Designation** | Age of Creeds (Post-Glitch Era IV) |
| **Temporal Span** | Year 518 PG – Year 783 PG (ongoing) |
| **Duration** | ~265 years (current era; no termination event) |
| **Alternate Names** | The Cold War of Souls, The Age of Questions, The Ideological Era |
| **Preceding Era** | Age of Walls (287–518 PG) |
| **Succeeding Era** | None (current era) |
| **Defining Phenomenon** | Ideological consolidation; belief infrastructure; creedal cold war |
| **Societal State** | Stable settlement; factional competition; doctrine as governance |
| **Document Layer** | Layer 4 (Omniscient Ground Truth) |
| **Author Faction** | Aethelgard Archives Master, Office of the Master Archivist |
| **Classification** | AETHELGARD-ARCHIVES-MASTER // HISTORICAL NARRATIVE |
| **Doctrine** | This document represents the "true" technical and historical record that Layer 1–3 perspectives partially perceive, interpret, or distort |

The Age of Creeds is not a recovery from catastrophe. It is the discovery that survival is not enough—that humanity, having learned to live in the corpse of a dead god, must now decide what that life means.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **THE GREAT AUTOPSY: CHRONIC PHASE.** If the Age of Forging represents the disease itself, the Age of Silence its acute symptomatic phase, and the Ages of Wandering and Walls its convalescence, the Age of Creeds represents the **chronic phase**—the period when the patient has stabilized but the underlying pathology persists. The three great Creeds are not cures. They are **competing diagnoses**: three irreconcilable interpretations of what killed the world and how to prevent it from killing again. **The Age of Creeds is the era when humanity stopped dying of the Glitch and started fighting over what the Glitch meant.** The Great Autopsy continues—not as emergency surgery, but as ongoing philosophical debate with occasional violence.

---

## Temporal Framework: The Standardized Calendar

### Post-Glitch Chronology Stabilization

By the Age of Creeds, the **Dvergr Master Calendar** has achieved near-universal adoption. The calendar fragmentation crisis of the Age of Silence and the coordination challenges of the Age of Wandering have been resolved through economic necessity: those who cannot synchronize with the Dvergr standard cannot trade with the Dvergr Guilds.

| Notation | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Year [###] PG** | Post-Glitch year notation; Year 0 PG = H+72 hours |
| **Age Marker** | Current: "Year 783 PG, Age of Creeds +265" |
| **Factional Overlays** | Iron-Bane liturgical calendar; Skaldic year-naming; Forsaken Ice-Debt Cycles |
| **Coordination Standard** | Dvergr pocket-chronometers; tower synchronization network |
| **Uncertainty Range** | ±0 years (contemporary era; direct observation) |

### Era Subdivisions

| Phase | Year Span | Duration | Defining Character |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Phase I: The Genesis** | 518–550 PG | ~32 years | Creedal doctrines crystallize; first formal institutions |
| **Phase II: The Consolidation** | 550–650 PG | ~100 years | Continent-scale organization; Scriptorium/Forge/Shrine networks |
| **Phase III: The Cold War** | 650–750 PG | ~100 years | Ideological competition; proxy conflicts; crusade chartering |
| **Phase IV: The Fracture** | 750–783 PG | ~33 years | Pact collapse; renewed violence; current instability |

**The Great Question:**
> *"The Age of Walls answered the question of survival: 'How do we not die?' The Age of Creeds inherited a more dangerous question: 'Why did we almost die, and what does it mean that we didn't?' The Aesir had built a machine to command reality. The machine failed. The Fimbulwinter killed ninety percent of humanity. And now, seven centuries later, the survivors' descendants face the unbearable task of making sense of it all. The three Creeds are three answers to this question. The Readers say: 'The ancestors made an error; let us find and correct it.' The Banes say: 'The ancestors made a sin; let us purge and reject it.' The Sleepers say: 'The ancestors made a miracle; let us worship and await it.' All three answers are wrong. All three answers are necessary. The Age of Creeds is the era when humanity discovered that meaning is harder to build than walls."*

## The Genesis of the Schism

### The Spiritual and Intellectual Vacuum

The Age of Creeds was born from the **success** of the Age of Walls. The relative safety, stability, and food surpluses achieved within the fortified Holds provided the necessary "breathing room" for a profound societal shift. With the immediate, daily question of survival—"Will I eat today?"—answered for many, a new, more complex, and more dangerous question rose to dominate the collective consciousness.

| Prerequisite | Achievement | Consequence |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Physical Security** | Walls, perimeters, watch-fires | Safety from Undying; reduced casualty rates |
| **Food Surplus** | Agricultural stabilization | Cognitive surplus; time for contemplation |
| **Trade Networks** | Long Roads; Guild infrastructure | Information exchange; missionary vectors |
| **Generational Distance** | 500+ years post-Glitch | Direct trauma fades; interpretation begins |

### The Great Question

```

THE GREAT QUESTION — IDEOLOGICAL FOUNDATION

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FORMULATION: "Why did the world fall, and what is our place

in this new order?"

EMERGENCE: ~Year 500-520 PG (Age of Walls terminus)

TRIGGER: Food surplus + physical security = cognitive surplus

MECHANISM: Post-survival populations seek meaning frameworks

PROPAGATION: Trade routes carry missionaries alongside grain

VARIANTS:

- Jötun-Reader: "What broke? Can we fix it?"
- Iron-Bane: "What sinned? Can we purify it?"
- God-Sleeper: "What sleeps? Can we wake it?"
- Creed of the Self: "Who cares? Can we profit from it?"

STATUS: UNRESOLVED — Competing answers drive factional conflict

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

```

**The Market for Meaning:**
> *"The merchants' caravans that carried grain and steel now also carried missionaries and zealots. They found a populace hungry for more than just food. They were hungry for purpose, for community, and for a clear path forward in a world that the old sagas could no longer explain. The Creeds offered certainty in an uncertain world, and the people flocked to them. The informal, localized beliefs of the Age of Walls had become continent-spanning, competing, and mutually exclusive ideologies. The battle for physical survival was ending. The battle for the soul of humanity had begun."*

## The Three Great Creeds

### A. The Jötun-Reader Creed ("The Debuggers")

The intellectual heirs of the Aesir Technocracy, tempered by the brutal lesson of their ancestors' ultimate failure. They believe the world is not cursed but **broken**—and that the Great Work is to debug reality itself.

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| **Core Dogma** | "The world is not cursed; it is broken." |
| **Answer to the Great Question** | The ancestors made a compiler error; find and correct it |
| **Philosophical Framework** | Post-Glitch empiricism; pathological diagnosis |
| **Organizational Structure** | Meritocratic hierarchy; Scriptoriums as fortress-libraries |
| **Sacred Purpose** | The Great Work: recover lost "source code"; understand the Glitch |
| **Leadership** | Archivists; Rúnasmiðr; Lex-Guardians (warrior-scholars) |
| **Population Estimate** | ~50,000–75,000 adherents |
| **Primary Settlements** | Scriptorium-Primus; Grey Tower network |

```

JÖTUN-READER CREED — DIAGNOSTIC PROFILE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CLASSIFICATION: Post-Glitch Empiricist Tradition

CORE AXIOM: "That which is not understood is not yet understood"

METHODOLOGY: Evidence-based analysis; source triangulation

SACRED TEXTS: Mimir Archive fragments; recovered Layer 3 documentation

RELATIONSHIP TO ANCESTORS:

- Aesir: Brilliant but fatally hubristic; cautionary example
- Vanir: Marginalized truth-tellers; vindicated by history

PRIMARY ACTIVITY: Ruin reclamation; data recovery; concordance research

THREAT ASSESSMENT (Year 783 PG):

- Iron-Banes: Active adversary; target Scriptoriums for purification
- God-Sleepers: Theological opponents; competition for recruits
- Undying: Research subjects AND existential hazards

OPERATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE:

- Scriptorium network: 12 major installations, ~40 minor outposts
- Courier charter: Sealed messaging across factional boundaries
- Concordance debates: Formal runic interpretation protocols

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

```

**View of Rivals:**
- **Iron-Banes:** Viewed as ignorant, superstitious Luddites. Their crusade to destroy ruins and "tainted" technology is the ultimate sacrilege—the deliberate destruction of diagnostic evidence.
- **God-Sleepers:** Viewed with clinical pity. Their faith is seen as a dangerous, if understandable, pathology—a "collective fever-dream" that mistakes malfunction for divinity.

### B. The Iron-Bane Crusade ("The Purifiers")

The ultimate, violent rejection of the Aesir's technological legacy. A militant, ascetic, and fanatical faith that views the Glitch not as an error but as **divine punishment** for the sin of fusing metal and spirit.

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| **Core Dogma** | "The world is not broken; it is sick." |
| **Answer to the Great Question** | The ancestors committed blasphemy; purge and reject it |
| **Philosophical Framework** | Techno-theological condemnation; ritual purification |
| **Organizational Structure** | Militant hierarchy; Pure Forges as grim fortress-cathedrals |
| **Sacred Purpose** | Act as the world's surgeons; purify through destruction |
| **Leadership** | Forge-Masters; Chapter commanders; Anvil-Speakers |
| **Population Estimate** | ~30,000–50,000 adherents |
| **Primary Settlements** | Pure Forges; Chapter-Houses in neutral territories |

```

IRON-BANE CRUSADE — DIAGNOSTIC PROFILE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CLASSIFICATION: Techno-Theological Militant Order

CORE AXIOM: "That which is not purified is corrupted"

METHODOLOGY: Ritual destruction; controlled reforging; Anvil-Cant

SACRED TEXTS: The Iron Testament; Forge-Hymns; Purification Edicts

RELATIONSHIP TO ANCESTORS:

- Aesir: Archetypal sinners; authors of the Iron-Curse
- Vanir: Marginally less sinful; still complicit

PRIMARY ACTIVITY: Crusades against "tainted" sites; relic destruction

WEAPONIZED LANGUAGE:

- Anvil-Cant: Deliberately engineered rhetorical system
- Function: Ideological warfare; psychological conditioning
- Counter-Cant: Defensive linguistic protocols used by other factions

THREAT ASSESSMENT (Year 783 PG):

- Jötun-Readers: Primary adversary; "heretics" preserving corruption
- God-Sleepers: Blasphemers worshipping "iron idols"
- Undying: Primary purification targets

OPERATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE:

- Pure Forges: 8 major installations
- Chapter-Houses: ~25 outposts in neutral/contested territories
- Crusade routes: Chartered purification campaigns

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

```

**View of Rivals:**
- **Jötun-Readers:** Viewed as heretics and enablers of the Iron-Curse. Their preservation of "tainted knowledge" perpetuates the sickness that killed the world. Scriptorium burnings are acts of sacred hygiene.
- **God-Sleepers:** Viewed as blasphemous idolaters who worship the very machines that embody corruption. Their pilgrimages to dormant Jötun-Forged are processions to false altars.

### C. The God-Sleeper Creed ("The Watchers")

The most populist and widespread of the Creeds, born from the Bunker-Born's first encounters with the Undying. They believe the colossal Jötun-Forged are not malfunctioning machines but **slumbering gods**—and they await the Great Awakening.

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| **Core Dogma** | "The world is not broken; it is sleeping." |
| **Answer to the Great Question** | The ancestors achieved apotheosis; await their return |
| **Philosophical Framework** | Techno-theological worship; prophetic eschatology |
| **Organizational Structure** | Charismatic prophets; pilgrimage circuits; Shrine networks |
| **Sacred Purpose** | Tend the sleeping gods; prepare for the Great Awakening |
| **Leadership** | Prophets; Shrine-Keepers; Pilgrimage-Wardens |
| **Population Estimate** | ~200,000–300,000 adherents |
| **Primary Settlements** | Shrines at dormant Jötun-Forged sites; pilgrimage waypoints |

```

GOD-SLEEPER CREED — DIAGNOSTIC PROFILE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CLASSIFICATION: Techno-Theological Worship Tradition

CORE AXIOM: "That which does not move is not dead but dreaming"

METHODOLOGY: Pilgrimage; shrine-tending; prophetic interpretation

SACRED TEXTS: The Dreaming Codex; Pilgrimage Hymns; Awakening Prophecies

RELATIONSHIP TO ANCESTORS:

- Aesir: Divine beings who transcended flesh
- Vanir: Lesser gods; nature-spirits of the World-Tree

PRIMARY ACTIVITY: Pilgrimages to "humming sites"; shrine maintenance

THEOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK:

- Undying = Sleeping gods awaiting the Great Awakening
- Runic Blight = Divine breath; proof of lingering presence
- Jötun-Forged = Slumbering idols; sacred geometry
- The Glitch = The gods' slumber; not death but transformation

THREAT ASSESSMENT (Year 783 PG):

- Iron-Banes: Murderous iconoclasts; primary violent adversary
- Jötun-Readers: Soulless fools dissecting miracles
- Undying: Objects of worship; NOT targets

OPERATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE:

- Shrines: 50+ major sites at dormant Jötun-Forged locations
- Pilgrimage routes: Continent-spanning sacred circuits
- Synods: Doctrinal coordination assemblies

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

```

**View of Rivals:**
- **Jötun-Readers:** Pitied as "soulless fools" who commit sacrilege by attempting to dissect divine miracles rather than worship them. Analytical reason is a sin against faith.
- **Iron-Banes:** Viewed as murderous iconoclasts who seek to destroy the sleeping gods before they can wake. Their crusades are divine assassination attempts.

---

## The Fourth Philosophy: The Creed of the Self

### The Un-Creed: Philosophy of the Grey

A fourth, shadow-philosophy emerged as a direct and cynical response to the absolute dogmas of the great Creeds. Centered primarily among the **Rust-Clans of Utgard**, the Creed of the Self rejects all three grand narratives.

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| **Core Dogma** | "The world is not broken, sick, or sleeping. It simply is." |
| **Answer to the Great Question** | Who cares? Focus on what's tangible. |
| **Philosophical Framework** | Pragmatic nihilism; transactional ethics |
| **Organizational Structure** | None formal; Rust-Clan affiliations; Scavenger Baron courts |
| **Sacred Purpose** | None; the Self, the Crew, and the Contract |
| **Primary Settlements** | Utgard; northern frontier territories; Dreadnought polities |

**The Trinity of the Immediate:**
> *"The Creed of the Self recognizes only three things worth believing in: the Self, the Crew, and the Contract. The Self is your own survival. The Crew is those who watch your back. The Contract is the only sacred bond—and only sacred until the terms are fulfilled. The Jötun-Forged are not gods, demons, or diagnostic specimens. They are derelict machines, sources of salvage and danger. The great Creeds fight over the soul of humanity. We do not believe humanity has a soul. We believe it has a body, and that body needs feeding."*

**Sanctuary Function:**
Utgard's brutal philosophy has made it a recognized sanctuary for apostates, heretics, and the disillusioned who have fled the rigid dogmas of the main Creeds. Openly preaching the dogma of any of the three Creeds is the fastest way to be thrown from the highest gantry.

---

## Political and Social Architecture

### The Ideological Battleground: Midgard Combine

The **Midgard Combine**—the pragmatic merchant confederation that controls the heartland's agricultural surplus—is the primary ideological battleground precisely because its large, stable, and largely un-affiliated population represents the "soul of the future."

| Faction | Combine Presence | Strategy |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| **Jötun-Readers** | Scriptorium-Annexes; research stations | Knowledge provision; technical consulting |
| **Iron-Banes** | Chapter-Houses; forge-smithies | Purification services; protection contracts |
| **God-Sleepers** | Shrines of the Traveler; waypoint temples | Pilgrimage services; spiritual comfort |
| **Dvergr Guilds** | Trade delegations; craft-halls | Economic infrastructure; neutral arbitration |

### Crossroads: The Neutral Ground

The settlement of **Crossroads** represents the only place where all major factions are forced into constant, volatile coexistence—governed by the Combine's pragmatic law: one's Creed is tolerated, provided it does not disrupt the flow of trade.

```

CROSSROADS — NEUTRAL TERRITORY PROFILE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DESIGNATION: Grand Nexus; Primary Ideological Contact Zone

GOVERNANCE: Midgard Combine commercial law

POPULATION: ~15,000 permanent; ~5,000 transient

CREEDAL PRESENCE:

- Jötun-Readers: Scriptorium-Annex (library and workshop)
- Iron-Banes: Chapter-House (forge and barracks)
- God-Sleepers: Shrine of the Traveler (pilgrimage waypoint)

STABILITY MECHANISM:

- Festival of Embers: Annual one-week truce period
- Grey Blades: Neutral arbitration court
- Economic interdependence: All factions need Combine grain

CONFLICT INCIDENTS (Year 750-783 PG): 47 documented

- Property damage: 23 incidents
- Personal violence: 19 incidents
- Book burnings: 5 incidents

CURRENT STATUS: Fragile equilibrium; Three Creeds Pact collapsed (782 PG)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

```

### The Northern Frontier: Scavenger Barons and Dreadnoughts

In the high-risk northern Decks—particularly **Niflheim** and **Jötunheim**—the Creeds have little influence. The brutal realities of survival in the lingering Fimbulwinter created a power vacuum filled not by faith but by force.

| Entity | Territory | Power Base |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Scavenger Barons** | Northern frontier | Salvage monopolies; geothermal control |
| **Dreadnought Kings** | Mobile; northern routes | Repaired Jötun-Hauler fortresses |
| **Rust-Clans** | Jötunheim interior | Salvage expertise; route knowledge |

**The Dreadnought Polities:**
> *"The Dreadnought Kings are what happens when someone repairs a pre-Glitch Jötun-Hauler transport vehicle and decides to become a god. These mobile fortresses—each one a city on treads, powered by salvaged Aetheric cores—roam the northern wastes, extracting tribute from anyone who cannot flee fast enough. The Creeds call them heretics, apostates, or heathens. The Dreadnought Kings call themselves survivors. In the north, that is the only creed that matters."*

---

## Phase I: The Genesis (518–550 PG)

### Era Boundary: "The Year Walls Became Creeds"

The transition from the Age of Walls to the Age of Creeds occurred gradually, but **Year 518 PG** is recognized as the formal boundary—the point when doctrinal identity superseded territorial identity as the primary organizing principle of post-Glitch society.

| Event ID | Event | Year | Description |
|----------|-------|------|-------------|
| AAM-TIML-CRDS-Y0518-01 | **First Creed Formalizations** | 518 | Foundational creeds coalesce from post-Walls polity doctrines |
| AAM-TIML-CRDS-Y0525-01 | **Scriptorium Charter** | ~525 | First Jötun-Reader fortress-library formally established |
| AAM-TIML-CRDS-Y0530-01 | **Pure Forge Consecration** | ~530 | First Iron-Bane forge-cathedral dedicated |
| AAM-TIML-CRDS-Y0535-01 | **First Great Pilgrimage** | ~535 | God-Sleeper mass pilgrimage to dormant Jötun-Forged site |
| AAM-TIML-CRDS-Y0537-01 | **Year of Burning Questions** | 537 | Major theological debates; Scriptorium establishment controversies |
| AAM-TIML-CRDS-Y0545-01 | **Creed of the Self Emerges** | ~545 | Utgard philosophy crystallizes as counter-narrative |

### The Crystallization Mechanism

```

CREEDAL CRYSTALLIZATION — PHASE I ANALYSIS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PROCESS: Informal beliefs → Formal doctrines → Institutional structures

DURATION: ~32 years (518-550 PG)

ENABLING CONDITIONS:

- Post-Walls stability: Survival no longer consumes all resources
- Generational distance: 500+ years since Glitch; direct trauma fades
- Trade network density: Ideas propagate with goods
- Literacy recovery: Written doctrine possible (Reader influence)

CRYSTALLIZATION SEQUENCE:

1. Philosophical positions articulated (informal; oral tradition)
2. Charismatic leaders emerge (prophets, archivists, forge-masters)
3. Sacred texts composed/compiled (codices, testaments, hymns)
4. Institutional structures formalized (Scriptoriums, Forges, Shrines)
5. Membership criteria established (oaths, initiations, pilgrimages)
6. Inter-creedal boundaries hardened (heresy definitions; enemy designations)

RESULT: Three mutually exclusive meaning-frameworks with institutional

backing, territorial presence, and armed enforcement capability

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

```

---

## Phase II: The Consolidation (550–650 PG)

### Continent-Scale Organization

The second century of the Age of Creeds saw the transformation of local belief communities into **continent-spanning institutional networks**—each with its own infrastructure, economy, and quasi-military capability.

| Event ID | Event | Year | Description |
|----------|-------|------|-------------|
| AAM-TIML-CRDS-Y0558-01 | **Year Children Remembered** | 558 | First generation born entirely post-Age of Walls reaches adulthood |
| AAM-TIML-CRDS-Y0601-01 | **Year of Silent Bells** | 601 | Bell-casting disaster; theological setback symbolism |
| AAM-TIML-CRDS-Y0634-01 | **Year We Lost East Road** | 634 | First major Long Road deprecation; hazard zone expansion |

### Institutional Networks

| Creed | Network Type | Scale (650 PG) | Function |
|-------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| **Jötun-Readers** | Scriptorium League | 8 major, ~25 minor | Knowledge preservation; concordance research |
| **Iron-Banes** | Chapter System | 5 Pure Forges, ~15 outposts | Purification campaigns; forge-craft |
| **God-Sleepers** | Shrine Circuit | 30+ major shrines, pilgrimage routes | Worship; pilgrimage infrastructure |

**The Networks:**
> *"By Year 650, the three Creeds had achieved something unprecedented in post-Glitch history: organizational structures that transcended individual Holds, that could coordinate action across hundreds of kilometers, that possessed their own economies, their own armed forces, and their own bureaucracies. The Scriptorium League could copy and distribute texts from Grey Tower to Crossroads within a month. The Chapter System could muster a crusade of a thousand zealots within a season. The Shrine Circuit could move fifty thousand pilgrims along routes that bypassed every Hold that refused them passage. The Creeds had become states within states—and the states were starting to notice."*

---

## Phase III: The Cold War (650–750 PG)

### The Ideological Arms Race

The third century of the Age of Creeds saw the transformation of philosophical disagreement into **institutionalized conflict**—a cold war fought through missionaries, propaganda, proxy violence, and occasional direct confrontation.

| Event ID | Event | Year | Description |
|----------|-------|------|-------------|
| AAM-TIML-CRDS-Y0702-01 | **Reader Scriptorium Network** | ~702 | Way-Wardens and Readers found first copying houses |
| AAM-TIML-CRDS-Y0708-01 | **Concordance Debates — Dagaz Inversion** | ~708 | Reader scholars formalize pristine vs. inversion rune guidance |
| AAM-TIML-CRDS-Y0715-01 | **God-Sleeper Synod — Utgard** | ~715 | Delegates ratify doctrine on humming sites and pilgrimage protections |
| AAM-TIML-CRDS-Y0725-01 | **Consolidation of the Three Creeds** | ~725 | Jötun-Readers, Iron-Banes, God-Sleepers reach continent-scale organization |
| AAM-TIML-CRDS-Y0732-01 | **Iron-Bane Purity Edicts** | ~732 | Edicts target "tainted" technologies ahead of formal crusades |
| AAM-TIML-CRDS-Y0740-01 | **Iron-Bane Crusades Chartered** | ~740 | First crusading chapters receive charters; purification campaigns begin |

### The Cold War Mechanisms

```

COLD WAR OF SOULS — CONFLICT ANALYSIS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DURATION: ~100 years (650-750 PG)

INTENSITY: Low-grade continuous; periodic escalation

MECHANISMS:

1. MISSIONARY COMPETITION
    - All three Creeds deploy missionaries along trade routes
    - "Market for meaning" creates recruitment pressure
    - Conversion campaigns target unaffiliated Combine population
2. PROPAGANDA WARFARE
    - Anvil-Cant: Iron-Bane weaponized language system
    - Counter-cant: Defensive linguistic protocols (Reader development)
    - Hymns, sermons, illustrated texts for illiterate populations
3. PROXY VIOLENCE
    - Patron support for sympathetic Hold leaders
    - Economic pressure on hostile settlements
    - Pilgrim "protection" as territorial assertion
4. DIRECT CONFRONTATION (LIMITED)
    - Book burnings (Iron-Bane → Reader targets)
    - Shrine desecrations (Iron-Bane → God-Sleeper targets)
    - Assassination of charismatic leaders (all factions)

CONSTRAINT MECHANISM:

- Economic interdependence via Dvergr Guild network
- Combine grain dependence creates truce incentives
- Mutual Undying threat requires occasional cooperation

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

```

### The Crusade Era (740+ PG)

The formal chartering of Iron-Bane crusading chapters marked the transition from ideological competition to **organized military campaign**—though targets remained primarily pre-Glitch ruins and "corrupted" sites rather than rival creedal populations (with notable exceptions).

| Crusade Type | Target | Frequency | Violence Level |
|--------------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Ruin Purification** | Pre-Glitch sites; Undying concentrations | Continuous | High (against machines) |
| **Book Burning** | Scriptorium outposts; knowledge caches | Episodic | Moderate (property) |
| **Idol Breaking** | God-Sleeper shrines; pilgrimage waypoints | Episodic | Variable |
| **Heretic Hunting** | Individual apostates; creedal leaders | Rare | Lethal (targeted) |

---

## Phase IV: The Fracture (750–783 PG)

### The Failed Peace

The final decades of the Age of Creeds (to present) have seen the **collapse of accommodation frameworks** that had previously contained inter-creedal violence.

| Event ID | Event | Year | Description |
|----------|-------|------|-------------|
| AAM-TIML-CRDS-Y0751-01 | **Scriptorium Courier Charter** | ~751 | Reader courier network formalized with seals and safe-conduct |
| AAM-TIML-CRDS-Y0760-01 | **Scriptorium League Charter** | ~760 | Copying houses federate; vellum, inks, gloss notation standardized |
| AAM-TIML-CRDS-Y0772-01 | **Iron-Bane Marches — Northern Corridor** | ~772 | Crusade chapters establish presence along northern routes |
| AAM-TIML-CRDS-Y0779-01 | **Factional Conflict Incident** | 779 | Iron-Bane vs. God-Sleeper violence at pilgrimage site |
| AAM-TIML-CRDS-Y0782-01 | **Three Creeds Pact Collapse** | ~782 | Mutual guarantees fail; raids and burnings resume |

### The Pact Collapse (782 PG)

```

THREE CREEDS PACT COLLAPSE — EVENT ANALYSIS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

EVENT ID: AAM-TIML-CRDS-Y0782-01

DATE: Year 782 PG (approximate)

CLASSIFICATION: Political Catastrophe

DESCRIPTION:

The informal accommodation framework that had limited inter-creedal

violence collapsed following a series of escalating incidents:

IMMEDIATE TRIGGERS:

- Scriptorium courier murdered by Iron-Bane patrol (Spring 782)
- Retaliatory seizure of Iron-Bane trade goods (Summer 782)
- God-Sleeper pilgrims detained at Combine checkpoint (Fall 782)
- Iron-Bane crusade targets Reader-affiliated Hold (Winter 782)

STRUCTURAL CAUSES:

- New generation of creedal leaders without memory of worst violence
- Economic pressure from declining trade route network
- Combine neutrality perceived as weakness by all parties
- Eschatological urgency among God-Sleepers (800 PG approaching)

CURRENT STATUS (Year 783 PG):

- Renewed book burnings along frontier Holds
- Pilgrimage routes contested; shrine desecrations reported
- Scriptorium couriers traveling with armed escort
- Crossroads truce holding but strained

PROGNOSIS: Escalation likely; de-escalation mechanisms exhausted

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

```

**The Present Crisis:**
> *"The Year 783 PG finds the Age of Creeds in crisis. The fragile accommodations that had prevented the cold war from becoming a hot one have collapsed. Iron-Bane crusade chapters are burning books again. God-Sleeper pilgrimages are being 'diverted' by armed escorts. Scriptorium couriers carry weapons alongside their message-pouches. The Crossroads truce holds, but everyone knows it holds because no one can afford to break it—yet. The Great Question remains unanswered. The three Creeds remain irreconcilable. And the patient—humanity itself—remains in the chronic phase of a disease contracted seven centuries ago. The Great Autopsy continues. The prognosis is uncertain."*

---

## Factional Interpretations

### Layer 1 (Mythic): The Battle for Truth

To the common folk of the Age of Echoes, the Age of Creeds is the **Battle for Truth**—the time when the survivors of the Long Night emerged from their hiding places and began to argue about what the silence of the gods meant.

> *"When the ice retreated and the sun returned, our ancestors climbed from the deep places and looked upon the ruins of the gods' kingdom. And they asked: 'What happened? Why did the gods fall? What must we do to survive in this broken world?' Three answers came. The Grey-Robes said: 'The gods made a mistake. We must learn from it.' The Soot-Faces said: 'The gods sinned. We must burn their works.' The White-Walkers said: 'The gods sleep. We must tend their dreaming.' And so the battle began—not a battle of swords and spears, but a battle of words and beliefs. For seven lifetimes we have fought this battle. The gods do not wake to settle it. Perhaps they never will. Perhaps the answer is not in their silence, but in our shouting."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Grey-Robes, Soot-Faces, White-Walkers, the gods, the Battle for Truth, the silence
**Prohibited vocabulary**: Jötun-Reader, Iron-Bane, God-Sleeper (formal designations), FUTHARK, recursive paradox

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic): The Chronic Phase

The Jötun-Reader Scriptorium views the Age of Creeds as the **chronic phase** of the pathology initiated by the Ginnungagap Glitch—the period when the disease has stabilized but continues to shape the patient's existence.

> *"The Age of Creeds represents the transition from acute crisis to chronic condition. The immediate symptoms of the Glitch—the Fimbulwinter, the Great Forgetting, the population collapse—have resolved. What remains is the underlying pathology: a civilization living inside the corpse of its predecessor, unable to either fully recover the lost knowledge or fully abandon the attempt. The three Creeds are not cures. They are **competing symptom management protocols**—each one addressing a different aspect of the chronic condition. The Readers address the cognitive dimension: the loss of technical knowledge. The Banes address the psychological dimension: the trauma of survival. The Sleepers address the spiritual dimension: the need for meaning. None of them treats the underlying pathology. None of them can. The Great Autopsy continues not because we expect to cure the patient, but because diagnosis is the only treatment available."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Chronic phase, symptom management, pathological persistence, diagnostic category
**Prohibited vocabulary**: Divine will, sacred battle, fate, cosmic struggle

### Layer 3 (Technical): The Ideological Proliferation

Recovered technical frameworks—adapted from pre-Glitch organizational science—provide analytical tools for understanding the Age of Creeds as a **memetic propagation phenomenon**.

> *"IDEOLOGICAL PROPAGATION ANALYSIS — AGE OF CREEDS. Document ID: IPA-CRDS-001. Classification: ARCHIVAL SYNTHESIS. Abstract: The Age of Creeds represents a case study in post-catastrophe meaning-system proliferation. Three primary ideological frameworks emerged from the same environmental conditions (post-Fimbulwinter stability; surplus economy; trade network connectivity) and achieved continent-scale propagation within approximately 200 years. Analysis suggests competitive exclusion dynamics: each framework occupies a distinct ecological niche (empiricist, purgative, transcendent) and resists displacement. Current equilibrium (Year 783 PG) appears unstable; perturbation events (Pact Collapse, 782 PG) may initiate transition to new attractor state. Recommendation: Monitor for cascade indicators."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Memetic propagation, ideological framework, competitive exclusion, attractor state
**Prohibited vocabulary**: Mythic epithets, emotional framing, moral judgment

### Layer 4 (Omniscient): The Ground Truth

> *"The Age of Creeds is what happens when a species survives catastrophe and then has to explain its survival to itself. The three Creeds are not right or wrong. They are **adaptive responses** to an impossible situation: inheriting a world built by entities whose capabilities vastly exceeded your own, destroyed by forces you cannot fully understand, and populated by artifacts that blur the line between machine and monster. The Readers are correct that understanding the Glitch is important. The Banes are correct that the Aesir's technology was dangerous. The Sleepers are correct that the Undying are awe-inspiring. All three are wrong in believing their answer is sufficient. The Great Question—'Why did the world fall?'—has a technical answer: the All-Rune created a recursive paradox that destroyed O.D.I.N. But the question beneath the question—'What does this mean for us?'—has no answer. Meaning is not discovered. It is constructed. The Age of Creeds is the era of construction. What humanity builds from the rubble of the Age of Forging will determine whether the Glitch was an ending or a beginning. Seven centuries have passed. The construction continues. The blueprint remains unclear."*

## Change Log

| Version | Tier | Summary |
|---------|------|---------|
| **v1.0** | A — Published (Canonical) | Comprehensive Archives Master profile of the Age of Creeds (518–783 PG, ~265 years, ongoing). Temporal framework established: Dvergr Master Calendar standardization, era subdivisions (Genesis, Consolidation, Cold War, Fracture). The Great Question documented: "Why did the world fall, and what is our place in this new order?"—the foundational crisis driving creedal emergence. Three Great Creeds profiled: Jötun-Readers (empiricist; "world is broken"), Iron-Banes (purgative; "world is sick"), God-Sleepers (transcendent; "world is sleeping"). Fourth philosophy documented: Creed of the Self (pragmatic nihilism; Utgard sanctuary). Political architecture detailed: Midgard Combine as battleground, Crossroads as neutral ground, northern frontier as creedless zone. Cold War mechanisms catalogued: missionary competition, propaganda warfare (Anvil-Cant), proxy violence, limited direct confrontation. Phase IV crisis documented: Three Creeds Pact Collapse (782 PG), renewed inter-creedal violence, current instability (783 PG). Institutional infrastructure detailed: Scriptorium League, Chapter System, Shrine Circuit, Dreadnought polities. Four-layer voice guidance established: L1 (Mythic), L2 (Diagnostic), L3 (Technical), L4 (Omniscient Ground Truth). Cross-referenced to all Five Ages, major factions, related systems, and key events. The Age of Creeds represents the chronic phase of the Great Autopsy—the era when humanity stopped dying from the Glitch and started fighting over what the Glitch meant. The patient has stabilized. The diagnosis remains contested. The prognosis is uncertain. |
