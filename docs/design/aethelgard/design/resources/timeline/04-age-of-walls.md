# The Age of Walls — The Settling
## Archives Entry: AAM-HIST-WALL-001

> *"We excavated the foundations of Keel-Grip Hold for three seasons before we understood what we were looking at. The original settlers had not merely built a fortress—they had built a *statement*. The outer walls were constructed from salvaged Jötunheim industrial plating: six meters thick, reinforced with Thurisaz-inscribed anchor bolts they could not have understood but somehow knew would work. The inner walls were different. Layered stone, handmade mortar, the patient craft of people who had decided to stay. The transition point—where industrial salvage gave way to original construction—was marked by a single carved inscription: 'HERE WE STOP.' Not 'here we rest.' Not 'here we shelter.' 'Here we stop.' After one hundred sixty-five years of walking, of running, of dying on the Long Roads, the settlers of Keel-Grip had made a choice that terrified them. They stopped. They built walls. They said: 'Whatever comes, we face it here.' The Age of Walls was not the triumph of civilization over chaos. It was the triumph of stubbornness over despair. They built walls not because walls could save them, but because walls meant they had chosen to be saved."*

The Age of Walls was humanity's first attempt to stop running from the corpse and start living in it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **THE GREAT AUTOPSY: CHRONIC ADAPTATION PHASE.** If the Age of Forging represents the pathological specimen and the Age of Silence represents the acute symptomatic phase, the Age of Walls represents the **chronic adaptation phase**—the period when the survivors stopped dying of the disease and began learning to live with it. Every fortified settlement is a scar tissue formation. Every Guild charter is an immune response. Every salvaged rune is an attempt to metabolize the poison that had killed the ancestors. **The Age of Walls is not recovery. It is the body learning to function with permanent damage.** The walls were not built to keep the Blight out. They were built to define where humanity ended and the Blight began.

## Temporal Framework: The Settling Years

### The Calendar Stabilization

The Age of Walls marked the first successful attempt at unified timekeeping since the Ginnungagap Glitch. The Dvergr Master Calendar—proposed during the Age of Silence and refined through the Age of Wandering—achieved broad adoption as permanent settlements required synchronized record-keeping.

| Milestone | Year | Significance |
|-----------|------|--------------|
| **Dvergr Calendar Consensus** | ~250 PG | Five major caravan networks adopt standardized notation |
| **First Written Records** | ~295 PG | Keel-Grip Hold establishes archival practice |
| **Guild Chronometry** | ~350 PG | Artificer Guilds produce standardized timepieces |
| **Cross-Settlement Synchronization** | ~400 PG | Major holds agree on year-count verification |
| **Current Standard** | 783 PG | Dvergr Master Calendar universally recognized |

### Era Subdivisions

| Phase | Year Span | Duration | Defining Character |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Phase I: The First Holds** | 287–350 PG | ~63 years | Settlement foundation; defensive construction; caravan integration |
| **Phase II: The Guild-Rise** | 350–420 PG | ~70 years | Craft specialization; Guild formalization; trade standardization |
| **Phase III: The Territory Wars** | 420–470 PG | ~50 years | Resource conflict; inter-settlement violence; boundary establishment |
| **Phase IV: The Compact Era** | 470–518 PG | ~48 years | Diplomatic frameworks; factional coalescence; ideological divergence |

**The Decision to Stay:**
> *"The caravans had taught humanity to survive by moving—always moving, never stopping long enough for the Blight to find you, never settling long enough for the Undying to map your patterns. For one hundred sixty-five years, the survivors of Aethelgard had been nomads in the ruins of their ancestors. The Age of Walls began when someone asked a different question: 'What if we stopped?' Not because stopping was safe—it wasn't. Not because stopping was easy—it was terrifying. But because after five generations of running, humanity had discovered something the Bunker-Born had always known: you cannot outrun a corpse. You can only learn to live inside it. The walls were not barriers against the outside. They were commitments to the inside. Every stone laid was a declaration: 'We choose to be here. We choose to stay. We choose to face what comes.'"*

## The First Holds: Foundation of Permanence

### Settlement Selection Criteria

The transition from caravan life to permanent settlement was not random. Surviving records reveal a sophisticated (if informal) assessment protocol for identifying viable hold locations.

### The Foundational Holds

The first generation of permanent settlements established during Phase I became the template for all subsequent construction—and the political cores of later factional territories.

| Hold | Foundation | Location | Population (518 PG) | Current Status (783 PG) |
|------|------------|----------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Keel-Grip Hold** | ~287 PG | Midgard Deck (The Shallows) | ~3,200 | Combine administrative center |
| **Frost-Haven** | ~291 PG | Niflheim border zone | ~1,800 | Iron-Bane monastery-fortress |
| **Forge-Home** | ~295 PG | Jötunheim industrial ruins | ~2,400 | Dvergr Guild headquarters |
| **Wind-Whisper** | ~302 PG | Alfheim perimeter | ~1,100 | Skald tradition center |
| **Stone-Root** | ~308 PG | Svartalfheim upper galleries | ~2,900 | Deep mining hub |
| **The Scarhold** | ~315 PG | The Scar rim (Midgard) | ~800 | Jötun-Reader Scriptorium |

### Defensive Architecture: The Wall Doctrine

The characteristic architecture of the Age of Walls emerged from a synthesis of three knowledge traditions: Dvergr engineering principles (preserved from the Age of Forging), caravan practical experience, and trial-and-error adaptation to post-Glitch hazards.

| Element | Function | Construction |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Outer Perimeter** | Undying deterrence; patrol disruption | Salvaged industrial plate; Thurisaz anchoring |
| **Inner Bailey** | Population shelter; final refuge | Handmade stone; mortar composite |
| **Ward Stations** | Blight detection; anomaly early-warning | Algiz-inscribed monitoring arrays |
| **Gate Complexes** | Access control; quarantine capability | Triple-barrier design; kill-zone architecture |
| **Watch Towers** | Surveillance; signal relay | Elevated platforms; fire-beacon network |

```

**The Perimeter Doctrine:**
> *"The first lesson of wall-building was learned in blood. Caravan-Leader Sif the Steady founded a settlement in Year 289—a good location by all measures, defensible terrain, clean water, salvage access. She built walls of raw stone, high and thick, proof against any physical assault. In Year 291, the settlement was empty. Not destroyed—*empty*. No bodies, no signs of struggle, no indication of what had happened. The Jötun-Readers who investigated decades later found the cause: an unmarked Algiz beacon, buried in the foundation stones, had inverted during the Glitch. The walls had not kept the danger out. They had kept the population *in*—concentrated, contained, and slowly consumed by a hazard they could not see. The second lesson of wall-building was: know what you're building with. Every stone must be tested. Every salvage piece must be verified. The walls are only as safe as their components."*

## The Guild-Rise: Institutionalization of Survival

### The Guild System Emergence

The Guild system—the defining institutional innovation of the Age of Walls—emerged from the practical necessity of preserving and transmitting specialized knowledge in a world that had nearly lost everything.

| Factor | Caravan Era (Pre-287 PG) | Age of Walls Transformation |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Knowledge Transfer** | Family lineages; informal apprenticeship | Formalized training; standardized curricula |
| **Quality Control** | Reputation-based | Guild certification; standard specifications |
| **Resource Access** | First-come opportunism | Territorial allocation; extraction rights |
| **Dispute Resolution** | Caravan-leader arbitration | Guild courts; inter-Guild compacts |
| **Innovation** | Individual experimentation | Collaborative research; knowledge sharing |

### Major Guild Formations

| Guild | Formation | Specialty | Political Alignment (518 PG) |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Artificer's Guild** | ~320 PG | Runic salvage; device maintenance | Proto-Jötun-Reader |
| **Dvergr Craft-Halls** | ~335 PG | Metallurgy; precision manufacturing | Independent (later Combine-aligned) |
| **Builder's Compact** | ~348 PG | Fortification; infrastructure | Combine |
| **Healer's Circle** | ~355 PG | Medicine; Blight treatment | Neutral (later factional split) |
| **Warden's Brotherhood** | ~362 PG | Defense; Undying engagement | Pre-Iron-Bane |
| **Merchant's League** | ~380 PG | Trade; resource distribution | Combine |
| **Skald's Conclave** | ~395 PG | History; oral tradition; diplomacy | Neutral |

### Guild Charter Structure

```

GUILD CHARTER TEMPLATE — ARCHIVAL SPECIMEN

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DOCUMENT: Builder's Compact Founding Charter (Year 348 PG)

CLASSIFICATION: GOVERNANCE // INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

```

**The Knowledge Compact:**
> *"The Guilds were not merely trade organizations—they were knowledge-preservation systems designed to prevent a second Great Forgetting. Every Guild charter contained the same foundational clause: 'Knowledge hoarding prohibited; sharing mandated.' The survivors of the Age of Silence had learned what happened when expertise died with its holders. The Guilds were humanity's immune response to that lesson. Every apprentice was required to document what they learned. Every technique was written down, diagrammed, preserved against the death of its practitioner. The Guilds did not trust individuals to remember. They trusted paper, stone, and the institutional commitment to never forget again."*

## The Territory Wars: The Price of Permanence

### Conflict Dynamics

The transition from nomadic to settled life created a fundamental resource conflict that the caravan era had avoided: competition for fixed territory. The Territory Wars (420–470 PG) represented the violent negotiation of boundaries that would define Aethelgard's political geography for centuries.

| Conflict Type | Cause | Frequency | Resolution Pattern |
|---------------|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Salvage Rights** | Overlapping extraction claims | High (~60% of conflicts) | Guild arbitration; territorial division |
| **Water Access** | Aquifer control; river rights | Moderate (~25%) | Compact negotiation; shared management |
| **Arable Land** | Agricultural expansion | Moderate (~10%) | Population exchange; boundary adjustment |
| **Strategic Position** | Trade route control | Low (~5%) | Military resolution; absorption |

### Major Conflicts

| Conflict | Years | Parties | Outcome |
|----------|-------|---------|---------|
| **The Salvage War** | 423–427 PG | Forge-Home vs. Stone-Root | Dvergr Compact; extraction zone delineation |
| **The Water Dispute** | 431–433 PG | Keel-Grip vs. Wind-Whisper | Shared aquifer management protocol |
| **The Scar Conflict** | 445–452 PG | Multiple claimants | Scarhold neutralization; Jötun-Reader custody |
| **The Road War** | 458–465 PG | Merchant's League vs. regional holds | Trade route standardization; toll protocols |
| **The Bitter Peace** | 467–470 PG | General settlement | First Inter-Hold Compact ratification |

### The First Inter-Hold Compact

```

THE FIRST INTER-HOLD COMPACT — SUMMARY EXTRACT

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DOCUMENT: AAM-GOV-COMPACT-001 (Year 470 PG)

CLASSIFICATION: GOVERNANCE // DIPLOMATIC FRAMEWORK

RATIFICATION: Year 470 PG; 12 founding holds

PURPOSE:

"To establish boundaries of territory, protocols of trade,

and mechanisms of dispute resolution, that the holds of

the survivors may cease their warring and direct their

strength against the true enemies: the Blight, the Undying,

and the silence that would consume us all."

KEY PROVISIONS:

1. TERRITORIAL RECOGNITION
    - Each hold's boundaries defined and mutually recognized
    - Boundary disputes resolved by Skald arbitration
    - Expansion requires neighbor consultation
2. TRADE PROTOCOLS
    - Standard weights and measures established
    - Toll limits negotiated and published
    - Currency equivalence tables maintained
3. MUTUAL DEFENSE
    - Undying incursion triggers assistance obligation
    - Blight outbreak requires information sharing
    - No hold to harbor raiders or oath-breakers
4. GUILD INTEGRATION
    - Guild jurisdiction recognized across boundaries
    - Inter-Guild disputes resolved by Guild courts
    - No hold to interfere in internal Guild matters

SIGNATORIES: [12 Hold-Leader marks; 8 Guild-Master marks]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

```

**The Cost of Territory:**
> *"The Territory Wars killed approximately twelve thousand people over fifty years—more than the Fimbulwinter's final decade. The survivors who had endured the Age of Silence, who had walked the Long Roads of the Age of Wandering, who had built walls against the darkness, turned those walls against each other. The Jötun-Readers record the Territory Wars as a diagnostic inevitability: when nomads become settlers, they must define where one settlement ends and another begins. That definition is always written in blood. The First Inter-Hold Compact was not a triumph of diplomacy. It was an armistice born of exhaustion. The holds stopped fighting not because they had resolved their differences, but because they could no longer afford the cost of pursuing them."*

---

## The Compact Era: Seeds of the Creeds

### Proto-Factional Emergence

The final phase of the Age of Walls (470–518 PG) saw the consolidation of the ideological positions that would define the Age of Creeds. Three distinct approaches to understanding and surviving in the post-Glitch world began to crystallize.

| Proto-Faction | Core Question | Answer | Institutional Base |
|---------------|---------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Proto-Combine** | "How do we survive?" | Practical cooperation; resource optimization | Keel-Grip Hold; Merchant's League |
| **Proto-Iron-Bane** | "Why did this happen?" | Divine punishment; moral failure | Frost-Haven; Warden's Brotherhood |
| **Proto-Jötun-Reader** | "What actually happened?" | Technical analysis; diagnostic investigation | The Scarhold; Artificer's Guild |

### The Scarhold Charter: Birth of the Jötun-Readers

The formal establishment of the Jötun-Reader Scriptorium in Year 486 PG marked the institutionalization of the diagnostic approach to understanding the Ginnungagap Glitch.

```

JÖTUN-READER SCRIPTORIUM — FOUNDING CHARTER (EXCERPT)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DOCUMENT: AAM-FOUND-JR-001 (Year 486 PG)

CLASSIFICATION: INSTITUTIONAL // FOUNDING DOCUMENT

PREAMBLE:

"We, the readers of the giants' work, the students of the

broken runes, the archivists of the dead god's memory, do

hereby establish this Scriptorium for the pursuit of the

Great Work: the autopsy of the Age of Forging and the

diagnosis of the Ginnungagap Glitch."

CORE TENETS:

1. THE GREAT AUTOPSY
    - The world is the corpse of a technological civilization
    - Understanding the cause of death is survival-critical
    - All phenomena are symptoms; all symptoms have causes
2. THE LAYER FRAMEWORK
    - Layer 1: What people believe (mythic interpretation)
    - Layer 2: What we can determine (diagnostic analysis)
    - Layer 3: What actually was (technical truth)
    - Progression from 1→3 is the purpose of scholarship
3. THE ETYMOLOGICAL METHOD
    - Trace mythic vocabulary to technical origins
    - Document the drift from precision to poetry
    - Recover Layer 3 knowledge through Layer 1 analysis
4. THE DIAGNOSTIC DISCIPLINE
    - No phenomenon is supernatural; all are explicable
    - No artifact is cursed; all are corrupted technology
    - No entity is divine; all are systems in failure states

FOUNDING MASTERS: [7 signatures]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

```

### The Warden Schism: Seed of the Iron-Bane

The theological interpretation of the Ginnungagap Glitch—treating it as divine punishment rather than technical failure—crystallized within the Warden's Brotherhood during the 490s PG.

| Year | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 488 PG | **The Frost-Haven Revelation** | Warden-Master Björn claims divine vision |
| 492 PG | **The Purification Doctrine** | Moral interpretation of Glitch formalized |
| 496 PG | **The Warden Schism** | Brotherhood splits: pragmatists vs. theologians |
| 503 PG | **First Iron-Bane Liturgy** | Theological faction formalizes worship practices |
| 512 PG | **The Anvil Declaration** | Proto-Iron-Bane separates from Warden's Brotherhood |

**The Fork in Understanding:**
> *"By Year 500 PG, the survivors of Aethelgard had developed three incompatible answers to the same question: 'Why did the world end?' The proto-Combine said: 'It doesn't matter why—what matters is how we survive.' The proto-Iron-Bane said: 'We angered the gods with our hubris, and must purify ourselves to earn forgiveness.' The proto-Jötun-Readers said: 'The Aesir built a machine that couldn't handle a paradox, and we're living in the crash site.' These three answers were not merely different—they were mutually exclusive. The pragmatists found the theologians dangerously irrational. The theologians found the scholars dangerously impious. The scholars found both insufficiently curious. The Age of Walls built walls between settlements. The Age of Creeds would build walls between ways of seeing the world."*

---

## Infrastructure: The Salvage Economy

### Runic Salvage Operations

The Age of Walls systematized the opportunistic scavenging of the Wandering era into organized salvage operations. For the first time since the Glitch, humans began to approach pre-Glitch technology with something approaching methodology.

| Salvage Category | Risk Level | Value | Primary Source |
|------------------|------------|-------|----------------|
| **Structural Materials** | Low | Moderate | All tiers |
| **Mechanical Components** | Moderate | High | Jötunheim; Svartalfheim |
| **Runic Arrays (Inert)** | Moderate | Very High | All tiers |
| **Runic Arrays (Active)** | Extreme | Critical | Restricted access |
| **Data Storage** | Variable | Incalculable | Alfheim; Asgard perimeter |
| **Power Systems** | Extreme | Critical | Muspelheim; Niflheim |

### The H-Index System

The Age of Walls saw the first systematic attempt to classify pre-Glitch hazards—the predecessor to the modern H-Index framework.

```

HAZARD CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM — EARLY FORM (YEAR ~380 PG)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SOURCE: Artificer's Guild Internal Documentation

CLASSIFICATION: OPERATIONAL // RISK ASSESSMENT

CATEGORY A: SAFE (Modern H-Index 1-6)

- Inert materials; structural components
- No detectable Aetheric signature
- Standard handling protocols

CATEGORY B: CAUTION (Modern H-Index 7-12)

- Low-level Aetheric activity
- Potential for malfunction under stress
- Specialist handling required

CATEGORY C: DANGER (Modern H-Index 13-17)

- Active Aetheric signatures
- Documented malfunction potential
- Guild Master supervision required

CATEGORY D: FORBIDDEN (Modern H-Index 18+)

- Extreme Aetheric instability
- Contact prohibition
- Jötun-Reader consultation mandatory

NOTE: This classification predates the formal H-Index scale

established in Year 612 PG. Modern hazard ratings have been

retroactively applied to surviving Category designations.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

```

### Trade Network Development

The permanent settlements of the Age of Walls enabled something the Wandering era could not sustain: regular, predictable trade routes between fixed points.

| Route | Endpoints | Primary Goods | Establishment |
|-------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **The Steel Road** | Forge-Home ↔ Keel-Grip | Metalwork; agricultural goods | ~310 PG |
| **The Cold Path** | Frost-Haven ↔ Stone-Root | Preserved foods; deep minerals | ~325 PG |
| **The Scar Run** | The Scarhold ↔ Multiple | Salvage artifacts; archival materials | ~340 PG |
| **The Ring Road** | Circular (6 major holds) | General commerce | ~390 PG |
| **The Deep Way** | Surface ↔ Svartalfheim | Dvergr crafts; surface goods | ~410 PG |

---

## Population and Society

### Demographic Recovery

The Age of Walls marked the first sustained population growth since the Ginnungagap Glitch.

| Year | Estimated Population | Growth Rate | Notes |
|------|---------------------|-------------|-------|
| 287 PG | ~60,000 | N/A | Era beginning; caravan census estimates |
| 350 PG | ~85,000 | ~0.5%/year | First Holds stabilization |
| 420 PG | ~120,000 | ~0.5%/year | Pre-Territory Wars peak |
| 470 PG | ~95,000 | Negative | Post-Territory Wars nadir |
| 518 PG | ~130,000 | ~0.6%/year | Era end; recovery complete |

### Social Stratification

The fixed nature of settlements enabled social hierarchies impossible in caravan life.

| Stratum | Composition | Population % | Characteristics |
|---------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Hold-Leaders** | Settlement rulers; founding families | ~2% | Political authority; resource control |
| **Guild Masters** | Craft specialists; institutional leaders | ~5% | Technical expertise; economic power |
| **Skilled Workers** | Guild members; trained professionals | ~25% | Craft knowledge; stable employment |
| **Common Labor** | Agricultural workers; unskilled labor | ~55% | Limited mobility; subsistence living |
| **Outsiders** | Non-citizens; refugees; exiles | ~13% | No legal protections; precarious existence |

**The End of Equality:**
> *"The caravans had been egalitarian by necessity—when survival depended on mobility, no one could accumulate more than they could carry. The settlements changed everything. For the first time since the Glitch, it became possible to own things that stayed in one place: land, buildings, workshops, walls. And once ownership became possible, hierarchy became inevitable. The first generation of settlers shared equally because they remembered the Long Roads. Their children shared less equally because they did not. Their grandchildren created laws to protect what they had accumulated. By Year 450, the holds had developed recognizable social classes—and the justifications to explain why those classes were natural, necessary, and permanent."*

## Factional Interpretations

### Layer 1 (Mythic): The Time of Building

To the common folk of the Age of Creeds, the Age of Walls is the era when the survivors stopped fleeing the wrath of the gods and began to rebuild what had been lost.

> *"When the Long Night ended and the Long Roads grew still, our ancestors looked upon the bones of the old world and said: 'Here we shall make our stand.' They raised walls from the flesh of the dead giants. They forged tools from the fallen stars. They carved their names into the earth and said: 'We are here. We endure. The gods are gone, but we remain.' The Age of Walls was the first age of hope—the time when humanity dared to believe that survival was not merely possible, but purposeful. The holds they built still stand. The walls they raised still protect us. The courage they found still burns in our hearts. We are the children of the builders. We are the heirs of the walls."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: The builders, the old holds, the founding, the giants' bones, the first hope
**Prohibited vocabulary**: Salvage, infrastructure, Guild charter, proto-faction, technical

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic): The Chronic Adaptation Phase

The Jötun-Reader Scriptorium views the Age of Walls as the period when humanity transitioned from acute survival to chronic adaptation—learning to function with permanent damage rather than hoping for recovery.

> *"The Age of Walls represents the chronic adaptation phase of the civilizational disease initiated by the Ginnungagap Glitch. The acute symptoms—the Fimbulwinter, the Great Forgetting, the population collapse—had stabilized. What remained was permanent damage: the Blight, the Undying, the loss of technical knowledge. The settlements were not recovery; they were scar tissue. The Guilds were not institutions; they were immune responses. The walls were not protection; they were the body learning to encapsulate what it could not expel. The Age of Walls teaches us that survival is not the same as healing. The survivors learned to function with the disease still inside them. That adaptation—not cure—is what we inherited."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Chronic phase, adaptation, scar tissue, immune response, encapsulation
**Prohibited vocabulary**: Divine will, punishment, blessing, fate, destiny

### Layer 3 (Technical): The Infrastructure Recovery

Surviving technical documentation from the Age of Walls focuses on practical construction, resource management, and systematic salvage operations.

> *"SETTLEMENT FOUNDATION PROTOCOL — KEEL-GRIP STANDARD. Document ID: SFP-KG-001. Classification: CONSTRUCTION // FOUNDATION. Abstract: This protocol establishes minimum requirements for permanent settlement construction in post-Glitch environmental conditions. Primary considerations: (1) Water source verification and contamination testing; (2) Defensive perimeter establishment with Thurisaz-anchored salvage materials; (3) Ward station placement for Blight detection and Undying early warning; (4) Agricultural capacity assessment including growing season calculation and soil contamination analysis. Population threshold: minimum 150 individuals with documented skill distribution. Survival probability estimate: 65-80% at 10-year horizon given protocol compliance. Note: This protocol supersedes caravan-era opportunistic settlement practices."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Protocol, specification, threshold, compliance, probability
**Prohibited vocabulary**: Mythic epithets, theological interpretation, emotional framing

### Layer 4 (Omniscient): The Ground Truth

> *"The Age of Walls was humanity's first attempt to impose order on chaos—not the perfect order the Aesir had sought, but the messy, practical order of walls and boundaries, Guilds and charters, treaties and compromises. For 231 years, the survivors stopped running and started building. They created institutions that would outlast individuals. They established boundaries that would outlast conflicts. They developed frameworks for cooperation that would outlast disagreements. None of it was elegant. The Guilds were compromises between knowledge preservation and economic self-interest. The holds were compromises between defensibility and livability. The compacts were compromises between autonomy and mutual survival. But compromise is not failure. It is the recognition that imperfect systems which function are better than perfect systems that don't. The Age of Walls did not solve the problem of living in the corpse of a dead civilization. It simply made that problem survivable—and survivability, in the end, is all that evolution requires."*
