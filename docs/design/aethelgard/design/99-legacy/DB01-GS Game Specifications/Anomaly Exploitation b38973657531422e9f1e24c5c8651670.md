## Thematic Description

> *"What kills the unprepared can be turned against enemies. You've learned to weaponize the Old World's broken systems."*
> 

The master Ruin-Stalker understands that anomalies aren't just hazards—they're **weapons waiting for a user**. By manipulating the unstable systems of the Old World, you can redirect their dangers toward your enemies, converting environmental threats into tactical advantages.

- **Controllers**: [Disoriented] stacks with other debuffs
- **Psychic damage specialists**: Script damage synergizes

1. Identify anomaly type during exploration
2. Lure enemies near anomaly
3. Trigger exploitation when positioned
4. Capitalize on status effects

### Rank 3: Remote Trigger

- Set up anomaly traps before combat
- Trigger from safe distance
- Ambush potential increased
