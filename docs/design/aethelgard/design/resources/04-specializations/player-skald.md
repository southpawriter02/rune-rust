# The Skald — The Chronicler of Coherence

> *"A clear story is a wall. One story per room. Name what is true. Then move. These are not poetry lessons—they are survival doctrine. In a world whose own narrative has shattered into screaming nonsense, the only thing standing between your crew and panic is the voice that remembers what it means to be brave."*
> — Skald-Primus Ingrid, Gatehouse Training Manual

The **Skald** is not a mystic or a spellcaster.

They are a **coherence-keeper**.

In a world whose own story has been shattered into a screaming, incoherent mess, the Skald wields the one power capable of holding back the tide of anti-logical madness: *a coherent narrative*. Through epic poems and rousing battle-chants, they create temporary "narrative firewalls"—pockets of logic, heroism, and meaning that fortify allies' minds against the psychic static of the Great Silence or break enemies' morale with the weight of a foreseen doom.

Their philosophy is simple: the only way to fight a broken story is to tell a better one.

They are the keepers of what it means to be a hero in a world without one. Their voice is a weapon that imposes the logic of a saga onto the chaos of a glitch. Their own saga is a chronicle of every mind they've kept from shattering and every monster they've broken with the crushing weight of a well-told, undeniable truth.

To choose the Skald is to embrace the fantasy of the **inspirational leader and the keeper of legends**. You are the heart of the clan, the voice of your people, and the living memory of a shattered world.

## Core Philosophy: The Power of Story

### The Narrative Firewall

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Story as Shield** | A well-told tale creates a pocket of coherence that resists psychic noise |
| **Single Story Doctrine** | Choose one narrative through-line per engagement; do not split the tongue |
| **Truth Weight** | Do not promise glory you cannot pay; keep tragedies clean |
| **Circle-Craft** | Voice, cadence, and spatial arrangement create order from chaos |

The Skald's power comes from a fundamental truth about the post-Glitch world: **stories organize minds**. In an age where reality itself has become a recursive error message, a coherent narrative is not entertainment—it is survival technology.

> *"In Aethelgard, fear is not mere emotion—it is a contagion of incoherence. The Runic Blight weaponizes terror, using it to fragment minds. The Saga of Courage is a linguistic firewall, a story so compelling that it overwrites the corrupted fear response with tales of defiance."*

### The Coherent Path

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Coherent (no Corruption, no heretical costs) |
| **Risk Level** | Low (sustainable support role) |
| **Power Source** | Force of personality and narrative conviction, not Aetheric manipulation |
| **Social Function** | Sanity anchor, gate voice, crew index, counter-cant partner |

The Skald is one of the safest specializations in the Trauma Economy. Their power does not come from interfacing with corrupted Aether or channeling the Blight's entropy. It comes from the simple, profound act of **telling the right story at the right time**.

This makes them the ideal complement to high-risk specializations. Where the Echo-Caller burns their own sanity, where the Berserkr rides the edge of frenzy, where the Blót-Priest pays in blood—the Skald stands in the center and *steadies everyone*.

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Inspirational leader; the voice that holds the line |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Pure support class with powerful party-wide buffs and enemy debuffs |
| **Success Metric** | Allies never break; enemies falter under narrative weight |
| **Decision Space** | "Which Performance does this moment require?" |

Playing a Skald is about **tempo and song selection**.

Your gameplay loop:
- **Assess**: Read the battlefield—what does your party need right now?
- **Perform**: Initiate the appropriate Saga (party buff) or Dirge (enemy debuff)
- **Maintain**: Hold your Performance while the party exploits the advantage
- **Adapt**: When the situation changes, end one Performance and begin another

You are not a damage dealer. You have almost no personal offensive capability. Your success is measured entirely by how much more effective you make your allies and how much less effective you make your enemies.

> *"Playing a Skald is a game of tempo and choosing the right 'song' for the right moment in the battle."*

## Core Mechanics

### The Performance System

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Activation** | Standard Action + Stamina cost |
| **State** | Enters [Performing] status (channeled) |
| **Duration** | Rounds equal to WILL score |
| **Effect** | Aura affecting all allies or all enemies within earshot |
| **Limitation** | While [Performing], can move and use items but cannot take another Standard Action |
| **Interruption** | [Stunned] or [Silenced] ends Performance immediately |

The **Performance** mechanic is the Skald's defining feature. It is a channeled state that maintains powerful battlefield-wide effects for as long as the Skald keeps singing.

| Performance Type | Effect |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Sagas** | Party-wide buffs (Fear immunity, Stress resistance, Soak bonuses) |
| **Dirges** | Enemy-wide debuffs (Accuracy penalties, damage reduction, morale breaks) |

This creates meaningful tactical decisions: a Skald locked into Saga of Courage cannot simultaneously run Dirge of Defeat. Choosing the right Performance for the situation is the core of Skald gameplay.

### Circle-Craft

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Function** | Voice, cadence, and spatial arrangement creating pockets of order |
| **Application** | Gather allies into hearing arc; set cadence with shield-rim or heel |
| **Site Selection** | Prefer convex walls, low-echo materials; avoid mirrored surfaces |
| **Counter-Cant** | Structured utterances that disrupt hostile chants without Galdr |

The Skald's power extends beyond combat into **circle-craft**—the art of using voice and spatial arrangement to create stability. A Skald at a gate can dissolve rumor spirals. A Skald in a market can prevent stampedes. A Skald in a hall can synchronize breathing and prevent panic.

> *"Circle the breath. Gather allies into a hearing arc. Set cadence with shield-rim or heel."*

### The Name-Ledger

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Function** | Maintained register of routes, oaths, persons, and debts carried in verse |
| **Application** | Operational recall under stress; attribution discipline |
| **Maintenance** | Recite names and oaths nightly; update pronunciations and debts |
| **Ethics** | Never borrow a tale you cannot carry true; cite origins |

The Skald carries the **name-ledger**—the memory of routes, beasts, oaths, and deeds that crews depend on for operational recall. In a world where written records are unreliable and digital storage is corrupted, the Skald's trained memory is infrastructure.

## Abilities: The Repertoire of a Legend

### Tier 1 — Foundational Performance

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Oral Tradition I** | Passive | — | +1→2 dice to Rhetoric checks and historical lore investigation; Rank 3 auto-recall |
| **Saga of Courage** | Performance | 40 Stamina | All allies IMMUNE to [Feared] + +1→2 dice to WILL Resolve vs Psychic Stress |
| **Dirge of Defeat** | Performance | 40 Stamina | All intelligent enemies suffer -1→2 dice to Accuracy and damage |

**Oral Tradition I** is the foundational passive. The great sagas are part of the Skald's very being, carried in verse and cadence. You gain bonus dice to Rhetoric checks (making you the party's natural "face") and to investigation checks for historical lore.

**Saga of Courage** is your signature defensive Performance. You begin a rousing chant—a tale of a hero who stood against overwhelming odds and did not falter. While performing, all allies are immune to [Feared] and gain bonus dice to resist Psychic Stress.

> *"The Skald begins to recite the Saga of the Unbroken—a chronicle of heroes who faced the horrors of the Glitch and did not flinch. The words themselves seem to push back against the Great Silence, creating a bubble of narrative coherence where fear cannot take root."*

**Dirge of Defeat** is your signature offensive debuff. Your voice drops to a low, sorrowful dirge, recounting a tale of a great army that marched to its doom. Intelligent enemies suffer penalties to Accuracy and damage as their morale falters under the weight of foreseen failure.

### Tier 2 — Advanced Composition

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Rousing Verse** | Active | 35 Stamina | NOT a Performance. Instantly restore 15+(WILL×2)→25+(WILL×3) Stamina to single ally |
| **Song of Silence** | Active | 45 Stamina | Opposed WILL+Rhetoric vs enemy. Success: apply [Silenced] for 2→3 rounds |
| **Enduring Performance** | Passive | — | All Performance durations +2→4 rounds; Rank 3 allows 2 simultaneous Performances |

**Rousing Verse** is your instant utility. Unlike other abilities, this is NOT a Performance—it's a quick, sharp verse that instantly restores Stamina to a single ally. Critical for keeping high-Stamina fighters in the fight.

> *"The Skald speaks a quick, sharp verse from a saga about a tireless warrior, banishing fatigue through structured recollection."*

**Song of Silence** is your anti-caster tool. You begin a complex, counter-resonant chant designed to choke a spellcaster's words in their throat. Success inflicts [Silenced]—one of the most powerful debuffs in the game, preventing all verbal abilities.

**Enduring Performance** extends your core mechanic. All Performance durations increase by +2/3/4 rounds. At Rank 3, you can maintain TWO Performances simultaneously (requiring both Stamina costs and two Standard Actions to initiate).

### Tier 3 — Mastery of the Saga

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Lay of the Iron Wall** | Performance | 55 Stamina | All Front Row allies gain +2→4 Soak; Rank 3 adds Push/Pull resistance |
| **Heart of the Clan** | Passive | — | All allies in same row gain +1→2 dice to defensive Resolve Checks; Rank 3 extends to adjacent row |

**Lay of the Iron Wall** is your tank-enablement Performance. You tell the story of the unbreakable shield wall at the Battle of the Black Pass. Your allies are so inspired by the tale they become the wall of the saga, gaining significant Soak bonuses.

> *"The Skald tells the story of the unbreakable shield wall. Narrative imposes structural coherence on formation."*

**Heart of the Clan** is your passive aura. You are the living heart of your clan. Your mere presence is a source of unshakeable resolve. Allies in your row gain bonus dice to all defensive Resolve Checks—fear, disorientation, psychic assault.

### Capstone — Saga of the Einherjar

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Cost** | 75 Stamina |
| **Frequency** | Once per combat |
| **Duration** | WILL rounds |
| **Effect** | All allies gain [Inspired] (+3→5 dice to damage) + 20→40 temporary HP |
| **Immunity** | Rank 3: Allies immune to [Feared] and [Stunned] during Performance |
| **Backlash** | When Performance ends, all affected allies take 10→6 Psychic Stress |

The capstone **Saga of the Einherjar** is your masterpiece—a booming, epic saga of the greatest heroes of old. Your voice is filled with such power that, for a few moments, the broken reality of the Blight is completely overwritten by the heroic reality of the saga. Your allies do not just feel like heroes; they **become** them.

> *"The Skald unleashes their masterpiece. Their voice is filled with such power that their allies believe themselves to be those very heroes."*

All allies gain massive damage bonuses and temporary HP. At Rank 3, they're immune to [Feared] and [Stunned] for the duration.

But heroism has a cost. When the saga ends, the abrupt return to the world's true, horrific state is a psychic shock. All affected allies suffer Psychic Stress as the narrative firewall collapses.

## Systemic Integration

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Source | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Saga of Courage** | Prevents [Feared]; reduces incoming Psychic Stress |
| **Heart of the Clan** | Bonus dice to defensive Resolve Checks |
| **Saga of the Einherjar** | Complete Stress immunity during; Stress cost after |
| **Baseline** | Low risk—no self-inflicted Corruption or Stress |

The Skald is the **proactive defense** against the Trauma Economy. Where the Bone-Setter heals Stress after it accumulates, the Skald prevents it from accumulating in the first place.

### Mitigation Role

| Tool | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Fear Immunity** | Saga of Courage completely blocks [Feared] |
| **Stress Resistance** | Multiple abilities provide bonus dice to Resolve Checks |
| **Counter-Cant** | Song of Silence disrupts hostile chants and Galdr |
| **Morale Break** | Dirge of Defeat weakens enemy effectiveness |

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Skjaldmær** | Combined Psychic Stress reduction makes party nearly immune to mental damage |
| **Berserkr** | Saga of Courage allows Berserkr to fight without fear penalties despite low WILL |
| **Echo-Caller** | Counter-cant grounds witnesses; covers Echo-Caller's high-Stress projections |
| **Bone-Setter** | Complementary roles—Skald prevents Stress, Bone-Setter heals it |
| **Galdr-Caster** | Counter-cant and Song of Silence protect chant windows |

> *"The Skald is the proactive counterpart to the Bone-Setter's reactive Stress healing."*

The Skald has incredible synergy with glass cannon builds and high-risk specializations. A Berserkr with a Skald behind them can rage without fear. An Echo-Caller with a Skald can project without watching their own Stress.

### Counter-Synergies

| Situation | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| **[Silenced]** | All Performances end immediately; cannot use most abilities |
| **[Stunned]** | All Performances end immediately |
| **Mindless enemies** | Dirge of Defeat has no effect on beasts and Undying |
| **Solo play** | Almost no personal damage output; relies entirely on party |

The Skald's greatest vulnerability is being silenced. A [Silenced] Skald is nearly useless—all Performances end, and most abilities require speech. Protecting the Skald from Silence effects is a party priority.

## Lore Integration

### Historical Development

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| **Pre-Glitch** | Entertainment and cultural transmission |
| **Post-Glitch Crisis** | Communities stabilized around voices that synchronized breath and recollection |
| **Reader Codification** | Ledgers note skaldic patterns reducing panic and stampede incidence at gates |
| **Modern Practice** | Formalized repertoires: courage lays, dirges, oath-verses, blocking songs |

The Skald tradition evolved from post-Glitch necessity. When communities faced psychic assault and reality breakdown, they discovered that certain voices could hold minds together. Reader governance formalized these patterns into reproducible doctrine.

### Social Functions

| Function | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| **Sanity Anchor** | Stories organize breathing and thought, reducing drift after anomaly contact |
| **Gate Voice** | Speaks clean facts, then shapes endings at councils and crossings |
| **Crew Index** | Carries memory of routes, beasts, oaths, and deeds for operational recall |
| **Counter-Cant Partner** | Works beside Galdr-Casters to preserve windows, Bone-Setters to lower CPS onset |

The Skald is not just a combat support—they are civic infrastructure. A Skald at a gate can dissolve rumor spirals before they become riots. A Skald in a market can prevent stampedes. A Skald on the road carries the memory that keeps crews alive.

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Jötun-Readers** | Recognize sagas as the only surviving record of many historical events |
| **Rust-Clans** | Protect Skalds fiercely; stories defragment their cluttered drives |
| **Kaupmaðr** | Essential for market calm; work with Skalds to close terms without blood |
| **Iron-Banes** | Appreciate coherent doctrine; Skalds carry the hymns of purification |
| **Rune-Lupins** | A well-told story acts as defragmentation; packs will protect a Skald |

The Rune-Lupins (Vargr-Syn) have a unique relationship with Skalds: their fractured minds find that a well-told story acts as a defragmentation algorithm for cluttered drives. A pack will protect a Skald as fiercely as their own young.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the songs, they are the voice-bearers, the memory-keepers, the ones who learned to fight the screaming chaos with nothing but words and conviction. When the world's own story shattered into madness, they found a way to tell a better one—and in the telling, reality bent toward the shape of their saga. They stand in the center of the shield wall and sing of unbreakable courage, and somehow, impossibly, the wall holds. They recite the doom of enemy armies, and somehow, impossibly, those armies falter. They are the heart of every clan, the voice of every gate, the memory of every road. When the Great Silence howls, they howl back with tales of heroes who did not flinch—and in the space between the screams, their stories become true."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Skald (Chronicler of Coherence) represents the Coherent Adept specialization optimized for party-wide buff/debuff support and Trauma Economy mitigation. Mechanical role: pure support with Performance-based channeled effects. Key differentiator: provides Fear immunity and Stress resistance without self-cost; one of the safest specializations. Core mechanic: Performance (channeled state lasting WILL rounds, ends on Silence/Stun). Signature ability: Saga of the Einherjar (once per combat, massive party damage bonus + temporary HP, Stress cost on end). Trauma Economy interaction: Low risk—proactive Stress prevention complements Bone-Setter's reactive healing. Optimal deployment: parties with high-risk damage dealers, encounters with Fear effects, situations requiring sustained morale support. Requires protection from Silence effects."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Skald (Chronicler of Coherence). ARCHETYPE: Adept. PATH TYPE: Coherent (Low Trauma Risk). ROLE: Morale Officer / Buffer / Debuffer / Living Encyclopedia. PRIMARY STAT: WILL. SECONDARY STAT: WITS. RESOURCE: Stamina. CORE MECHANICS: Performance System (channeled state, WILL rounds duration, Standard Action + Stamina), Sagas (party buffs), Dirges (enemy debuffs), Counter-Cant (anti-caster utility). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Performance): Oral Tradition I, Saga of Courage, Dirge of Defeat. T2 (Advanced Composition): Rousing Verse, Song of Silence, Enduring Performance. T3 (Mastery of the Saga): Lay of the Iron Wall, Heart of the Clan. CAPSTONE: Saga of the Einherjar (75 Stamina, once per combat, +3-5 damage dice + 20-40 temp HP to all allies, 10-6 Stress cost on end). SYNERGIES: Skjaldmær (stacked Stress reduction), Berserkr (Fear immunity for low-WILL fighters), Bone-Setter (complementary Stress management), Galdr-Caster (chant protection). COUNTERS: [Silenced] (ends all Performances), [Stunned], mindless enemies (immune to Dirge), solo play (no personal damage)."*

## Summary

The Skald is the **narrative anchor** of Aethelgard.

Where others fight the Great Silence with weapons and magic, the Skald fights with story. Their Performances create battlefield-wide effects—Sagas that make allies immune to Fear and resistant to Psychic Stress, Dirges that break enemy morale and cripple their effectiveness.

Their power is entirely party-focused. A Skald has almost no personal damage output. Their success is measured by how much more effective they make their allies and how much less effective they make their enemies. They are the ultimate team player.

The Performance mechanic creates meaningful tactical decisions. While channeling Saga of Courage, you cannot also run Dirge of Defeat. Choosing the right song for the moment—and knowing when to end one Performance to begin another—is the core of Skald gameplay.

They are one of the safest specializations in the Trauma Economy. Their power does not come from corrupted Aether or heretical bargains. It comes from the simple, profound act of telling the right story at the right time.

But they are vulnerable. A [Silenced] Skald is nearly useless—all Performances end, and most abilities require speech. The party must protect their voice.

Their capstone, Saga of the Einherjar, is the ultimate expression of their art: a saga so powerful that reality bends to match it. For a few glorious rounds, allies become the heroes of legend—but when the song ends, the return to truth is a psychic shock.

*A clear story is a wall.*
*One story per room.*
*Name what is true.*
*Then move.*
