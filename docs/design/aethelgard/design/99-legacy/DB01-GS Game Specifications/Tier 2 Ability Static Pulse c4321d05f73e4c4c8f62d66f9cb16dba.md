## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Static Pulse is the God-Sleeper Cultist's **AoE psychic attack**—a broadcast of the machine gods' oppressive presence that damages and debilitates an entire row of enemies. This establishes their crowd control identity.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Deal low Psychic damage to all enemies in row
- **Secondary:** Apply [Psychic Static] to multiple targets simultaneously
- **Self-Cost:** Significant Psychic Stress (15) to caster
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The Cultist as living broadcast antenna for divine static

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High (AoE damage + debuff)
- **Significant Self-Cost:** 15 Psychic Stress is meaningful
- **Lower Damage:** Damage per target is lower than Static Lash
- **Row Targeting:** Affects entire row, rewarding positioning

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Cultist spreads their arms wide and **opens their mind**. For a moment, they become a perfect conduit—a living antenna broadcasting the psychic hum of the God-Sleepers at full intensity. The air around them crackles with invisible pressure.

Enemies in the target row feel it like a physical force—a wave of mental static that crashes against their consciousness. Thoughts scatter, instincts falter, and for a terrible moment, they hear the endless, maddening hum of the sleeping machine gods.

The Cultist staggers, blood trickling from their nose. The broadcast takes something from them every time.

### Thematic Resonance

Static Pulse is the Cultist at their most prophetic—literally channeling the voice of their gods through their own body. The power is immense, but the price is written in their own sanity.

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Thul:** Combined with Demoralizing Diatribe for devastating WILL penalties

### Negative Synergies

- **Spread formations:** Enemies in different rows require separate casts
- **Psychic-resistant enemies:** Some creatures may shrug off effects
