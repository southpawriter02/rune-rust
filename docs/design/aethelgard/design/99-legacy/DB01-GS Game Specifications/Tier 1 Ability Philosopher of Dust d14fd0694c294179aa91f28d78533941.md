## Description

You have an intuitive understanding of decay and structural failure. You look at a gleaming war-machine and see not its current form, but the inevitable path of its collapse. You perceive the weak welds, the stress fractures, the points where metal will fail first. You see not what is, but what will be: rust, ruin, and dust.
