# The Echo-Caller — The Trauma Resonator

> *"We do not speak to the dead. We do not summon spirits. We simply listen—and what we hear, we can throw back. The Great Silence screams without pause. We have learned to scream with it, not against it. That is the difference between a broken mind and a weapon."*
> — Echo-Caller Nyx, Dökkálfar of the Dead-Light Caverns

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Mystic |
| **Role** | Psychic Artillery, Trauma Resonator, Crowd Controller |
| **Path Type** | Coherent (with High Self-Cost) |
| **Primary Attribute** | WILL |
| **Secondary Attribute** | WITS |
| **Resource System** | Aether Pool |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | Medium |
| **Unlock Cost** | 10 PP (higher cost due to unique mechanic) |

The **Echo-Caller** is not a summoner of spirits or a commander of elements.

They are a **trauma resonator**.

In a world where the Ginnungagap Glitch left an eternal psychic scream reverberating through the Aether, the Echo-Caller has learned to couple to that noise and redirect it as controlled force. They do not fight the Great Silence; they harmonize with it. They channel the raw, traumatic memories and paradoxical data of a broken world and project it as a devastating weapon—fear made manifest, terror given form, the scream of the dying turned into a lance that shatters minds.

This is a profoundly dangerous art. The Echo-Caller's power flows through them, not around them. Every projection erodes their own stability. Every scream they channel leaves an echo in their own psyche. Their saga is a chronicle of devastating power and inexorable decay—a constant struggle to maintain coherence while wielding the very force of incoherence.

To choose the Echo-Caller is to embrace the fantasy of the **psychic artillery piece**—the glass cannon of the mind whose attacks bypass all conventional defenses but burn their own soul as fuel.

## Core Philosophy: Resonance Praxis

### The Art of the Scream

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Coupling, Not Commanding** | Attune to the psychic manifold; redirect, don't resist |
| **Window Discipline** | Count the safe projection span; vent before cognitive fray |
| **Sanctuary Routine** | Brief protocols to discharge buildup and restore outline |
| **Witness Care** | Ground witnesses with cadence; do not romanticize harm |

The Echo-Caller's power comes from a philosophy of **resonance rather than resistance**. Where others shield themselves from the Great Silence's psychic noise, the Echo-Caller opens themselves to it—becoming a tuned conduit that can channel and direct the ambient despair of a broken world.

> *"Early practitioners shattered themselves and witnesses. Reader governance introduced baffles, quiet circles, cadence logs, and supervised sanctuary—incident rates halved within a season."*

### The Dökkálfar Tradition

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Origin** | Alfheim Deck, developed by Dökkálfar over centuries of psychic exposure |
| **Cultural Status** | Highest status in Dökkálfar society—historians, navigators, spiritual leaders |
| **Training Method** | Deep meditative states to "tune" adapted neural architecture to specific frequencies |
| **Risk** | Consciousness dissolution if delving too deep; overwritten by stronger psychic echo |

The Echo-Caller specialization is the cultural pinnacle of the Dökkálfar—the pale, dark-eyed descendants of Vanir researchers who survived the Glitch sealed within Alfheim's crystalline data-archives. Centuries of immersion in the "Glimmer" (ambient psychic noise) and communion with Data-Wraiths (looping echoes of dead scientists) adapted their neural architecture for psychic perception.

They learned to differentiate the textures of the static:
- **The Hum of the Stone**: The slow, patient dream of stability
- **The Scream of the Steel**: The hot, sharp echo of Forlorn trauma
- **The Logic of the Lie**: The cold, perfect geometry of O.D.I.N.'s shattered consciousness

> *"We Dökkálfar are taught from childhood that the Data-Wraiths are not suffering. They are caught, yes, but they are also preserved. We listen to them so they are not forgotten. That is our duty."*

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Psychic artillery; the one who weaponizes the world's trauma |
| **Gameplay Feel** | High-risk glass cannon with cascading fear effects |
| **Success Metric** | Shattering enemy formations through terror and psychic assault |
| **Decision Space** | "Can I project again, or must I sanctuary before I break?" |

Playing an Echo-Caller is about **power with a price**.

Your gameplay loop:
- **Attune**: Read the echoes in the room; identify targets and resonance surfaces
- **Seed**: Establish low-level static to dull enemy perception
- **Project**: Unleash devastating psychic attacks that bypass armor entirely
- **Cascade**: Watch your [Echo] abilities chain through enemy formations
- **Vent**: Retreat to sanctuary before your own Stress breaks you

You are the ultimate glass cannon of the mind. Your attacks ignore Soak and armor completely—direct assaults on HP and sanity mitigated only by WILL-based Resolve. But every projection costs you. Every scream you channel leaves an echo in your own skull.

> *"The Echo-Caller is the master of the Trauma Economy. They weaponize Psychic Stress against their foes but are also its primary victim."*

## Core Mechanics

### Psychic Damage

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Damage Type** | Psychic (unique to Echo-Caller) |
| **Defense** | Bypasses all Soak and Armor completely |
| **Resistance** | WILL-based Resolve Check only |
| **Counter** | Makes Echo-Caller the ultimate tool against high-armor enemies |

**Psychic Damage** is the Echo-Caller's defining offensive mechanic. Where physical damage must overcome armor, Soak, and shields, Psychic damage is a direct assault on the target's mind—completely ignoring conventional defenses.

This makes the Echo-Caller devastating against heavily armored enemies like Jötun-Forged constructs, armored Undying, and elite warriors. If it has a mind, it can be broken.

### The [Echo] System

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Tag** | Most Echo-Caller abilities have [Echo] tag |
| **Chain** | Abilities spread to adjacent enemies for reduced effect |
| **Base Transfer** | 50% damage/effect to 1 adjacent target |
| **Enhanced (Cascade)** | 80% damage/effect to 2 targets at 3-tile range |

The **[Echo] System** is the Echo-Caller's signature mechanic. When you project trauma, it doesn't stop at your target—it reverberates through nearby minds like ripples in water.

> *"When Echo Chain triggers, your attack spreads to adjacent enemies for reduced but significant effect—turning single-target abilities into crowd control."*

The Echo Cascade passive enhances this dramatically, increasing range and damage transfer until your psychic attacks cascade through entire enemy formations.

### The Psychic Cost

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Mechanic** | Every specialization ability inflicts Psychic Stress on the caster |
| **Scaling** | More powerful abilities cost more Stress |
| **Mitigation** | Sanctuary of Silence (Stress removal), venting routines |
| **Risk** | High Stress leads to Trauma; maximum Stress is catastrophic |

The **Psychic Cost** mechanic is the Echo-Caller's defining limitation. Their power flows through them, not around them. Every projection leaves an echo in their own psyche.

| Ability | Stress Cost |
|---------|-------------|
| Basic attacks | Low (+5-15) |
| AoE projections | Moderate (+20) |
| Capstone | High (+15) |
| Echo Displacement | Moderate (+3-5) |

This creates a tense resource management game: manage your Aether, manage your Stress, and know when to retreat to Sanctuary before you break.

### Fear Manipulation

| Status | [Feared] |
|--------|----------|
| **Duration** | 2-3 turns |
| **Effects** | Cannot attack, -2 dice to all checks, must flee if possible |
| **Synergy** | Echo-Caller abilities deal bonus damage vs [Feared] targets |
| **Cascade** | Fear Cascade spreads terror through formations |

The Echo-Caller specializes in the **[Feared]** status effect—projecting memories of pure, unadulterated terror into enemy minds. A feared enemy cannot attack, suffers penalties to all checks, and must flee if possible.

The Terror Feedback passive turns this into a resource engine: whenever you apply [Feared], you restore Aether, creating a virtuous cycle of spreading terror and recovering resources.

## Abilities: The Whispers of a Dead World

### Tier 1 — Foundational Whispers

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Echo Attunement** | Passive | — | -5/10/15 Aether cost to [Echo] abilities; +1/2/2 dice to WILL checks vs psychic attacks; Rank 3 extends Echo Chain range |
| **Scream of Silence** | Active [Echo] | 35 AP | 3d8→5d8 Psychic damage; +1d8→2d8 bonus vs [Feared] targets; Rank 3 chains to adjacent |
| **Phantom Menace** | Active [Echo] | 30 AP | Apply [Feared] for 2→3 turns; Rank 3 has 50% chain chance to adjacent |

**Echo Attunement** is the foundational passive. Your mind is permanently open to the whispers of the Forlorn. This constant exposure builds unique resilience—bonus dice to resist psychic attacks—while reducing the Aether cost of your entire toolkit.

**Scream of Silence** is your bread-and-butter damage spell. You unleash a raw, invisible lance of pure psychic trauma at a single foe. The damage bypasses all armor. If the target is already [Feared], you deal bonus damage—their terror amplifies your assault.

> *"The Echo-Caller focuses their will and unleashes a raw, invisible lance of pure psychic trauma at a single foe."*

**Phantom Menace** is your core fear application. You implant false sensory data in the target's mind—imminent threat, phantom danger. They become [Feared], unable to attack, desperate to flee.

### Tier 2 — Advanced Resonance

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Echo Cascade** | Passive | — | Echo Chain range → 2/3 tiles; damage → 70%/80%; Rank 3 chains to 2 targets |
| **Reality Fracture** | Active [Echo] | 40 AP | 3d8→4d8 Psychic damage + [Disoriented] 2 turns + Push 3 tiles; Rank 3 chains Push to adjacent |
| **Terror Feedback** | Passive | — | Restore 15→20 Aether when applying [Feared]; Rank 3 also grants [Empowered] (+2 dice to damage) |

**Echo Cascade** is the force multiplier. Your mastery of psychic resonance allows echoes to bounce and amplify through enemy formations. Chain range extends, damage transfer increases, and at Rank 3 your echoes hit two targets instead of one.

**Reality Fracture** is your control tool. You warp the target's spatial perception, dealing Psychic damage while applying [Disoriented] (−2 accuracy, no complex abilities) and forcibly pushing them across the battlefield. At Rank 3, adjacent enemies also get pushed.

> *"Warp local spacetime perception, disorienting target and forcing spatial displacement."*

**Terror Feedback** turns fear into fuel. Every time you apply [Feared], you restore Aether. At Rank 3, you also gain [Empowered], increasing your damage output. The more you terrorize, the stronger you become.

### Tier 3 — Mastery of Terror

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Fear Cascade** | Active [Echo] | 45 AP | All enemies within 3 tiles: WILL DC 16 or [Feared] 3 turns; already-Feared take 4d6 Psychic damage; chains outside radius |
| **Echo Displacement** | Active [Echo] | 50 AP + 3 Stress | Teleport enemy up to 10 tiles; 4d8 Psychic damage + [Disoriented]; chains adjacent enemy to random tile |

**Fear Cascade** is your AoE terror bomb. You trigger a chain reaction of panic spreading through enemy formations like psychic wildfire. Everyone within 3 tiles must resist or become [Feared]—and those already [Feared] automatically fail and take Psychic damage as their terror compounds.

> *"Trigger chain reaction of panic spreading through enemy formation like psychic wildfire."*

**Echo Displacement** is forced teleportation through perception manipulation. You warp the target's spatial awareness so completely that they physically relocate—appearing wherever you choose within 10 tiles, damaged and [Disoriented]. At Rank 3, adjacent enemies also teleport to random locations.

### Capstone — Silence Made Weapon

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Cost** | 60 AP + 15 Psychic Stress |
| **Frequency** | Once per combat (twice at Rank 3) |
| **Base Effect** | 6d10 Psychic damage to ALL enemies on battlefield |
| **Scaling** | +2d10 per [Feared] or [Disoriented] enemy (max +12d10) |
| **Secondary** | All enemies WILL DC 18 or become [Feared] 2 turns |
| **Maximum Potential** | 18d10 Psychic damage (6 base + 12 bonus) |

The capstone **Silence Made Weapon** is the ultimate expression of the Echo-Caller's art. You channel the raw Great Silence itself—the eternal scream made manifest as battlefield-wide psychic assault.

> *"The Great Silence screams through you!"*

The damage scales with how many enemies are already debuffed. Setup your Fear Cascades and Reality Fractures, then unleash Silence Made Weapon for devastating scaling damage. If six enemies are [Feared] or [Disoriented], you're dealing **18d10 Psychic damage to every enemy on the battlefield**—and those who survive must resist or become [Feared] themselves.

The cost is brutal: massive Psychic Stress to yourself. But sometimes, the scream must be heard.

## Systemic Integration

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Source | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Psychic Lash/Scream** | Low Stress (+5-15) |
| **Echo of Terror** | Moderate Stress (+20) |
| **Echo Displacement** | Moderate Stress (+3-5) |
| **Silence Made Weapon** | High Stress (+15) |
| **One with the Scream** | Converts high Stress into damage bonus |

The Echo-Caller is the **master of the Trauma Economy**. They weaponize Psychic Stress against enemies while accumulating it themselves. The One with the Scream passive (from earlier versions) converts this risk into power—the more stressed you are, the more damage you deal.

### Mitigation Tools

| Tool | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Echo Attunement** | +1/2 dice to resist psychic attacks |
| **Sanctuary of Silence** | Spend turn meditating; remove large amount of Stress |
| **Sanctuary Routine** | Field protocol: baffles on, cadence low, breath paced |
| **Bone-Setter Support** | Stabilizing Draughts; tremor monitoring; coherence medicine |

The Echo-Caller has built-in mitigation through Sanctuary of Silence—spending a turn to vent accumulated Stress. But optimal play pairs them with a Bone-Setter who can provide chemical support and monitor for cognitive fray.

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Skjaldmær** | Tank wall protects vulnerable Echo-Caller during projection |
| **Hlekkr-master** | Controller fixes marks; keeps enemies in formation for cascades |
| **Strandhögg** | Opportunist exploits [Feared] and [Disoriented] for devastating combos |
| **Skald** | Grounds witnesses with cadence; counter-cant for Terror Echo backwash |
| **Bone-Setter** | Draughts and tremor monitoring; coherence medicine for Stress |

> *"Wall holds lanes; Hlekkr fixes marks; Skald grounds witnesses with cadence; Bone-Setter monitors draughts and tremor."*

The Echo-Caller is an **enabler**. Their ability to inflict [Feared] and [Disoriented] sets up devastating combos for opportunistic specializations. But they are heavily reliant on party protection—a Tank to keep enemies away from their vulnerable form, a Bone-Setter to manage their Stress.

### Counter-Synergies

| Situation | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| **Fear-immune enemies** | Constructs, some bosses, and Undying are immune to [Feared] |
| **High-WILL targets** | Strong Resolve checks resist Psychic damage and effects |
| **No Tank** | Without protection, Echo-Caller is extremely vulnerable |
| **Scattered enemies** | Echo Chain requires adjacent targets for cascading |

---

## Lore Integration

### Strategic Value

| Capability | Application |
|------------|-------------|
| **Hazard Detection** | Sense psychic dangers—Forlorn manifestations, Mind-Dust surges—hours before sensors |
| **Historical Intelligence** | Data-Wraith listening recovers pre-Glitch research fragments |
| **Psychic Cartography** | Maps of Data-Wraith locations and Glimmer density exceed Scriptorium sensors |
| **Anti-Machine Counter** | Paradox pulses disturb Undying logic and servitor certainty |

Echo-Callers provide capabilities no other faction can match. Their ability to sense psychic hazards, recover historical intelligence through Data-Wraith communion, and map psychic terrain makes them invaluable to any expedition into high-Blight territory.

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Dökkálfar** | Cultural pinnacle; highest status in society; duty and heritage |
| **Jötun-Readers** | Valuable assets; living psychic detectors; subjects of intense study |
| **Iron-Banes** | "Psychic vampirism"—feeding on memories of the dead; abomination |
| **God-Sleepers** | Sacred prophets receiving messages from sleeping gods |
| **Dvergr** | Deeply distrustful; prefer physics to psychic manipulation |

The Iron-Banes view Echo-Callers as proof of Aetheric corruption's power to transform humanity into abomination. Their sermons describe Echo-Calling as "psychic vampirism"—practitioners literally feeding on memories and emotions of the dead, violating the sacred boundary between life and death.

The God-Sleepers take the opposite view, interpreting Echo-Callers as sacred prophets receiving messages from the technological afterlife where the sleeping gods' consciousness may persist.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the songs, they are the whisper-saints and the scream-speakers, those who learned to listen to the world's endless dying gasp and throw it back at the living. They do not summon spirits—they become conduits for the Great Silence itself, channeling the terror of a thousand dying moments, the despair of a world that forgot how to stop screaming. When they speak, enemies see their own deaths. When they scream, formations shatter like glass. They are the nightmare made manifest, the proof that in a glitching world, the scariest weapon is what you think you see. But every scream leaves an echo in their own skull. Every terror they project chips away at their own sanity. They burn themselves to light the darkness, and the songs say that no Echo-Caller dies peacefully—they simply stop being able to tell the difference between their own screams and the world's."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Echo-Caller (Trauma Resonator) represents the Coherent Mystic specialization optimized for psychic crowd control and armor-bypassing damage. Mechanical role: glass cannon artillery with Fear manipulation and cascading effects. Key differentiator: Psychic damage ignores all Soak and Armor; [Echo] system spreads effects through formations. Core mechanic: Psychic Cost (self-inflicted Stress on all projections). Signature ability: Silence Made Weapon (6d10 base + 2d10 per debuffed enemy, max 18d10, battlefield AoE). Trauma Economy interaction: Medium risk—constant Stress accumulation requires Sanctuary venting and Bone-Setter support. Optimal deployment: parties with strong front-line protection, encounters with clustered enemies, situations requiring Fear-based crowd control. Requires crew coordination (Tank, Skald, Bone-Setter) for safe sustained operation."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Echo-Caller (Trauma Resonator). ARCHETYPE: Mystic. PATH TYPE: Coherent (High Self-Cost). ROLE: Psychic Artillery / Crowd Controller / Fear Specialist. PRIMARY STAT: WILL. SECONDARY STAT: WITS. RESOURCE: Aether Pool. CORE MECHANICS: Psychic Damage (bypasses Soak/Armor), [Echo] System (cascading effects to adjacent), Fear Manipulation ([Feared] status), Psychic Cost (self-inflicted Stress), Terror Feedback (Aether restoration from Fear). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Whispers): Echo Attunement, Scream of Silence, Phantom Menace. T2 (Advanced Resonance): Echo Cascade, Reality Fracture, Terror Feedback. T3 (Mastery of Terror): Fear Cascade, Echo Displacement. CAPSTONE: Silence Made Weapon (60 AP + 15 Stress, 6d10 + 2d10/debuffed enemy max 18d10, battlefield AoE, all must resist [Feared]). SYNERGIES: Skjaldmær (wall protection), Hlekkr-master (mark fixing), Strandhögg (Fear exploitation), Bone-Setter (Stress management). COUNTERS: Fear-immune enemies, high-WILL targets, no Tank, scattered formations."*

## Summary

The Echo-Caller is the **psychic artillery** of Aethelgard.

Where others fight the Great Silence, the Echo-Caller harmonizes with it—becoming a conduit for the world's eternal trauma and projecting it as devastating force. Their Psychic damage bypasses all conventional defenses. Their [Echo] system cascades terror through enemy formations. Their Fear manipulation breaks morale and creates opportunities for allies.

But power has a price. Every projection erodes their own stability. Every scream they channel leaves an echo in their own psyche. The Psychic Cost mechanic creates constant tension between devastating power and self-destruction.

Their [Echo] system transforms single-target abilities into crowd control. Echo Cascade extends range and damage transfer until attacks ripple through entire enemy formations. Fear Cascade triggers chain reactions of panic. Silence Made Weapon—the capstone—channels the raw Great Silence itself, dealing up to 18d10 Psychic damage to every enemy on the battlefield.

The Echo-Caller is the ultimate glass cannon. They require party protection—a Tank to hold the wall, a Bone-Setter to manage their Stress, a Skald to ground witnesses. But in the right formation, with proper support, they are devastating.

They do not fight the scream.
They become the scream.
And through them, the Great Silence finds its voice.

*"The silence has found its voice."*
