# Hlekkr-master (Chain-Master) — Specialization Specification v5.0

## I. Core Philosophy: The Exploiter of System Lag

The **Hlekkr-master** is the Skirmisher specialization that engineers space. Using nets, hooks, and chain geometry, you convert lanes, thresholds, and chokepoints into a machine that removes enemy choice. You are the battlefield puppeteer who exploits glitching physics to drag enemies into kill zones, lock them down, and punish helplessness.

To choose the Hlekkr-master is to embrace the philosophy that **position is everything**. Your saga is written in displaced enemies, broken formations, and the chains that bind chaos to your will. You don't fight enemies—you move them where they need to die.

---

## II. Player-Facing Presentation

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Role** | Battlefield Controller, Formation Breaker, Positional Manipulator |
| **Primary Attribute** | FINESSE (for accuracy with hooks and chains) |
| **Secondary Attribute** | MIGHT (for forced movement strength) |
| **Resource** | Stamina |
| **Trauma Risk** | Low (one ability has minor Stress cost) |

### Gameplay Feel

The Hlekkr-master is a **tactical controller** whose damage is low but whose impact is immense. Your combat loop is:

1. **Assess**: Identify the keystone—the body whose removal collapses the enemy shape
2. **Root**: Fix the front line with nets to prevent pursuit
3. **Pull**: Drag back-row priority targets (casters, archers) into melee with hooks
4. **Punish**: Convert control into damage via Punish the Helpless

You see corrupted enemies not as threats but as **glitching code to exploit**—their unstable connection to reality makes them easier to yank around. The more corrupted, the more controllable.

### The Trade-Off

Your personal damage is minimal. You create the **conditions** where fights cannot be lost, relying on allies to capitalize on your positioning. Solo, you struggle; with a coordinated party, you're devastating.

## III. Mechanical Implementation

### A. Core Mechanic: Forced Movement (Pull/Push)

**Grappling Hook Toss** pulls enemies from Back Row to Front Row:

- Only works on Standard-size enemies (Large/Huge immune)
- Pulled targets become [Disoriented] (1 turn)
- **Master of Puppets** passive: Pulled enemies also become [Vulnerable]

### B. Core Mechanic: Corruption Exploitation

**Snag the Glitch** increases control success rate vs corrupted enemies:

| Corruption Level | Control Success Bonus | Rank 2 (Doubled) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Low (1-29) | +10% | +20% |
| Medium (30-59) | +20% | +40% |
| High (60-89) | +40% | +80% |
| Extreme (90+) | +60% | +100% (cannot miss) |

### C. Core Mechanic: Control-to-Damage Conversion

**Punish the Helpless** converts control effects into party damage amplification:

- +50%/+75%/+100% damage vs [Rooted], [Slowed], [Stunned], [Seized], or [Disoriented] targets
- Your chains don't just lock down—they make enemies die faster

## V. Systemic Integration

### Trauma Economy

- **Coherent Specialization**: No heretical mechanics
- **Corruption Siphon Chain** is the only ability with Psychic Stress cost (5 → 3)
- **Low Risk**: Stable, tactical specialization with minimal self-harm

### Situational Power Profile

**Optimal Conditions**:

- Chokepoint battles (gates, bridges, corridors)
- Encounters with dangerous back-row enemies (casters, archers)
- High-Corruption enemy groups (guaranteed control success)
- Coordinated parties that can capitalize on positioning

**Weakness Conditions**:

- Solo play (low personal damage)
- Open terrain without positional advantages
- Large/Huge enemies immune to forced movement
- Low-Corruption enemies (reduced control success)

### Synergies

**Positive**:

- **Skjaldmær/Atgeir-wielder**: Hold lanes after you break formations
- **Strike specialists** (Berserkr, Veiðimaðr): Capitalize on [Vulnerable] from pulls
- **Environmental hazards**: Pull enemies into fire, acid, or terrain features

**Negative**:

- **Burst damage races**: Your setup takes time
- **AoE-immune encounters**: Single-target focus limits crowd control

---

## VI. Social Function (Layer 2)

The Hlekkr-master serves critical civic functions beyond combat:

- **Corridor Safety**: Managing crowd-flow at gates and markets
- **Restraint Protocols**: Non-lethal control for civil disturbances
- **Hazard Mapping**: Marking dangers for allies before exploiting them against foes
- **Formation Breaking**: Converting entrenched positions into vulnerable chaos

---

## VII. v5.0 Setting Compliance

✅ **Technology, Not Magic**: Chains, hooks, nets—physical tools, not supernatural powers

✅ **Layer 2 Voice**: "Leash doctrine," "positional control," "system lag exploitation"

✅ **Norse-Inspired**: Hlekkr (chain/fetter), practical warrior craftsmanship

✅ **Blight Integration**: Corruption exploitation is the core control advantage
