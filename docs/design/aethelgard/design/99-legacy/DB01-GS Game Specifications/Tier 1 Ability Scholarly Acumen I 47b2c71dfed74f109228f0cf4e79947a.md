### **Ability Overview**

**Specialization:** Jötun-Reader (System Pathologist)

**Tier:** 1 (Foundational Analysis)

**Type:** Passive

**Prerequisite:** Unlock the Jötun-Reader Specialization (10 PP)

**Cost:** 2 PP

### **Description**

The character's academic training gives them a significant advantage on all skill checks related to knowledge and analysis. The Jötun-Reader's mind is a **finely honed analytical instrument**, a living library of forgotten history, complex schematics, and lost languages.

### **Mechanics**

**Effect:** The character receives a **permanent +2 bonus dice** to all **WITS-based checks** made for the following actions:

1. **Investigating Lore:** Using the `investigate` command to decipher [Corrupted Data-Logs], translate runic carvings, or understand historical artifacts
2. **System Bypass:** Bonus to System Bypass skill checks when used to navigate/understand ancient terminals
3. **Recalling Information:** Any dialogue checks flagged as [WITS - Lore] checks

### **Thematic Justification**

This ability represents the **rigorous, academic discipline** that forms the core of the Jötun-Reader identity. Their natural talent for academic rigor and deductive reasoning is their primary tool for deconstructing the mysteries of a broken world.

### **Progression & Milestones**

### **Rank 1 (Foundational)**

- **Effect:** **+2d10 bonus dice** to System Bypass and Investigate (lore) checks
- **Example:** WITS 9 + Investigate Rank 3 + Scholarly Acumen = **14d10 dice pool**

### **Rank 2 (Expert)**

- **Unlocked:** 20 PP invested in Jötun-Reader tree
- **Effect:** Bonus increased to **+4d10** (from +2d10)
- **Example:** WITS 10 + Investigate Rank 4 + Scholarly Acumen = **18d10 dice pool**

### **Rank 3 (Mastery)**

- **Unlocked:** Capstone ability unlocked (35-40 PP in tree)
- **Effect:** Bonus remains **+4d10**, but any **Success** on investigate checks is **automatically upgraded to Critical Success**
- **Rationale:** At Mastery, even "adequate" performance yields exceptional insights

---

### **Integration Notes**

- **Foundation of the Analyst:** This is the absolute foundation of the Jötun-Reader—the core engine for their role as lore-master and puzzle-solver
- **Always-On Power:** Unlike active abilities, provides **constant, reliable value** in every exploration and investigation scenario
- **Scaling Investment:** Grows with PP investment, rewarding commitment to the Jötun-Reader path

### **Synergies**

- **Runic Linguistics:** Bonus applies to translating inscriptions
- **Analyze Weakness:** Lore gathered provides contextual hints about enemies
- **Navigational Bypass:** Understanding from investigate checks informs better bypass strategies
- **High WITS Build:** Creates massive base dice pools (10d10 base + 4d10 bonus = 14d10 minimum at Rank 2)
