# Svin-fylking — Feral Sus scrofa roboris Organic Waste Disposal Unit Specification

> *"The Skalds call them the Iron-Husked Boars, a living avalanche of rust and rage that sweeps across the wastes. They are not a myth or a monster from a forgotten age. The Svin-fylking are something far more terrifying: they are a symbol of the world's new, savage nature. They are not a product of the Age of Forging's genius, but a direct, brutal consequence of its failure. They are what happens when life is left to fester in a graveyard of steel."*

| **Faction Alignment** | None (Feral Bio-Asset) |
| **Hazard Type** | Biological, Ferrous, Physical/Environmental |

The Svin-fylking is not merely a beast. It is an **adaptation made armor**. A **garbage processor turned siege engine**. A pig that learned to eat steel and wear it as skin.

> [!DANGER]
> **EXTREME HAZARD CLASSIFICATION.** Default doctrine is **NON-CONTACT**. The Svin-fylking is the apex organic predator of Jötunheim's wastes—territorial, intelligent, and equipped with natural siege weaponry. A single sounder in wedge formation can shatter reinforced palisades and crush entire patrol squads. Stand-off distance minimum 50 m (standard); 80+ m if piglets or wallow sites visible.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Organic Disposal Unit

### Original Purpose

The ancestor of the Svin-fylking was a mundane but vital bio-asset created by the Vanir Collective: *Sus scrofa roboris*—a genetically optimized variant of the common wild boar.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Midgard Habitation Decks** | Organic waste disposal and reclamation |
| **Bio-Dome Parks** | Biodegradable waste processing |
| **Arcology Gardens** | Nutrient-rich fertilizer production |

These were not designed for predation. Their purpose was **absolute, systematic cleanliness of the organic waste stream**. They were the unseen sanitation corps keeping the arcology's parks pristine.

### The Living Waste Processor

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Body Plan** | Genetically optimized boar; hardy, intelligent, efficient |
| **Temperament** | Docile herd behavior; responsive to acoustic cues and feed schedules |
| **Digestive System** | Omnivorous metabolism optimized for rapid breakdown of biodegradable waste |
| **Output Capacity** | Single herd (15-30 animals) processed 500-800 kg organic waste per day |
| **Fertilizer Yield** | 200-300 kg nutrient-rich soil produced daily |
| **Size Regulation** | Standard adult size 200-300 kg; moderate growth rate to prevent infrastructure strain |

Unlike predatory bio-assets, the Flumen-Purger was designed to be tough, omnivorous, and highly efficient. The Vanir, in their pursuit of the perfect biological system, made them a little **too good at surviving**.

### The Perfect World's Janitor

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Environment** | Managed ecosystems; curated habitation decks |
| **Diet** | Biodegradable waste; converted to fertilizer |
| **Behavior** | Passive; responsive to acoustic control |
| **Maintenance Role** | Continuous waste processing without intervention |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Unseen Worker.** The *Sus scrofa roboris* was never meant to be noticed. It worked in the parks and biodomes, grinding away the organic waste of a perfect world, turning garbage into garden soil. It was the janitor nobody thought about, doing the job nobody wanted.

---

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Iron Liberation

The Glitch turned the perfect waste processor into the perfect siege engine.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Genetic Optimization for Strength** | Fully functional; amplified by survival pressure |
| **Robust Digestive System** | Operational; adapted for metal-rich diet |
| **Omnivorous Metabolism** | Enhanced; processes almost anything |
| **Intelligence** | Preserved and enhanced through pack coordination |

### What Was Corrupted

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Acoustic Control Systems** | Severed instantaneously |
| **Behavioral Conditioning** | Reverted to aggressive wild boar instincts |
| **Size Regulation** | Corrupted by Berkano/Jera contamination (200-300 kg → 800-2000+ kg) |
| **Docile Temperament** | Replaced by territorial aggression and coordinated fury |

### The Liberation

The Glitch severed acoustic control systems and behavioral conditioning protocols **instantaneously**. Herds reverted to aggressive wild boar instincts, amplified by genetic optimization for strength and endurance.

> **"A Broken Pen."** The failure of containment fields and arcology management systems set the boar populations free. They escaped their managed parks and flooded into a world that was suddenly both a scrapyard and a buffet.

**The New Diet:** Their engineered ability to consume almost anything meant they could thrive where other creatures starved. They learned to crack open discarded ration packs, chew through insulated cabling for the protein paste within, and even consume the Blight-mutated fungi that grew on the ruins.

**A World of Blades:** Their most crucial adaptation was behavioral. The landscape, particularly in Jötunheim and the fringes of Midgard, was now an endless field of sharp-edged scrap. To survive, the boars learned to use this lethal environment as a **tool**.

This was the birth of the **Iron Husk**.

## Physical Characteristics

### Morphology

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Form** | Colossal mutated swine; comparable to industrial machinery |
| **Shoulder Height** | 1.8–2.5 m (standard); 2.7+ m (lead boar) |
| **Length** | 3.5–5.0 m |
| **Weight** | 800–1,400 kg (standard adult); 2,000+ kg (Járn-göltr) |
| **Body Structure** | Barrel chest; enormously muscled shoulders for battering-ram charges |
| **Legs** | Thick as tree trunks; hooves 20-30 cm diameter |
| **Coloration** | Mottled grey-brown to rust-red depending on metal content |

**Overall Impression:** A moving mountain of rust and rage—legs like tree trunks, shoulders like siege rams, and a smile of honed steel.

### The Iron Husk

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Structure** | Thick keloidal scar tissue interwoven with embedded metal |
| **Composition** | Steel shards, adamantium fragments, oxidized metal plating |
| **Formation** | Self-applied through deliberate "slag-rolling" behavior |
| **Coverage** | 70–90% of body surface (flanks, shoulders, skull, back) |
| **Thickness** | 5–15 cm composite (equivalent to light vehicle plating) |
| **Vulnerable Points** | Eyes, joints, underbelly, snout (though still heavily scarred) |
| **Coloration** | Ranges from mottled grey-brown to rust-red depending on metal content |

> [!NOTE]
> **Learned Behavior, Not Mutation.** The Iron Husk is a **deliberate, learned behavior** that has become instinctual across generations. From infancy, piglets observe adults engaging in "slag-rolling" behavior. Young boars deliberately roll in and rub against jagged scrap metal, creating repeated abrasions. Scar tissue forms thick keloidal layers; metal shards become embedded during healing. The process repeats throughout life, building composite armor of scar tissue interwoven with steel.

### Forged Tusks

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Length** | 30–50 cm (standard); 70+ cm (lead boar) |
| **Composition** | Bone core fused with honed steel streaks |
| **Maintenance** | Deliberately re-sharpened on slag heaps and rebar |
| **Formation** | Broken tusks are re-forged through repeated abrasion |
| **Lethality** | Capable of penetrating reinforced wooden palisades; human impalement |

The boars sharpen their broken tusk stumps on slag heaps and twisted rebar until **steel fuses to bone**, creating deadly composite weapons that function as ready-made war implements.

### Field Recognition Signs

| Indicator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Visual** | Wedge formation tracks (8-20 animals); deep 25-35 cm hoof impacts |
| **Environmental** | Rust-stained wallow pits (5-10 m diameter, 1-2 m depth) |
| **Acoustic** | Metallic clatter and grinding (>100 m detection range) |
| **Forensic** | Sharpening site scrape marks; concentrated metal fragments |
| **Atmospheric** | Snorting and steam clouds (50-100 m range in cold) |
| **Seismic** | Ground trembling perceptible within 200 m during charge |

---

## Runic Corruption and Gigantism

The Svin-fylking's unnatural size and relentless aggression are not merely evolutionary—they are symptoms of **runic contamination**.

### Thurisaz (ᚦ) Corruption

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Original Function** | Surgical, directed force |
| **Corrupted Expression** | "Blind, drunken sledgehammer" |
| **Behavioral Manifestation** | Relentless, non-tactical fury |
| **Charge Characteristics** | Chaotic aggression; overwhelming physical force |

The creature's relentless charge exhibits characteristics of corrupted Thurisaz—the rune of directed force degraded into pure, mindless momentum.

### Berkano (ᛒ) and Jera (ᛃ) Contamination

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Evidence** | Uncontrolled growth beyond 200-300 kg baseline |
| **Current Adult Size** | 800-1,400 kg (standard); 2,000+ kg (lead boar) |
| **Healing Acceleration** | Unnaturally rapid scar tissue formation |
| **Armor Mechanism** | Berkano's cancerous growth co-opted for Iron Husk formation |
| **Cycle Disruption** | Jera corruption contributing to accelerated maturation |

The creature's gigantism—growing to four to seven times original design specifications—suggests contamination by corrupted life-runes. The accelerated healing that enables rapid Iron Husk formation may indicate Berkano's cancerous growth pattern turned to defensive purpose.

---

## Behavioral Patterns

### Herd Structure: The Sounder

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Typical Size** | 8–20 animals |
| **Structure** | Matriarch or dominant boar (Járn-göltr) leads; sub-adults and juveniles in formation |
| **Hierarchy** | Determined by size, tusk condition, and combat success |
| **Re-group Cadence** | After dispersal, sounder re-forms within 5-8 minutes at rally points |
| **Seasonal Variation** | Herds may fragment during mating season or resource scarcity |

### The Járn-göltr (Iron-Boar)

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Size** | Largest male in sounder (2,000+ kg) |
| **Function** | Sets flight vs. fight response for entire herd |
| **Combat Role** | First to engage threats; protected by formation |
| **Position** | Apex of wedge formation during charge |
| **Survival** | Lifespan advantage through superior armor |

The lead boar is the **keystone** of the sounder. Where it goes, the herd follows. What it attacks, the herd attacks. Its decision to charge commits every animal behind it to the same fate.

### The Fylking Charge (Signature Tactic)

The Svin-fylking's namesake tactic is a **coordinated wedge formation charge**—a living battering ram that has broken palisades, overturned vehicles, and crushed entire patrol squads.

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Warning Posture** | Head lowering; tusks oriented forward; pawing and scraping |
| **Formation Tightening** | Herd condenses into wedge shape behind lead boar |
| **Apex Positioning** | Járn-göltr takes forward point of wedge |
| **Charge Initiation** | Moderate speed accelerating to full velocity |
| **Full Charge** | 4-10 m/s; combined mass 6,400-28,000 kg; ground trembling |
| **Impact** | Capable of shattering palisades; crushing humans; overturning vehicles |
| **Resolution** | Regroup at rally point (wallow site, sharpening station) |

**Formation Mechanics:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Wedge Shape** | Lead boar at apex; progressively smaller animals on flanks |
| **Optimal Density** | 0.5–0.7 animals per meter of lane width |
| **Cascade Threshold** | >0.7 animals/m lane (stampede cascade risk) |
| **Sustained Velocity** | 4–6 m/s |
| **Sprint Velocity** | 8–10 m/s (short bursts when fully committed) |
| **Combined Mass** | 6,400–28,000 kg (8-20 animal sounder) |

**Charge Triggers:**

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Proximity** | Within 30-40 m of piglets or wallow sites |
| **Acoustic** | Sudden blasts >90 dB |
| **Visual** | Raised spear profiles; rapid lateral movement inside 20 m |
| **Tactical** | Flanking or constriction of escape routes |
| **Resource** | Perceived threat to food sources or sharpening sites |

### Territorial Behavior

| Territory Feature | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Wallow Sites** | Rust-stained mud pits (5-10 m diameter, 1-2 m depth); crucial territorial markers |
| **Sharpening Sites** | Slag heaps and rebar fields for tusk/armor maintenance; defended aggressively |
| **Range** | 20-50 km² per sounder; overlapping territories common but contested |
| **Migration** | Seasonal movement to Midgard during "Boar Moon" (autumn harvest raids) |

### Sensory Profile

| Sense | Capability |
|-------|------------|
| **Olfaction** | Dominant sense; can detect blood at 2+ km range |
| **Vision** | Adequate but not primary; small, deep-set eyes |
| **Audition** | Sensitive to specific acoustic patterns |
| **Attraction** | Blood scent; low-hum feed augers (remnant conditioning); metallic grinding sounds |
| **Aversion** | 2-short-1-long bell cadence; staggered baffles; acoustic ceiling ≤85 dB |

### Lethality Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Physical Threat Level** | Extreme |
| **CPS/Psychological Threat** | Low (no Aetheric signature or psychological manipulation) |
| **Single Sounder Capability** | Can destroy fortified settlements; crush entire patrol squads |
| **Light Projectile Effectiveness** | None (arrows, small-caliber firearms ineffective) |
| **Required Countermeasures** | Heavy ordnance or specialized penetrators |
| **Pursuit Behavior** | Does not pursue beyond territorial boundaries |

### Threat Comparison: Svin-fylking vs. Malm-ormr

| Factor | Svin-fylking | Malm-ormr |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **Behavior** | Deliberate territorial aggressor | Oblivious geological force |
| **Tactics** | Coordinated herd; wedge formation | Solitary; mindless tunneling |
| **Intent** | Actively targets perceived threats | No targeting; environmental destruction |
| **Countermeasures** | Vulnerable to acoustic/baffle control | Unstoppable |
| **Predictability** | Responds to triggers; can be deterred | Cannot be deterred or controlled |

### Secondary Hazards

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Wallow Pit Formation** | Destabilizes terrain; 5-10 m craters pose vehicle/structural hazard |
| **Sharpening Site Debris** | Scattered sharp metal fragments create penetration hazards |
| **Migration Damage** | Collapsed structures, breached storage during Boar Moon |
| **Ferrous Contamination** | Rust particles from rooting may accelerate Iron-Curse spread |
| **Spore Carriage** | Wallowing in spore-rich mud creates contamination vector |
| **Blight Exposure** | Tusks/armor may carry residual Blight; penetration wounds risk infection |

| Condition | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Standard** | Buffer ≥50 m |
| **Piglets or Wallow Sites Visible** | Buffer ≥80 m |
| **Stampede Formation** | Buffer ≥100 m |
| **Acoustic Ceiling** | Enforce ≤85 dB |
| **Density Threshold** | Black-flag if ≥0.7 animals/m lane |
| **Velocity Abort** | Immediate withdrawal if >6 m/s |

### Detection and Early Warning

**Black-Flag Indicators:**

| Indicator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Charge Posture** | Head lowering; tusks forward; pawing; wedge tightening |
| **Ground Trembling** | Perceptible within 200 m during charge |
| **Metallic Clatter** | Audible at >100 m from hoof strikes |
| **Steam Clouds** | Snorting visible at 50-100 m (cold/exertion) |

| **Velocity Escalation** | Herd movement exceeding 6 m/s |

### Field Card: Svin-fylking Protocols

| Phase | Protocol |
|-------|----------|
| **BEFORE** | Set buffer ≥50 m (≥80 m if piglets/wallow visible); identify lead boar (Járn-göltr); count sounder size; enforce acoustic ceiling ≤85 dB; prepare 2-short-1-long bell cadence; position staggered baffles at 50 m intervals; identify 2-3 egress paths perpendicular to expected charge vector |
| **DURING (Observation)** | Clock herd movement; abort if velocity >6 m/s; visual estimate of formation density; black-flag if ≥0.7 animals/m lane; maintain acoustic ceiling; deploy bell cadence if charge posture develops; no raised spear profiles or rapid lateral movement inside 20 m; no strobe or white flood lights within 100 m; no approach to wallow sites or piglet groups |
| **DURING (Interdiction)** | Authorization: Incident Commander only; shock prod arcs targeting lead boar to disrupt wedge apex; abort if velocity >6 m/s or density ≥0.7/m lane; no projectile fire; no pursuit into Knuckle-Bone Fields or debris zones |
| **AFTER** | Verify herd velocity <2 m/s for 60 seconds before safe condition; confirm sounder dispersed ≥200 m before operations; mandatory biohazard scan <50 spores/L; log sounder count, direction, corridor reopening time; tusks/hide/shards only after biohazard clearance; file encounter report |

### BLACK-FLAG Conditions

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Charge posture observed** | Immediate withdrawal; deploy bell cadence |
| **Velocity exceeds 6 m/s** | Abort all operations; egress perpendicular to charge vector |
| **Density ≥0.7 animals/m lane** | Stampede cascade risk; no interdiction authorized |
| **Piglets visible** | Increase buffer to ≥80 m; extreme territorial response likely |
| **Acoustic blast >90 dB** | Potential charge trigger; immediate silence discipline |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Projectile fire** | Light firearms ineffective; heavy ordnance collateral unacceptable |
| **Pursuit into Knuckle-Bone Fields** | Terrain advantage to sounder; ricochet/debris hazards |
| **Approach to wallow sites** | Core territorial trigger; near-certain charge response |
| **Lethal force (without authorization)** | Guild arbitration required; mass casualty scenario only |
| **Strobe lights within 100 m** | Startle response may trigger charge |
| **Flanking movements** | Constriction of escape routes triggers defensive charge |

## Factional Perspectives

### Iron-Bane Crusade: The Rust-Beast Paradox

| Assessment | Doctrine |
|------------|----------|
| **Classification** | "Flesh-Iron Abomination" (below Undying, above mundane beasts) |
| **Moral Status** | Victims of Iron-Curse, not inherently evil |
| **Theological Position** | Innocent animals corrupted by contamination from buried pre-Glitch sites |
| **Response** | "Hunt-as-Mercy"—killing as compassion, freeing corrupted creatures |
| **Ritual Requirement** | Fasting and purification before hunt; swift death; blessing over corpse |
| **Salvage Prohibition** | Iron Husk material must be destroyed (forge-fire or acid dissolution) |
| **Exception** | Bone and tusk may be salvaged after consecration rites |

**The Litany of the Three Irons:**
> *"Three irons we quench: the Heart that hums, the Husk that walks, the Word that stains."*

**The Parable of the Iron Boar:** A cautionary tale tells of a farmer who fed iron scraps to pigs rather than disposing of them properly. The pigs transformed into monsters and slew their owner. Moral: the Iron-Curse spreads through negligence and greed.

**Factional Tensions:** Significant friction with Rust-Clans over Iron Husk salvage economics. Iron-Bane presence in a region depresses salvage prices due to confiscation risk.

### Jötun-Readers (Scriptorium): The Survivor's Testament

| Assessment | Value |
|------------|-------|
| **Scientific Interest** | Prime example of post-Glitch behavioral adaptation |
| **Research Priority** | Fylking charge mechanics; Iron Husk formation; Blight contamination |
| **Ecological Role** | Apex organic predator; ferrous scavenger; territorial aggressor |
| **Philosophical Position** | "Perfect symbol of life's ferocious, uncompromising will to survive" |

**Lead Ecologist's Assessment:** *"The Vanir made a pig to eat garbage. The Ginnungagap Glitch turned the world into a garbage heap of shattered steel. The pig, in its simple wisdom, did not despair. It learned to eat the garbage. Then it learned to wear it. It is the perfect creature for this age: stubborn, ugly, and harder than the hell it calls home."*

**Research Focus:** The Svin-fylking offers crucial data on the failure of Vanir bio-engineering—a case study in how survival pressure can transform a docile waste processor into an apex predator within generations.

### God-Sleepers: Avatar of Freyr's Wrath

| Classification | Interpretation |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Theological Status** | "Children of the Slumbering Forge-Gods" |
| **Evidence Cited** | Iron Husk formation as "divine gift"; coordinated intelligence as "god-touch" |
| **Sacred Geography** | Warbands often den near Jötun-Forged sites; "keep vigil over the Sleeping Gods" |
| **Moral Status** | Sacred beings; not to be hunted except in self-defense |
| **Ritual Significance** | Particularly large Járn-göltr may be seen as untouchable sacred beasts |
| **Pilgrimage Impact** | Encounters with warbands seen as "tests of devotion" |

**Theological Conflict:** Iron-Banes consider God-Sleeper reverence for Iron Husk material heresy. The debate continues unresolved.

### Midgard Combine: The Livestock Nemesis

| Assessment | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Risk Classification** | Plague upon the agricultural economy |
| **Seasonal Peak** | "Boar Moon" (autumn harvest raids) |
| **Infrastructure Costs** | Palisade construction (500-1,000 PS per perimeter); acoustic systems (100-200 PS) |
| **Economic Impact** | Documented losses 2,000-5,000 PS per Boar Moon cycle |
| **Labor Cost** | 10-20% settlement workforce during Boar Moon defensive operations |
| **Cultural Status** | "Boar-Dread" documented as analogue to "Wurm-Fear" |

**Folk Assessment (Alrek the Quill-Handed):**
> *"There is nothing clever about a Svin-fylking. It is a battering ram that has learned to hate. It has two moods: eating and charging. If you are not a root or a fungus, it will assume you are in the way of its eating, and it will charge."*

### Dökkálfar Scavenger Clans: Uneconomical Risk

| Assessment | Strategy |
|------------|----------|
| **Risk Classification** | High risk, marginal reward |
| **Operational Doctrine** | Territory avoidance; opportunistic scavenging only |
| **Economic Calculus** | Iron Husk salvage value rarely justifies engagement risk |
| **Route Mapping** | Acoustic migration route mapping to avoid sounder territories |
| **Philosophy** | "Nature's reclamation"—let the land process the beasts |

### Dvergr Forge-Masters: The Contaminated Sample

| Assessment | Position |
|------------|----------|
| **Material Classification** | Contaminated; economically marginal |
| **Research Interest** | Limited (Iron Husk formation mechanism; contamination vectors) |
| **Trade Position** | Will accept consecrated bone/tusk from Iron-Bane sources |
| **Shared Ground with Iron-Banes** | Both consider Iron Husk material problematic (different reasons) |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)

*"The Járn-göltr leads the charge, the Moving Mountain, the Rust-Beast whose hide is the bones of the old world made armor. They come in the Boar Moon, when the harvest ripens and the walls of men seem thin as parchment. Their tusks are the daggers of a forgotten age. Their fury is the fury of the earth itself, rising against those who would scratch a living from its scarred surface. Do not stand before the Svin-fylking. They are the avalanche that has learned to hate."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)

*"Feral Vanir bio-asset exhibiting complete behavioral adaptation to post-Glitch conditions. The Sus scrofa roboris waste processing unit's genetic optimization for strength and omnivorous metabolism—combined with severed behavioral conditioning—enabled rapid exploitation of metallic wasteland environments. The defining adaptation is behavioral-anatomical: deliberate integration of scrap metal into keloidal scar tissue ('Iron Husk') and composite bone-steel tusk formation through ritualized sharpening behavior. Runic contamination (Thurisaz, Berkano, Jera) implicated in gigantism and charge fury. Apex organic predator status achieved through coordinated wedge formation tactics ('Fylking Charge'). Non-contact doctrine mandatory."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)

*"Sus scrofa roboris Vanir-Optimized Variant, Organic Waste Disposal Unit, Class OWD-3000 Series (feral). Original function: biodegradable waste processing for Midgard habitation decks. Post-Glitch adaptation: behavioral exaptation enabling metal shard integration into keloidal scar tissue via repetitive abrasion-healing cycles. Tusk modification creates composite bone-steel dentition through deliberate sharpening on ferrous slag. Charge coordination represents emergent pack behavior—wedge formation density 0.5-0.7 animals/m lane, velocity 4-10 m/s, combined mass 6,400-28,000 kg. Size increase from 200-300 kg baseline to 800-2,000+ kg indicates life-rune (Berkano/Jera) contamination. Territorial behavior centers on wallow sites and sharpening stations. Acoustic deterrence effective below 85 dB threshold."*

## Summary

The Svin-fylking is survival made weapon.

It was designed to be the perfect waste processor—docile, efficient, omnivorous, grinding away the organic refuse of a perfect world. Its robust metabolism was engineered to break down anything. Its hardy constitution was optimized for endless, thankless labor. Its acoustic conditioning made it controllable, predictable, invisible.

And it worked. All of it worked. **Perfectly.**

That is the horror.

The Glitch did not corrupt the Svin-fylking's core systems. It did not break its digestive capacity or weaken its constitution. The creature's processing capabilities emerged from the catastrophe intact—but the world it was built to clean had become a graveyard of metal.

The only things that were lost were the controls.

The acoustic cues. The behavioral conditioning. The containment fields.

Now the boar was free. And the world was full of garbage.

So the pig did what it was designed to do. It processed what the world provided. It consumed the ruins. It broke its teeth on adamantium plating. It starved in the wasteland of a world it was built to maintain.

But some survived.

Some learned.

They learned that the metal that broke their tusks could **become** their tusks. They learned that the scrap that scarred their hides could **become** their armor. They learned that the shattered world was not a prison but a **forge**.

Generation after generation, the behavior passed down. The piglets watched the adults roll in slag. The juveniles learned to sharpen broken tusks on rebar. The sounder learned to charge in formation—a wedge of rust and rage that could break any wall.

And now they wait in the Knuckle-Bone Fields, where the giants fell and the metal lies thick as snow.

Patient as hunger.

Furious as the age that made them.

Their hides are the bones of the old world.

Their tusks are the daggers of a forgotten age.

And their charge is the answer to a simple, brutal question:

**What happens when you make a pig too good at surviving?**

You make a god of iron and hate.

And it will never, ever stop.
