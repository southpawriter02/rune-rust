## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Skirmisher |
| **Role** | Stealth Assassin / Alpha Strike |
| **Path Type** | Heretical |
| **Primary Attribute** | FINESSE |
| **Secondary Attribute** | WILL |
| **Resource System** | Stamina + Focus |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | High |

The **Myrk-gengr** is the perceptual predator, the ghost in the machine.

They do not hide in shadows. They do not crouch behind debris or time their movements to the footfalls of patrols. The Myrk-gengr does something far more profound and far more dangerous: they **erase themselves from perception** by synchronizing their presence with the world's eternal psychic static.

Where other minds recoil from the chaotic, maddening hum of the Runic Blight, the Myrk-gengr finds *comfort*. The background noise that drives others to madness becomes camouflage. The screaming static that frays sanity becomes cover. They wrap themselves in the world's corruption and vanish—not hidden in shadow, but **erased from existence**.

Their attacks from stealth deal physical damage and psychological terror. Their capstone lets them become a living glitch—a reality-warping assassination at extreme Corruption cost.

They are the blade appearing from nowhere.

## Core Philosophy: The Perceptual Predator

### The Silence After Thunder

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Power is Quiet** | True power is not a loud declaration—it is a whisper that ends lives |
| **The Static is Camouflage** | The Blight's noise is not a threat but a tool |
| **Strike from Void** | Attacks come from nowhere, dealing physical and psychological damage |
| **Existence is Optional** | At the highest levels, reality itself becomes negotiable |

The Myrk-gengr philosophy rejects the loud, declarative power of the Iron-Banes and the Berserkr. They believe true power is not a **loud thing**—it is a whisper that ends lives before the victim knows they are threatened.

> *"They believe that power is a loud thing—a war-cry, a blazing fire, the crash of a charging Jötun-Forged. We know the truth. Power is a silent thing. Power is a whisper in the dark. Power is being invisible in a world that is constantly screaming."*

### The Heretical Bargain

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Source** | Synchronization with the Runic Blight's psychic static |
| **Method** | Mental discipline to find comfort in corruption |
| **Cost** | Progressive Corruption accumulation; high Trauma risk |
| **Ultimate Expression** | Becoming a living glitch—temporarily existing outside reality |

This is not a coherent path. The Myrk-gengr's power comes from **willingly immersing themselves in the Blight's corruption**. They do not fight the static—they become part of it. This grants them incredible power at terrible cost.

Every time they vanish into the void, they take a piece of the void with them. Every time they strike from nowhere, they blur the line between themselves and the screaming chaos they hide within. The most powerful Myrk-gengr abilities inflict significant self-Corruption—the price of becoming a ghost.

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Invisible assassin; the blade from nowhere |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Setup-payoff loop; devastating alpha strikes from stealth |
| **Success Metric** | Priority targets eliminated before they can act |
| **Decision Space** | When to strike, when to wait, managing Corruption spiral |

Playing a Myrk-gengr is about **patience and devastation**.

You spend actions entering stealth, positioning for the perfect strike, waiting for the moment when maximum damage can be inflicted on the highest-priority target. Then you strike—and if everything goes right, the enemy dies before they know you existed.

Your damage output from stealth is among the highest in the game. Your survivability outside of stealth is among the lowest. This creates extreme risk/reward gameplay: the perfect assassination is devastating, but a failed stealth check or a well-timed AoE leaves you exposed and vulnerable.

> *"Their success relies on the rest of the party keeping the main enemy force occupied and distracted, giving the Myrk-gengr the time and space needed to re-enter stealth after an attack."*

## Abilities: The Art of the Unseen

### Tier 1 — Foundational Void

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **One with the Static I** | Passive | — | +1d10 to Stealth checks; +2d10 additional in [Psychic Resonance] zones |
| **Enter the Void** | Active | 40 Stamina | Make Stealth check (DC 16) to enter [Hidden] state |
| **Shadow Strike** | Active | 35 Stamina | From [Hidden]: Guaranteed critical hit (double damage); immediately breaks stealth |

**One with the Static I** represents the foundational perceptual shift that defines the Myrk-gengr. While a normal mind recoils from the chaotic, maddening hum of the Runic Blight, the Myrk-gengr has learned to find comfort in it—even to use it as camouflage.

The bonus in [Psychic Resonance] zones is massive (+2d10 additional). In areas saturated with Blight corruption—places that inflict Psychic Stress on other characters—the Myrk-gengr becomes nearly impossible to detect. The world's chaos is their cover.

**Enter the Void** is not a simple act of hiding in the dark. It is a profound act of mental discipline—synchronizing your presence with the world's psychic static until you **vanish from perception**. You are not hidden in shadow; you are erased from the target's ability to perceive you.

> *"You synchronize your presence with the world's psychic static and vanish from sight—not hidden in shadow, but erased from perception."*

**Shadow Strike** is the payoff. From [Hidden], your attack is a **guaranteed critical hit**—double damage, automatically landing. This is not just a sneak attack; it is a violation of causality. The Myrk-gengr strikes from a blind spot in reality, and the blade finds its mark before the target's corrupted processors can register the threat.

The attack immediately breaks stealth. One shot, one kill—or you're exposed.

### Tier 2 — Advanced Predation

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Throat-Cutter** | Active | 45 Stamina | Melee attack + 2d8 damage; from flank/Hidden: apply [Silenced] 1 turn |
| **Sensory Scramble** | Active | 35 Stamina | Create zone that blinds/deafens enemies; enables stealth re-entry |
| **Ghostly Form** | Passive | — | 50% chance to remain [Hidden] after attacking |
| **Terror from the Void** | Passive | — | First strike from [Hidden] inflicts 12 Psychic Stress + [Feared] |

**Throat-Cutter** is the silent kill—striking from behind with lethal precision, severing vocal cords before the scream can escape. The [Silenced] effect prevents the target from calling for help or using abilities that require vocalization.

**Sensory Scramble** is not a simple smoke bomb. It is a denial-of-service attack on the senses:

> *"The Myrk-gengr throws a specially crafted dart that shatters, releasing a fine powder of Blighted reagents that briefly overloads the senses."*

The zone created allows the Myrk-gengr to re-enter stealth mid-combat—essential for the hit-and-fade playstyle that defines the specialization.

**Ghostly Form** is the game-changer. Normally, attacking from [Hidden] immediately breaks stealth. With Ghostly Form, there's a 50% chance you remain hidden after the attack—allowing for potential chain assassinations. At Rank 3, this increases to 80% and grants a free Move action on success.

**Terror from the Void** weaponizes the sheer psychological horror of the Myrk-gengr's attack. The target doesn't just take physical damage—they experience the **paradoxical terror** of being attacked by something their mind cannot process. 12 Psychic Stress and [Feared] status on every first strike from stealth.

### Tier 3 — Mastery of Erasure

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Mind of Stillness** | Passive | — | Remove Psychic Stress passively while [Hidden]; immunity to [Fear] |
| **One with the Static III** | Passive | — | +3d10 Stealth base; enemies -2d10 to detect you in Resonance zones |

**Mind of Stillness** is the Myrk-gengr's unique stress management tool. While other characters need to use actions or consumables to remove Psychic Stress, the Myrk-gengr can do so passively simply by remaining hidden. The void is peaceful. The static is soothing. In erasure, they find calm.

**One with the Static III** represents complete mastery of perceptual denial. The Myrk-gengr's stealth bonus becomes overwhelming, and in [Psychic Resonance] zones, enemies actively suffer penalties to detect them—the corruption that maddens others actively conceals the Shadow-Walker.

### Capstone — Living Glitch

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Activation** | Standard Action; requires [Hidden] state |
| **Damage** | 12d10 (Rank 3); guaranteed hit (no attack roll) |
| **Terror** | 35 Psychic Stress to target |
| **Cost** | 12 Corruption (Rank 3) |
| **Special** | If kill, do not break stealth (Rank 3) |

The capstone **Living Glitch** is the ultimate expression of the Myrk-gengr philosophy—and the ultimate heretical bargain.

> *"For a single, horrifying moment, you do not hide in a glitch—you become one. You de-compile your own physical presence, stepping outside the world's logical grid to deliver a blow that is a fundamental violation of causality."*

This is not stealth. This is not an attack from hiding. This is **ceasing to exist within reality** for a single moment, striking from a place that cannot be defended against, and then re-compiling yourself back into the world.

The attack is a **guaranteed hit**—no attack roll, no evasion, no defense. The target takes massive physical damage and catastrophic Psychic Stress (35 points). The cost is equally catastrophic: 12 Corruption at Rank 3.

At Rank 3, if the attack kills the target, you do not break stealth. You can chain Living Glitch into another assassination—if you're willing to pay the Corruption cost again.

This is the ultimate assassin's tool: delete a priority target with absolute certainty, at the cost of your own humanity.

## Systemic Integration

### The [Hidden] State

| Mechanic | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Entry** | Requires Standard Action + successful Stealth check |
| **Benefit** | Cannot be targeted by single-target abilities; enables devastating attacks |
| **Breaking** | Broken by attacking (unless Ghostly Form procs), taking damage, environmental effects |
| **Re-entry** | Requires another Standard Action (significant tempo loss) |

The [Hidden] state is the Myrk-gengr's core mechanic. While hidden, you cannot be targeted by single-target abilities—you are effectively untargetable until you choose to reveal yourself.

This power is balanced by clear counters:

| Counter | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **AoE Abilities** | Hit all characters regardless of [Hidden] state |
| **DoT Effects** | [Bleeding], [Poisoned] break stealth when damage ticks |
| **Tremorsense** | Gorge-Maw Ascetics can always "see" hidden characters |
| **Action Cost** | Re-entering stealth costs a full Standard Action |

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Heretical (negative Trauma interactions possible) |
| **Self-Inflicted Risk** | High (Living Glitch costs 12 Corruption) |
| **Mitigation** | Mind of Stillness provides passive Stress reduction while hidden |
| **Strategic Implication** | High-risk/high-reward; Corruption spiral is real danger |

The Myrk-gengr is a **Heretical** specialization. Their power comes from willingly synchronizing with the Blight's corruption—and that corruption accumulates.

The Living Glitch capstone can be used multiple times per combat, but each use costs 12 Corruption. A Myrk-gengr who chains assassinations will rapidly approach dangerous Corruption thresholds. The question becomes: how many targets are worth your soul?

Mind of Stillness provides some mitigation—passive Stress reduction while hidden—but the Corruption from heretical abilities cannot be so easily managed.

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Skjaldmær / Tank** | Keeps enemies occupied while Myrk-gengr positions |
| **Skald / Controller** | Debuffs enable easier kills; crowd control creates openings |
| **Bone-Setter** | Essential for managing Corruption and Stress aftermath |
| **Ruin-Stalker** | Create Diversion enables party-wide stealth |

The Myrk-gengr is a "lone wolf" operator, functioning independently from the party's main battle line. They seek flanking positions, wait for opportunities, and strike when maximum damage can be dealt.

Their success depends on the party keeping enemies distracted—particularly tanks who can hold aggro while the Myrk-gengr positions for the kill.

### Hard Counters

| Enemy Type | Why It Counters |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Gorge-Maw Ascetic** | Tremorsense ignores [Hidden] completely |
| **AoE Specialists** | Area damage hits regardless of stealth |
| **DoT Appliers** | Damage ticks break stealth |
| **High-Perception Enemies** | May detect despite bonuses |

The Gorge-Maw Ascetic with Tremorsense is the **ultimate predator of predators**—completely immune to the Myrk-gengr's core mechanic.

## Lore Integration

### Origins of the Art

| Aspect | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Historical Roots** | Pre-Glitch special operations; covert infiltration specialists |
| **Post-Glitch Evolution** | Discovery that Blight static could be used as camouflage |
| **Training Tradition** | Secretive; passed through informal networks and necessity |
| **Factional Affiliation** | Independent/Unaligned (no faction claims them openly) |

The Myrk-gengr tradition evolved from necessity. In the chaos of the post-Glitch world, those who could move unseen survived. Those who could not were consumed by the predators—human and otherwise—that stalked the ruins.

The discovery that the Blight's psychic static could be used as camouflage was accidental—survivors noticed that in high-Resonance zones, perception became unreliable. The most adaptable learned to exploit this unreliability, synchronizing their presence with the noise until they became invisible.

This is not a formal school. There are no academies, no certifications, no guild halls. The Myrk-gengr tradition passes through informal networks—whispered techniques shared between survivors, skills learned through desperate necessity in the ruins.

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Jötun-Readers** | Scientifically fascinating; dangerous precedent for Blight exploitation |
| **Iron-Banes** | Heretical corruption of the self; theologically condemned |
| **God-Sleepers** | Useful tools; their willingness to touch corruption is pragmatically valuable |
| **Rust-Clans** | Respected specialists; the art of the bodge applied to perception |
| **Rangers Guild** | Valuable scouts for high-hazard reconnaissance |

The Iron-Banes condemn the Myrk-gengr as heretics who willingly corrupt themselves—which is technically accurate. The Jötun-Readers find them scientifically fascinating, a proof-of-concept that the Blight can be exploited rather than simply endured.

The Rust-Clans respect anyone who can turn the broken world's hazards into tools. The Myrk-gengr philosophy aligns with the Gutter-Galdr ethos: pragmatic exploitation of corruption when the payoff exceeds the risk.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the old tales, the greatest hunters were not the strongest or the fastest—they were the ones you never saw coming. The Myrk-gengr, the Shadow-Walkers, are the heirs to that tradition. But in the Age of Echoes, hiding in shadow is not enough. The world itself screams endlessly, a cacophony of corrupted code and paradoxical noise. The Myrk-gengr learned to hide in that scream. Where others hear only madness, they hear camouflage. Where others feel only fear, they find comfort. They synchronize their presence with the world's eternal static until they cease to exist—not hidden, but erased. And from that erasure, they strike. The blade appears from nowhere. The target falls. And the Shadow-Walker vanishes back into the screaming void, as if they were never there at all."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Myrk-gengr (Shadow-Walker) represents the Heretical Skirmisher specialization optimized for stealth assassination and alpha strike damage. Mechanical role: single-target burst damage dealer with stealth-dependent power curve. Key differentiator: exploitation of [Psychic Resonance] zones for enhanced concealment (+2d10 Stealth in Blight-saturated environments). Core mechanic: [Hidden] state enabling guaranteed critical hits via Shadow Strike. Trauma Economy interaction: High self-Corruption risk from capstone ability (Living Glitch: 12 Corruption per use). Optimal deployment: Priority target elimination, boss assassination, flanking operations. Hard countered by: AoE abilities, Tremorsense (Gorge-Maw Ascetic), DoT effects that break stealth. Party role: Independent operator requiring tank support to create engagement windows."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Myrk-gengr (Shadow-Walker). ARCHETYPE: Skirmisher. PATH TYPE: Heretical. ROLE: Stealth Assassin / Alpha Strike. PRIMARY STAT: FINESSE. SECONDARY STAT: WILL. RESOURCE: Stamina + Focus. CORE MECHANICS: [Hidden] state (untargetable), Shadow Strike (guaranteed crit from stealth), Psychic Resonance exploitation (+2d10 Stealth). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Void): One with the Static I, Enter the Void, Shadow Strike. T2 (Advanced Predation): Throat-Cutter, Sensory Scramble, Ghostly Form, Terror from the Void. T3 (Mastery of Erasure): Mind of Stillness, One with the Static III. CAPSTONE: Living Glitch (guaranteed hit, 12d10 damage, 35 Psychic Stress, 12 Corruption cost, stealth retention on kill at Rank 3). COUNTERS: AoE, Tremorsense, DoT breaking stealth. SYNERGIES: Tanks (distraction), Controllers (openings), Healers (Corruption management)."*

## Summary

The Myrk-gengr is the **blade from nowhere**.

In a world where the eternal scream of the Runic Blight drives minds to madness, the Myrk-gengr has learned to hide within that scream. They do not crouch in shadows or time their movements to patrols—they **erase themselves from perception** by synchronizing with the world's psychic static until they cease to exist.

This is not a coherent path. The power to vanish comes from willingly immersing yourself in corruption, and that corruption accumulates. Every use of the capstone Living Glitch costs 12 Corruption—the price of temporarily stepping outside reality to deliver an unavoidable killing blow.

The Myrk-gengr's gameplay is extreme risk/reward:
- **From stealth**: Among the highest single-target damage in the game
- **Outside stealth**: Among the most vulnerable characters in the game

Success requires patience, positioning, and the support of a party that can keep enemies distracted while you set up the perfect kill.

The capstone Living Glitch represents the ultimate expression of the Myrk-gengr philosophy:

> *"For a single, horrifying moment, you do not hide in a glitch—you become one."*

You de-compile your own physical presence, step outside the world's logical grid, and deliver a blow that is a fundamental violation of causality. The target cannot defend, cannot evade, cannot survive if you have done your job correctly.

The cost is your humanity. The Myrk-gengr who chains assassinations using Living Glitch will rapidly accumulate Corruption—trading their soul for the power to delete enemies from existence.

This is the heretical bargain.

This is the art of the unseen.

*They are the silence that comes after the thunder.*
