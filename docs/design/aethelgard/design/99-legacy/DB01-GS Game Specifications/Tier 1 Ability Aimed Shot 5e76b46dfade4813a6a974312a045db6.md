## Core Identity

**Aimed Shot** is the calculated execution—not a quick, reflexive shot but a moment of absolute stillness, controlled breath, and perfect release. In a world of chaotic glitches, this is an act of imposing a single, coherent, and lethal truth upon a distant foe.

## Mechanics

### Cost

20 Stamina | **Standard Action** | **Ranged Attack**

### Effect

- FINESSE-based ranged attack
- Single target, requires ranged weapon

### Rank Progression

| Rank | PP Cost | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Tactical Applications

**Core Combat Loop:**

```
Turn 1: Mark for Death → [Marked] applied
Turn 2: Aimed Shot → +25% damage vs marked target
Turn 3: Aimed Shot → +25% damage vs marked target
...repeat until target eliminated
```

**Synergies:**

- **Mark for Death:** +25% damage to marked targets
- **Exploit Corruption:** Increased crit chance vs corrupted targets
- **Heartseeker Shot:** Ultimate version of this attack
- **Stalker of the Unseen:** Adds [Staggered] proc to this attack

---

## Tactical Considerations

**Strengths:**

- Reliable, efficient single-target damage
- FINESSE scaling for both accuracy and damage
- No Psychic Stress or Corruption (coherent ability)
- Safe back-row positioning

**Limitations:**

- Single-target only (ineffective vs swarms)
- Requires maintaining ranged position
- Stamina management critical for sustained damage
