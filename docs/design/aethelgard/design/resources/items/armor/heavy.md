# Heavy Armor

## Overview

| Property | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Philosophy** | Maximum protection, mobility sacrifice |
| **Armor Types** | Plate armor, full plate, half plate, fortress armor |
| **Full Set Soak** | **18 Soak** (Head: 3, Chest: 6, Hands: 3, Legs: 3, Feet: 3) |
| **Penalties** | **-2d10** to Agility-based checks; **+5 Stamina** cost for movement actions; **Disadvantage** on Stealth |
| **Proficiency** | Warrior only |
| **Best For** | Tank Warriors (Skjaldmær); frontline defenders; high-STURDINESS builds with large Stamina pools |
| **Common Names** | Full-Shell, The Walking Fortress, Iron Mountain, Ancestor's Burden |

> **Diagnostic Notes:** Heavy armor represents the maximum passive protection achievable in post-Glitch Aethelgard—shaped metal plates covering virtually every vulnerable surface, transforming the wearer into a mobile fortification. The mobility penalties are severe; wearers sacrifice speed and flexibility for the ability to absorb punishment that would kill unarmored combatants outright. Lex-Guardian elite units (the Skjaldmær) universally wear full plate; their role as immovable defensive anchors justifies the mobility sacrifice.

## A. Half Plate

| Property | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Examples** | Half plate, breast-and-back, cuirass with limb protection |
| **Soak per Piece** | Head: 3, Chest: 6, Hands: 3, Legs: 3, Feet: 3 |
| **Full Set Soak** | 18 Soak |
| **Penalties** | -2d10 Agility; +5 Stamina for movement; Stealth disadvantage |
| **Special Properties** | **[Partial Coverage]** — Slightly reduced penalties (-1d10 Agility instead of -2d10 if foregoing limb plates) |
| **Proficiency Required** | Heavy Armor Proficiency |
| **Common Names** | Battle-Shell, The Torso-Cage, Breast-Iron, Heart-Shield |

> **Diagnostic Notes:** Half plate represents a compromise between full plate protection and practical mobility—full plate coverage on the torso (the most critical area) with lighter protection on limbs. The option to forgo limb plates reduces penalties while maintaining core protection. Caravan guards favor half plate; the protection enables defense against bandit attacks while the reduced weight permits extended travel.

### Example Armor

| Tier | Name (Quality) | Soak (Full Set) | Value (PS) | Special |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | **Scrap Cuirass** (Jury-Rigged) | 15 Soak | 80 PS | Torso only; gaps at joints |
| 1 | **Salvaged Breast-and-Back** (Scavenged) | 18 Soak | 250 PS | [Partial Coverage] option |
| 2 | **Clan Half Plate** (Clan-Forged) | 19 Soak | 650 PS | [Partial Coverage]; +1 Defense |
| 3 | **Dvergr Field Plate** (Dvergr-Forged) | 21 Soak | 1,400 PS | [Partial Coverage]; +2 Defense; articulated joints |
| 5 | **Warden's Half Plate** (Myth-Forged) | 21 Soak | 20,000 PS | [Partial Coverage]; +3 Defense; +20 max HP; immune to critical hits |

## B. Full Plate Armor

| Property | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Examples** | Full plate, gothic plate, maximilian armor, tournament armor |
| **Soak per Piece** | Head: 3, Chest: 6, Hands: 3, Legs: 3, Feet: 3 |
| **Full Set Soak** | 18 Soak |
| **Penalties** | -2d10 Agility; +5 Stamina for movement; Stealth disadvantage |
| **Special Properties** | **[Full Coverage]** — No gaps; immune to [Precision Strike] bonus damage |
| **Proficiency Required** | Heavy Armor Proficiency |
| **Common Names** | Full-Shell, The Iron Tomb, Walking Fortress, Ancestor's Burden |

> **Diagnostic Notes:** Full plate armor represents the pinnacle of post-Glitch metallurgical achievement—articulated steel plates covering virtually every surface of the body, with sophisticated jointing that permits combat movement despite the encasement. The [Full Coverage] property eliminates the anatomical vulnerabilities that precision weapons exploit; there are no gaps for a stiletto to find. Dvergr master smiths spend months crafting a single suit of quality full plate; the work is considered the highest expression of the Pure Principles.

### Example Armor

| Tier | Name (Quality) | Soak (Full Set) | Value (PS) | Special |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | **Cobbled Plate** (Jury-Rigged) | 15 Soak | 120 PS | Mismatched pieces; -1 Defense; movement limited |
| 1 | **Salvaged Full Plate** (Scavenged) | 18 Soak | 400 PS | [Full Coverage] |
| 2 | **Clan-Forged Full Plate** (Clan-Forged) | 19 Soak | 900 PS | [Full Coverage]; +1 Defense |
| 3 | **Dvergr Articulated Plate** (Dvergr-Forged) | 21 Soak | 1,800 PS | [Full Coverage]; +2 Defense; reduced penalties (-1d10 Agility) |
| 5 | **Tyr's Mantle** (Myth-Forged) | 21 Soak | 28,000 PS | [Full Coverage]; +4 Defense; +4 MIGHT; immune to [Fear], [Stunned]; reflects 2d10 damage to attackers |

## C. Fortress Armor (Siege Armor)

| Property | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Examples** | Siege armor, tower armor, Jötun-scale plate, walking fortress |
| **Soak per Piece** | Head: 3, Chest: 6, Hands: 3, Legs: 3, Feet: 3 |
| **Full Set Soak** | 18 Soak (base); up to 24 Soak (Myth-Forged) |
| **Penalties** | **-3d10 Agility**; **+8 Stamina** for movement; Stealth impossible; -2 Initiative |
| **Special Properties** | **[Immovable]** — Cannot be knocked back or moved against will; **[Siege-Class]** — Provides cover to adjacent allies |
| **Proficiency Required** | Heavy Armor Proficiency + Fortress Armor Training (rare) |
| **Common Names** | Walking Wall, The Mountain's Shell, Jötun-Hide, Immovable Object |

> **Diagnostic Notes:** Fortress armor transcends personal protection into mobile fortification—massively reinforced plates designed for siege conditions rather than individual combat. The weight approaches what an unaugmented human can bear; wearers move slowly but serve as anchor points for defensive formations. Scriptorium Vault-Wardens wear fortress armor during containment breaches; the armor enables them to hold chokepoints against overwhelming force while containment protocols complete.

### Example Armor

| Tier | Name (Quality) | Soak (Full Set) | Value (PS) | Special |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | **Improvised Tower Armor** (Jury-Rigged) | 16 Soak | 200 PS | Immobile without assistance |
| 1 | **Salvaged Siege Plate** (Scavenged) | 18 Soak | 600 PS | [Immovable] |
| 2 | **Clan Fortress Armor** (Clan-Forged) | 20 Soak | 1,400 PS | [Immovable]; [Siege-Class] |
| 3 | **Dvergr Tower Plate** (Dvergr-Forged) | 23 Soak | 3,200 PS | [Immovable]; [Siege-Class]; +3 Defense |
| 5 | **Skjaldborg Eternal** (Myth-Forged) | 24 Soak | 45,000 PS | [Immovable]; [Siege-Class]; +5 Defense; allies within 1 zone gain +3 Soak; immune to all control effects |
