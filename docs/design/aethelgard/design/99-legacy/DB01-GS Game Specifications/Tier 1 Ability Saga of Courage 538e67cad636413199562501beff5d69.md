## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Saga of Courage is the Skald's **signature defensive Performance**—a channeled buff that protects the entire party from fear effects while bolstering mental resilience. This establishes the Skald's role as the party's **morale anchor**.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Party-wide fear immunity and WILL enhancement
- **Secondary:** Trauma Economy protection (prevents Psychic Stress from fear sources)
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The inspirational bard who steels allies' hearts with tales of ancient heroes

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High for Tier 1 (justified by channeling requirement)
- **Counterplay:** Skald can be [Silenced] or [Stunned] to end the Performance
- **Opportunity Cost:** While [Performing], Skald cannot use Standard Actions

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Skald begins to recite the **Saga of the Unbroken**—a chronicle of heroes who faced the horrors of the Glitch and did not flinch. The words themselves seem to push back against the Great Silence, creating a bubble of narrative coherence where fear cannot take root.

### Thematic Resonance

In Aethelgard, fear is not mere emotion—it is a **contagion of incoherence**. The Runic Blight weaponizes terror, using it to fragment minds. The Saga of Courage is a linguistic firewall, a story so compelling that it overwrites the corrupted fear response with tales of defiance.

1. **Pre-Boss Activation:** Start Performance before engaging fear-heavy bosses (Forlorn, Draugr Lords)
2. **Exploration Protection:** Maintain during Blight-saturated areas to reduce party Psychic Stress
3. **Panic Prevention:** Counter enemy abilities that mass-inflict [Feared]

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Skjaldmær (Bastion of Sanity):** Combined Psychic Stress reduction makes party nearly immune to mental damage
- **Berserkr:** Allows Berserkr to fight without fear penalties despite low WILL
- **Jötun-Reader:** Protects analyst while they accumulate self-inflicted Psychic Stress
- **High-WILL Builds:** Duration scales with WILL, making investment doubly valuable

### Negative Synergies

- **Solo Play:** Party-wide buff is wasted without allies
- **Quick Encounters:** Activation cost may not be worth it for short fights
- **[Silence] Heavy Enemies:** Vulnerable to counter-play
