### **I. Core Philosophy: The System Pathologist**

The **Jötun-Reader** is the Adept specialization that embodies the philosophy that the world's crash must be **observed and documented to be survived**. They are **System Pathologists** and **field diagnosticians** who approach the Runic Futhark and pre-crash technology as a dead patient on an autopsy table.

Their power comes from **reading the Old World's death throes**. They can translate runic inscriptions, identify structural weaknesses in corrupted systems, and speak fragments of command-line code—but these are forensic tools, not acts of creation.

### **II. Player-Facing Presentation**

- **Role:** Tactical Analyst, System Debugger, Lore Master
- **Primary Attribute:** WITS (for analysis and deciphering)
- **Secondary Attribute:** FINESSE (for interacting with ancient mechanisms)
- **Gameplay Feel:** Pure, dedicated non-combat support. Cerebral and methodical, rewarding patient observation and puzzle-solving. The party's force multiplier through pure information.

### **III. Mechanical Implementation: The Art of the Debugger**

**A. Core Mechanic: Diagnostic Observation**

- Superior version of Adept's basic `Analyze` command
- Reads symptoms, observes failure states, documents vulnerabilities
- **Cannot repair or recreate** what they study—purely observational
- **Psychic Cost:** Direct observation of corrupted processes inflicts Psychic Stress

**B. Core Mechanic: Runic Translation**

- Only non-Mystic with deep training in reading (not casting) the Futhark
- Translates inscriptions and reads command-line syntax as forensic linguist

### **IV. The Skill Tree: The Analyst's Toolkit**

**Tier 1 (Foundational Analysis)**

- **Scholarly Acumen I** (Passive) — Bonus to System Bypass and investigation
- **Analyze Weakness** (Active) — Reveals enemy Resistances/Vulnerabilities
- **Runic Linguistics** (Passive) — Translate non-magical runic inscriptions

**Tier 2 (Advanced Tactical Support)**

- **Exploit Design Flaw** (Active) — Applies [Analyzed] debuff (+2 Accuracy for allies)
- **Navigational Bypass** (Active) — Party bonus to avoid/disarm traps
- **Structural Insight** (Passive) — Auto-detect unstable structures and cover

**Tier 3 (Mastery of Lore)**

- **Calculated Triage** (Passive) — +25% healing from consumables near Jötun-Reader
- **The Unspoken Truth** (Active) — Knowledge attack inflicting [Disoriented]

**Capstone**

- **Architect of the Silence** (Active) — Speaks original command syntax to inflict [Seized] on Jötun-Forged/Undying

### **V. Systemic Integration**

**Trauma Economy:** High-risk specialization. Most powerful abilities inflict Psychic Stress—the price of knowledge. Requires Bone-Setter or Skald support.
