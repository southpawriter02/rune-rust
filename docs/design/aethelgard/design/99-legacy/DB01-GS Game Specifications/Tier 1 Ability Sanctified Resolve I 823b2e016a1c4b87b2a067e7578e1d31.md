## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Sanctified Resolve I establishes the Skjaldmær's identity as a **mental fortress**. Before she can protect others, she must be unshakeable herself. This foundational passive ensures the Skjaldmær resists fear and Psychic Stress from the moment of specialization unlock.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Bonus die to WILL-based Resolve Checks vs [Fear] and Psychic Stress
- **Secondary:** Establishes tank identity as protector of both body and mind
- **Progression Hook:** Foundation for Tier 2+ abilities that project protection to allies

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Moderate for Tier 1 passive
- **Comparison:** Similar to Skald's Oral Tradition I but focused on mental defense rather than social skills
- **Scaling:** Bonus die becomes increasingly valuable as Psychic Stress threats escalate

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Skjaldmær's training begins not with shield drills, but with **mental fortification**. She learns to ground her spirit, finding a quiet center amidst the world's chaotic noise. The screaming static of the Great Silence, the whispers of the Forlorn—these wash over her like waves against a cliff. She does not fight them; she simply *is*, unmoved.

### Thematic Resonance

In Aethelgard, fear is a contagion—a viral code that fragments coherent minds. The Skjaldmær's first lesson is to become immune to that contagion. Her shield is useless if her mind shatters first.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Effect

**Permanent Passive Bonus:**

- Gain **+1 bonus die (+1d10)** to all **WILL-based Resolve Checks** against:
    - [Fear] status effects
    - Psychic Stress from any source

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Trigger:** Skjaldmær must make Resolve Check vs [Fear] or Psychic Stress
2. **Validation:** System confirms Sanctified Resolve I is active
3. **Application:** Add +1d10 to the dice pool before rolling
4. **Resolution:** Proceed with standard Resolve Check resolution

### Edge Cases

- **Stacks with Equipment:** Yes, bonus die stacks with equipment bonuses
- **Stacks with Other Abilities:** Yes, stacks with Skald's Saga of Courage and similar buffs
- **Affected by Status Effects:** No—passive is always active unless Skjaldmær is [Unconscious]
- **Self-inflicted Stress:** Does apply when resisting self-inflicted Psychic Stress (e.g., from Guardian's Taunt)

---

## IV. Progression Path

### Rank 1 (Base — This Ability)

- +1 bonus die to Resolve Checks vs [Fear] and Psychic Stress

### Rank 2 (Expert — 20 PP)

*Future Enhancement: Sanctified Resolve II*

- +2 bonus dice to Resolve Checks vs [Fear] and Psychic Stress
- Automatically succeed on first [Fear] Resolve Check per combat

### Rank 3 (Mastery — Capstone)

*Future Enhancement: Sanctified Resolve III*

- +3 bonus dice to Resolve Checks vs [Fear] and Psychic Stress
- Immunity to [Fear] from non-boss sources
- First Psychic Stress event per combat is reduced by 5

## V. Tactical Applications

1. **Mental Tank:** Skjaldmær can absorb fear-inducing attacks without losing effectiveness
2. **Blight Exploration:** Increased resistance to environmental Psychic Stress in corrupted areas
3. **Boss Fights:** Better positioned to resist fear auras and psychological attacks
4. **Frontline Stability:** Never breaks formation due to fear
5. **Guardian's Taunt Synergy:** Helps resist self-inflicted Stress from Tier 2 taunt

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Skald (Saga of Courage):** Stacking bonuses create near-immunity to fear
- **Skjaldmær abilities (Guardian's Taunt):** Mitigates self-inflicted Stress costs
- **High-WILL builds:** Bonus die multiplies value of WILL investment
- **Front Row positioning:** Essential for maintaining tank presence under pressure

### Negative Synergies

- **Low-threat encounters:** Overkill for fights without fear/Stress mechanics
- **Pure physical damage builds:** No direct combat benefit
