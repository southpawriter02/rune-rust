## Assembled Entry

### §1. Identification and Pre-Glitch Origin

The creature known colloquially as the Skrap-Troll—or Mountain-That-Walks in Jötun-Born skaldic tradition—represents one of the most paradigmatic cases of post-Glitch purpose-inversion documented in the Aethelgard fauna catalogue. Layer 3 archives identify the baseline organism as the Hrungnir-Class Geo-Demolition Unit, a silicon-based megafauna bio-engineered by the Vanir Collective for brute-force excavation and infrastructure demolition during the Age of Forging.

The original design parameters reveal a creature optimized for obedience over cognition: a silicon-calcium bio-lithic hide capable of mineral absorption and self-reinforcement, coupled with a deliberately simplified neural architecture (minimal cognition, maximum docility). Pre-Glitch handlers issued simple command protocols—SMASH, CLEAR, CARRY—and the Hrungnir units obeyed.

The Ginnungagap Glitch terminated all Aesir command infrastructure. The surviving units experienced this as sudden, irrecoverable purposelessness. Without handlers to direct them, the creatures reverted to baseline instincts: consume minerals, seek shelter, sleep. Their complex industrial purpose—forgotten. Their simple territorial aggression—amplified.

### §2. The Second Skin: Adaptive Exaptation

Post-Glitch environmental conditions introduced a new dietary component: industrial scrap. The creatures' robust digestive systems, designed for processing stone, proved capable of partially metabolizing metallic alloys. However, larger fragments cannot be fully digested.

Specimen analysis (Report ID: SKRL-82-JOTUN) documents the four-phase digestive mechanism:

1. Mechanical grinding via peristaltic action and crystalline nodules
2. Acidic dissolution of ferrous oxides and softer alloys (pH 1.2-1.8)
3. Absorption of soluble minerals into bloodstream for hide reinforcement
4. Extrusion of indigestible fragments through dermal pores

During Phase 4, the creature secretes a bio-alchemical bonding agent—a silicon-calcium slurry with trace Blight-catalyzed polymers—that fuses extruded metal fragments to the dermal matrix at molecular level. The result: permanent armor integration. Fragments cannot be removed without destroying the hide itself.

The Jötun-Born sagas capture this process with characteristic mythic economy: *"They ate the rust and the ruin. And the ruin clung to them."* The Skrap-Troll now wears the dead machines as a second skin—armor forged not by smiths but by its own gut and grief.

### §3. Territorial Behavior and Threat Profile

Long-range monitoring surveys (Survey ID: SKRL-BEHAV-782/783-GAMMA) document the following behavioral parameters across 14 individuals observed over 427 days:

**Territorial Range:**
- Territory size: 8-15 km² per individual (larger for elder specimens)
- Boundary markers: Crushed machinery, boulder piles, deep gouge-marks in rock faces
- Overlap tolerance: Minimal; encounters between adults result in violent confrontation

**Detection and Response:**
- Visual detection range: ~150m
- Auditory detection range: ~200m
- Vibrational detection (ground tremor): ~300m
- Awareness-to-Assault escalation: 45-90 seconds (faster for larger specimens)
- Pursuit distance: Rarely exceeds 500m; abandons chase if target exits perceived territory

This final parameter represents the critical survival insight: the Skrap-Troll is not relentless. It guards its territory with extreme violence but will not pursue beyond perceived boundaries. Rangers planning salvage routes through Jötunheim should maintain 200m minimum standoff in high-density zones and exploit the 500m pursuit threshold for emergency extraction.

### §4. Economic Significance: The Dvergr Calculation

The Dvergr maintain a complex, pragmatic relationship with Skrap-Trolls—viewing them simultaneously as dangerous pests and mobile mineral repositories.

**The Problem:** A wandering troll can collapse an active mine in minutes. Their lithophagic instincts draw them toward excavation sites, where they may consume support structures or trigger catastrophic tunnel failures.

**The Prize:** The metal fragments fused into an elder troll's hide are often rare Pre-Glitch alloys that have been effectively "pre-processed" by the creature's digestive system. Dermal core analysis (Report ID: SKRL-81-JOTUN) recovered three fragments of Titanium-Orichalcum composite—a Pre-Glitch alloy of exceptional purity. Estimated salvage value: 40-60 Cog-Units per elder specimen, minus extraction costs and mortality risk.

Dvergr hunting parties sometimes seek out and kill particularly well-armored trolls for this material, treating it as a form of high-risk "mobile mining." The economic incentive is real; the mortality rate is not trivial.

### §5. Cultural Context: Pity for the Abandoned

The Jötun-Born—who share with the Skrap-Trolls a silicon-modified biology inherited from Vanir engineering—view the creatures as tragic kin rather than monsters. The saga "The Second Skin" encodes this doctrine explicitly:

> *"Pity the Skrap-Troll, stone-kin.*
> *It is not evil.*
> *It is abandoned.*
> *It guards nothing but its loneliness,*
> *and strikes only because*
> *it has forgotten how to serve."*

This perspective shapes Jötun-Born encounter doctrine: avoid rather than hunt, respect territorial boundaries, and acknowledge—in the creatures' purposeless aggression—a mirror of what all engineered beings became when the Forgers fell silent.

### §6. Diagnostic Conclusion

The Skrap-Troll is not a monster. It is a tool that outlived its purpose—a living wrecking ball that has learned to clothe itself in the bones of the civilization it was built to dismantle. The diagnostic value of this species lies not in its threat profile (moderate) or its economic significance (variable), but in its status as living testimony to the Ginnungagap Event's aftermath.

Every Skrap-Troll wandering the Ash-Blown Wastes is a seven-hundred-year-old artifact of purpose-inversion—still performing the only function it remembers (guard, consume, survive), still waiting for orders that will never come.
