## WRITING GUIDELINES

### Magic Flavor Principles

1. **Sensory richness** - describe sight, sound, temperature, sensation
2. **Power implied** - magic should feel potent and dangerous
3. **Cost evident** - casting takes effort, failure has consequences
4. **School identity** - each rune school feels distinct
5. **Escalation** - success levels feel progressively more impressive

### Tone by Success Level

- **Minor Success**: Adequate, workable, room for improvement
- **Solid Success**: Confident, effective, satisfying
- **Exceptional Success**: Impressive, masterful, awe-inspiring
- **Failure/Miscast**: Dangerous, costly, humbling

### Avoid

- Magic feeling trivial or easy
- Identical descriptions for different spells
- Mechanical-only descriptions
- Breaking immersion with game terms in flavor text
- Miscasts that only inconvenience (they should have weight)
