  "Name": "[The Fungal Garden]",
  "Description": "Symbiotic Plate has consumed this chamber. Walls pulsate with living fungal masses. The air is thick with spores - you can see them drifting in the emergency lighting like toxic snow. What was once a maintenance bay is now a biological nightmare, every surface coated in wet, breathing growth.",
  "Archetype": "Chamber",
  "SuggestedNodeType": "Main",
  "NarrativeText": "The Symbiotic Plate infestation is far more advanced here than anywhere else in [The Roots]. The fungal colony has developed primitive sensory organs - you can feel it watching you. The spores in the air make your head swim with alien thoughts.",
  "FlavorText": "Pustules on the walls leak luminescent fluid. You hear faint clicking sounds - the fungus communicating with itself. A Pre-Glitch warning sign barely visible through the growth reads: 'QUARANTINE - BIOLOGICAL HAZARD - DO NOT ENTER'",
