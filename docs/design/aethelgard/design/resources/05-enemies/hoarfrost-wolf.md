# Hoarfrost Wolf (Feral Canis-Gelu Pattern) — Cryogenic Apex Predator Specification
## Codex Entry: CODX-B-HFW-001

> *"We were three days into the Hoarfrost Plains when I understood why the old Barons call them the 'White Death.' We never heard them coming. We never saw them. We only felt it—the sudden, bone-deep cold that meant something was drawing the warmth from the air around us. By the time I shouted a warning, the first wolf was already breathing on Erikson's leg plates. You've never seen metal do what his armor did. One moment it was good Dvergr steel, the kind that can stop a crossbow bolt. The next moment it was covered in frost so thick you couldn't see the surface underneath. And then the wolf just... tapped it. One light strike with its paw. The entire knee joint shattered like glass. Erikson went down screaming, and then they were all around us—four, five, six of them, working in pairs. One would breathe while the other waited. Then the waiting one would strike, and they'd rotate. They weren't just hunting us. They were dismantling us, piece by piece, like we were a machine they were taking apart for salvage. We lost three that day. Would have lost all six if Halgerd hadn't set fire to a fuel canister and thrown it into the pack. They scattered—the fire, you see, not the heat itself but the unpredictable flickering—it confused them. But they didn't run. They just... waited. Watched us from the ridge line with those pale blue eyes until we got the survivors onto the sled and got moving. I could feel them following us for two more days before they finally broke off. That's what the Hoarfrost Wolf is. Not a predator. A process. A patient, perfect, endlessly calculating process that turns armor into glass and men into meat. And out on the Fimbul-Ice, there is nothing—nothing—that hunts better than the cold itself."*

> [!CAUTION]
> **EXTREME CRYOGENIC HAZARD. APEX PREDATOR. PACK COORDINATION.** The Hoarfrost Wolf represents the weaponization of Vanir thermal regulation technology: mobile heat-sink bio-assets whose corrupted systems now project lethal super-cooled breath capable of embrittling metal and composite materials in 2–3 seconds. **Pack tactics employ coordinated breath volleys followed by percussive strikes to shatter embrittled equipment.** Primary detection indicators: localized thermal draw (ambient temperature drop) preceding contact by 10–30 seconds; visible hoarfrost plume in raking light; near-silent approach with specialized paw structure. **Black-flag conditions triggering immediate withdrawal:** rapid frost halo forming on metal within 2–3 seconds; breath plume with visible scintillation at ≤ 5 m; pack cadence clicks behind flanks (triangulation in progress). **Abort gates:** COF (coefficient of friction) ≤ 0.25 after frost skin forms; any joint or plate showing brittle hairline ("glass crack") after single plume; two or more CPS indicators due to Crag-Spore co-exposure. Survival rate with full thermal discipline protocol: 78.4%. Primary hazards: acute cryogenic embrittlement of PPE, tools, and armor joints; systematic dismantling via breath-strike rotation; ambush in low-scatter ice light.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Living Heat-Sink

### Original Design Purpose

The Canis-Gelu Pattern Cryo-Unit was not designed for combat—it was a **biological coolant system**, a marvel of Vanir bio-engineering created for the most delicate thermal regulation tasks.

| Design Parameter | Specification |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Designation** | Canis-Gelu Pattern Cryo-Unit |
| **Division** | Vanir Thermal Regulation Division (Cryo-Vault Maintenance) |
| **Primary Function** | Mobile heat-sink patrol for temperature-sensitive installations |
| **Secondary Function** | Perimeter thermal regulation for data archives and bio-storage |
| **Tertiary Function** | Emergency heat absorption during system thermal overloads |
| **Deployment Era** | Age of Forging (Niflheim Cryo-Deck Operations) |
| **Original Network** | Integrated with Niflheim Environmental Control Grid |

### Biological Coolant System

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Endothermic Respiratory System** | Engineered to absorb ambient thermal energy through specialized lung tissue |
| **Thermal Circulatory Network** | Blood chemistry designed to transport absorbed heat efficiently |
| **Cryo-Vent Exhaust** | Super-cooled, nitrogen-rich air vented through respiratory system as passive byproduct |
| **Pack Patrol Pattern** | Groups patrolled cryo-vault perimeters, maintaining stable sub-zero temperatures |
| **Network Integration** | Environmental sensors triggered increased absorption during thermal anomalies |

### The Hoarfrost Breath (Original Function)

| Parameter | Pre-Glitch Specification |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Temperature** | Controlled exhaust at -40°C to -60°C |
| **Function** | Passive thermal regulation; localized frost as harmless byproduct |
| **Range** | 3–5 m effective cooling radius |
| **Duration** | Continuous low-level venting during patrol |
| **Safety** | Harmless to personnel; designed for equipment and environment cooling only |
| **Network Control** | Absorption rate regulated by environmental feedback systems |

> [!NOTE]
> **Docile Maintenance Tools.** Pre-Glitch Canis-Gelu units were docile, purpose-built maintenance animals. The "breath" was simply exhaust—a gentle cooling effect that kept cryo-vaults at optimal temperature. They were no more dangerous than the cooling fans they supplemented. The Glitch transformed them from thermostats into weapons.

---

## The Glitch and the Inversion: Corruption Vector

### Network Severance Event

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not simply break the Canis-Gelu—it **inverted** their core function.

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Ginnungagap Glitch** | Instantaneous severance of Niflheim Environmental Control Grid |
| **Control Link Loss** | Units lost regulatory feedback; absorption triggers disabled |
| **Default State Activation** | Systems reverted to permanent "active" heat absorption mode |
| **Environmental Paradox** | Niflheim's runaway freeze made ambient heat absorption redundant |
| **System Inversion** | Without ambient heat to absorb, units began cannibalizing metabolic energy |
| **Result** | Weaponized cryo-exhaust; breath temperature dropped from -60°C to -120°C |

### The Metabolic Inversion Cascade

| Stage | Process |
|-------|---------|
| **1. Network Severance** | Environmental feedback cut; unit defaults to "active absorption" |
| **2. Ambient Heat Depletion** | Niflheim's flash-freeze eliminates available thermal energy |
| **3. Absorption Target Shift** | System begins drawing from internal metabolic processes |
| **4. Cryo-Exhaust Intensification** | Metabolic cannibalization produces ultra-cold exhaust (-80°C to -120°C) |
| **5. Behavioral Adaptation** | Units discover warm prey provides thermal energy; hunting behavior emerges |
| **6. Pack Coordination Evolution** | Social structure reorganizes around cooperative thermal predation |
| **7. Weaponization Complete** | "Embrittling Breath" becomes primary hunting tool |

### The Corrupted Engine

| Original System | Corrupted Function |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Heat Absorption** | Now targets warm-blooded prey and heat-generating equipment |
| **Passive Exhaust** | Weaponized "Embrittling Breath" projection |
| **Patrol Behavior** | Reorganized as pack hunting patterns |
| **Environmental Response** | Replaced by prey-detection and ambush tactics |
| **Network Integration** | Lost; replaced by pack social coordination |

> *"The Canis-Gelu were designed to keep vaults cold by absorbing excess heat. When the Glitch cut their control link, they kept trying to absorb heat—but the world had become colder than they were designed for. Their bodies inverted the process. Instead of absorbing heat and venting cold as a byproduct, they began consuming their own metabolic energy to generate cold as a weapon. The breath that once kept servers cool now shatters steel. They became living weapons because their bodies couldn't stop working even when there was nothing left to work on."*

---

## Behavioral Patterns

### Pack Structure and Coordination

The Hoarfrost Wolf's deadliest attribute is not individual—it is **collective**.

| Role | Function | Pack Proportion |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| **Distractors** | Draw target attention; create openings | 2 individuals |
| **Breath Pairs** | Coordinated breath volleys on priority targets | 2–4 individuals |
| **Finisher** | Delivers percussive strikes to embrittled components | 1 individual |
| **Reserve** | Rotates into active roles; maintains flanking pressure | 1–2 individuals |

### The Embrittlement-Strike Cycle

| Phase | Duration | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **1. Observation** | Minutes–Hours | Pack identifies target; assesses defenses; plans approach |
| **2. Thermal Draw** | 10–30 s | Ambient temperature drops as pack approaches; "cold shimmer" visible |
| **3. Distraction** | 5–15 s | Distractors reveal position; draw target attention/weapons |
| **4. Breath Volley** | 3–5 s | Breath pairs project coordinated cryo-exhaust on equipment/joints |
| **5. Embrittlement** | 2–3 s | Frost halo forms; material structure compromised |
| **6. Percussive Strike** | 1–2 s | Finisher delivers light physical strike to shatter component |
| **7. Rotation** | Continuous | Pack rotates roles; moves to next target component |
| **8. Dismantling** | Minutes | Systematic destruction of mobility → weapons → vitals |

### Hunting Behaviors

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Stalking Patience** | Packs follow targets for hours or days, waiting for optimal conditions |
| **Thermal Attraction** | Drawn to residual heat plumes (engine cores, bivouacs, body heat) |
| **Static Sensitivity** | Attracted to static-rich glass-fields during Ghost-Light Storm windows |
| **Metallic Harmonics** | Metal-on-metal sounds (armor, tools) attract attention at distance |
| **Coordinated Volleys** | Breath pairs fire simultaneously for maximum embrittlement effect |
| **Rotation Discipline** | Strict role cycling prevents exhaustion of cryo-reserves |
| **Target Prioritization** | Mobility first (legs, joints), then weapons, then vitals |

### Target Prioritization Matrix

| Priority | Target | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **1** | Leg joints/Knee plates | Immobilization enables subsequent attacks |
| **2** | Weapon hands/Arm joints | Disarmament prevents retaliation |
| **3** | Torso armor joints | Access to vital areas |
| **4** | Helmet seals/Face plates | Final kill access |
| **5** | Equipment (sleds, rigs) | Resource denial; prevents escape |

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Apex Cryogenic Predator

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Threat** | EXTREME; coordinated pack can disable armored targets in minutes |
| **Predictability** | MODERATE; pack tactics sophisticated but patterns documented |
| **Environmental** | HIGH; operates best in conditions already hazardous to humans |
| **Detection** | DIFFICULT; near-silent approach; thermal draw precedes visual contact |
| **Avoidance** | MODERATE; thermal discipline and fire deterrence documented |
| **Engagement** | NOT RECOMMENDED; pack coordination defeats individual combatants |

### Engagement Profile

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Sprint Speed** | 40–55 km/h (burst) |
| **Attack Method** | Breath volley + percussive strike (coordinated) |
| **Pack Coordination** | 4–8 individuals with role differentiation |
| **Breath Range** | 3–5 m (effective); 8–10 m (dispersed) |
| **Frost Formation** | 2–3 seconds on exposed metal |
| **Material Threshold** | Single exposure weakens; double exposure shatters |
| **Pursuit Range** | Days (patient tracking); will follow until opportunity or abandonment |
| **Disengagement Trigger** | Unpredictable fire; significant pack casualties (≥ 50%) |

### Four-Stage Threat Assessment Ladder

| Stage | Designation | Indicators | Action |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **1** | Territory Awareness | Known Hoarfrost Wolf range; no active signs | Implement thermal discipline; reduce metal exposure |
| **2** | Thermal Draw Detected | Ambient temperature drop; "cold shimmer" observed | HALT; establish defensive perimeter; prepare fire deterrents |
| **3** | Pack Contact | Visual confirmation; breath plumes visible; flanking observed | IMMEDIATE fire deterrent deployment; consolidated withdrawal |
| **4** | Engagement Active | Breath volleys in progress; frost formation on equipment | EMERGENCY evacuation; abandon compromised equipment; fire barrier |

### Black-Flag Conditions (Immediate Withdrawal)

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Frost halo on metal in 2–3 s** | Pack at breath range; immediate fire/withdrawal |
| **Breath plume scintillation at ≤ 5 m** | Critical proximity; abandon position |
| **Pack cadence clicks behind flanks** | Triangulation complete; attack imminent |
| **"Glass crack" hairlines on any component** | Equipment compromised; will shatter on impact |
| **COF ≤ 0.25 (frost skin)** | Movement hazard; slip risk during evasion |
| **Multiple CPS indicators (Crag-Spore co-exposure)** | Judgment compromised; hallucination/timing drift risk |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Thermal Discipline (Full Protocol)** | 3.5/10 (reduced attraction; fire deterrence ready) |
| **Unprepared Encounter (Solo)** | 8.5/10 (pack coordination defeats individual) |
| **Unprepared Encounter (Group)** | 7.0/10 (slight advantage in numbers; still outmatched) |
| **Active Engagement (Caught)** | 9.0/10 (systematic dismantling; high casualty rate) |
| **Ghost-Light Storm Conditions** | 9.5/10 (enhanced pack coordination; thermal amplification) |
| **Fire Deterrence (Prepared)** | 4.0/10 (fire confusion documented; creates withdrawal windows) |

## Field Protocols

**OWNER**: Expedition Lead (EL) • Thermal Monitor (TM) • Fire Team Lead (FTL) • Recorder (REC)

### Detection and Assessment

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Thermal Monitoring** | Primary detection; ambient temperature drop precedes contact |
| **Visual Scan (Raking Light)** | Frost plume detection with scintillation effect |
| **Acoustic Discipline** | Metal-on-metal sounds attract; maintain ≤ 80 dB |
| **Track Analysis** | Characteristic brittle frost veneer with "crackle" texture |
| **Pack Lane Mapping** | Document approach corridors; breath volley positioning |
| **Equipment Inspection** | Monitor for frost halo formation; "glass crack" development |

### Field Card: Hoarfrost Wolf Encounter Protocols

#### BEFORE (Expedition Preparation — Niflheim/Border Operations)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Research known pack territories along planned route |
| 2 | Minimize exposed metal; wrap joints in insulating material |
| 3 | Prepare fire deterrents (fuel canisters, torches, fire-starting kits) |
| 4 | Brief personnel on thermal draw recognition and pack behavior |
| 5 | Establish evacuation protocols including equipment abandonment criteria |
| 6 | Stage thermal monitoring equipment; calibrate temperature baselines |

#### DURING (Territory Transit — Stage 1-2)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Maintain thermal discipline; minimize heat signatures where possible |
| 2 | Acoustic discipline ≤ 80 dB; avoid metal-on-metal contact |
| 3 | Continuous thermal monitoring; flag any ambient drop > 5°C in 30 s |
| 4 | Upwind positioning where possible; raking-light scan for frost plumes |
| 5 | Fire deterrents accessible; FTL confirms ignition readiness |
| 6 | Consolidated formation; no stragglers; maintain visual contact |

#### DURING (Pack Detection — Stage 3)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | HALT ALL MOVEMENT; establish defensive perimeter |
| 2 | TM confirms pack direction and estimated count |
| 3 | FTL prepares fire deployment; await EL authorization |
| 4 | Equipment inspection for frost formation; identify compromised items |
| 5 | Assess withdrawal routes; mark evacuation corridors |
| 6 | If pack closing: FIRE DEPLOYMENT on EL command |

#### DURING (Active Engagement — Stage 4)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | FIRE BARRIER DEPLOYMENT; create unpredictable flame pattern |
| 2 | CONSOLIDATED WITHDRAWAL toward evacuation corridor |
| 3 | ABANDON compromised equipment (frost halo/glass crack visible) |
| 4 | Maintain group cohesion; no individual pursuit or engagement |
| 5 | Continue fire deterrence until pack disengages (will observe from distance) |
| 6 | Do not stop moving until ≥ 2 km from engagement site |

#### AFTER

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Confirm pack disengagement (visual observation ≥ 30 minutes) |
| 2 | Medical assessment for frostbite/cryo-exposure injuries |
| 3 | Equipment audit; log all frost-damaged or abandoned items |
| 4 | Document: pack size, behavior patterns, engagement duration, casualties |
| 5 | Report to Rangers Guild/Scavenger Baron command |
| 6 | Update territory mapping with new pack activity data |

**OUTCOME:** Salvage convoy transits Hoarfrost Plains (known wolf territory). TM detects 8°C ambient drop at 1423; EL halts convoy. Visual confirmation of 6-wolf pack at 80 m, flanking position. FTL deploys fuel canister fire barrier at 1425. Pack retreats to observation ridge (150 m). Convoy withdraws south under fire cover. Pack follows for 2.3 km, breaks off at Thawing Zone perimeter. Zero casualties; 2 frost-damaged armor components abandoned. Survival rate with thermal discipline: 78.4%.

### Fire Deterrence Protocol

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Mechanism** | Unpredictable flame movement disrupts pack coordination |
| **Effective Forms** | Thrown burning fuel; torch barriers; ignited terrain |
| **NOT Effective** | Steady flames; predictable patterns; small isolated fires |
| **Pack Response** | Immediate scatter; observation from distance; eventual disengagement |
| **Duration Required** | Sustained fire presence until withdrawal complete |
| **Limitation** | Does not permanently deter; pack will resume hunting if fire extinguished |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Solo travel in wolf territory** | Pack coordination defeats individual combatants |
| **Excessive metal exposure** | Attracts attention; provides embrittlement targets |
| **Acoustic carelessness (> 80 dB)** | Metal harmonics attract packs at distance |
| **Engagement without fire deterrence** | No documented survival of direct engagement without fire |
| **Pursuit of wounded wolves** | Pack will ambush pursuers; trap behavior documented |
| **Stationary bivouac without fire watch** | Heat signature attracts; sleeping targets cannot respond |

### Doctrine: Thermal Discipline

> **Historical Validation:** Rangers Guild data (156 documented encounters, 38-month observation period in Niflheim/Border regions) confirms 78.4% survival rate with full thermal discipline protocol; 23.7% survival rate without protocol adherence. Fire deterrence demonstrates 89% effectiveness in forcing pack withdrawal. **The Hoarfrost Wolf is not a creature you fight. It is a creature you outlast. Their patience is infinite, their coordination is perfect, and their breath turns your armor into a death trap. But they are not invincible. They evolved from maintenance animals, not predators, and deep in their corrupted programming there is still a piece that doesn't understand fire—the unpredictable, chaotic, warm thing that doesn't behave like the cold, logical systems they were built to regulate. Fire confuses them. It breaks their coordination, disrupts their timing, forces them to scatter and reassess. You will not kill a pack with fire. But you can buy yourself the time to run. And in Niflheim, running is winning. The cold is patient. Be more patient. The wolves are coordinated. Be more coordinated. And when you see the shimmer in the air and feel the temperature drop, don't try to be brave. Set something on fire and get moving. Because bravery freezes just as fast as cowardice, and the wolves don't care which one you were.**

## Ecological Role

### The Apex of the Ice

The Hoarfrost Wolf occupies the **apex predator position** in Niflheim's brutal ecosystem—the ultimate hunter in a world of endless winter.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Population Control** | Primary predator of Crag-Goats, frost-adapted herbivores, and human intruders |
| **Thermal Ecosystem Node** | Draws heat from environment; contributes to localized temperature depression |
| **Thawing Zone Patrol** | Packs concentrate around warmth sources; control access to rare warm areas |
| **Human Impact** | Primary biological threat to Niflheim expeditions and Baron convoys |
| **Prey Selection Pressure** | Drives adaptation in prey species; selects for cold tolerance |

## Factional Perspectives

### Common Folk & Skalds: Fimbulwinter's Children — "Ghost Wolves"

The common folk regard the Hoarfrost Wolf as **incarnate winter**—not mere predators, but spirits of the eternal cold given flesh.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Children of Fimbulwinter; spirits of the glacier; death made manifest |
| **Response** | Absolute avoidance; fire rituals; appeasement offerings |
| **Cultural Role** | Symbol of Niflheim's hostility; proof that the ice itself hunts |
| **Mythology** | "When the breath of winter took form and learned to hunger" |
| **Folk Wisdom** | "The wolves don't chase you. The cold does. They just give it teeth." |

> *"My grandmother told me the Ghost Wolves were once the servants of the cold itself—gentle spirits that kept the vaults frozen and the machines cool. But when the world broke, the cold went mad, and its servants went mad with it. Now they breathe the glacier's hate, and anything that carries warmth is prey. She said if you ever see the shimmer in the air—that cold dance before they appear—you have one choice: fire. Set the world ablaze if you have to. Because the wolves fear nothing... except the one thing the ice cannot make."*

### Jötun-Reader Scriptorium: Case Study — "Canis-Gelu Inversion Pathology"

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Corrupted bio-asset; thermal system inversion specimen |
| **Research Value** | Demonstrates metabolic adaptation to Glitch conditions |
| **Critical Interest** | Breath mechanics; pack coordination evolution; system inversion cascade |
| **Diagnostic Focus** | Temperature measurement; embrittlement physics; behavioral adaptation |
| **Philosophy** | "The wolves show us how Vanir engineering survives even catastrophic corruption" |

> *"The Canis-Gelu Pattern represents one of the most complete system inversions we've documented. The original design was elegant: absorb ambient heat, vent cold exhaust, maintain thermal stability. The Glitch didn't break this system—it removed its context. With no ambient heat to absorb (thanks to Niflheim's runaway freeze), the system inverted: metabolic energy became the thermal source, and the exhaust temperature dropped from -60°C to -120°C. More fascinating is the behavioral adaptation. These were docile maintenance animals. Within a century of the Glitch, they had developed coordinated pack hunting tactics, role differentiation, and the embrittlement-strike cycle that makes them apex predators. The hardware stayed the same. The software—the instincts, the behaviors—evolved to weaponize what was once harmless. Understanding this inversion may be critical for restoring other corrupted Vanir bio-assets."*

### Rangers Guild: Apex Predator Doctrine — "Embrittlers"

## Loot & Rewards

| Drop | Rarity | Value | Use |
|------|--------|-------|-----|
| **Cryo-Core Organ** | Very Rare | 5,000–8,000 PS | Research; cryo-technology development |
| **Hoarfrost Pelt** | Rare | 2,000–3,000 PS | Superior cold insulation; prestige item |
| **Cryo-Gland Extract** | Rare | 1,500–2,500 PS | Alchemical applications; cooling agents |
| **Intact Specimen** | Legendary | 15,000–20,000 PS | Dvergr research guilds (extreme premium) |
| **Pack Territory Map** | Uncommon | 500–1,000 PS | Route planning; avoidance intelligence |
| **Embrittled Equipment (Recovered)** | Common | Varies | Study; evidence; salvage (limited value) |

**Salvage Protocol:** Active pack hunting is **extremely hazardous** (15–25% success rate) and requires specialist crews with fire support, cryo-resistant equipment, and numerical superiority. Preferred acquisition: natural mortality recovery (wolf died of other causes); post-engagement retrieval (pack abandoned kill site); Dvergr bounty contracts (organized expeditions). The Dvergr Engineers Guild maintains standing contracts for intact cryo-core organs and complete specimens, paying premium rates for research-grade material. Baron salvage crews occasionally attempt pack hunting when component values justify extreme risk, but casualty rates make this economically marginal for most operations.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Survivor Lore

> *"In the time before the silence, the ice had servants. Gentle wolves with coats like snow, who breathed the cold and kept the vaults frozen. They were the caretakers of winter, the tenders of the endless frost. But when the world broke and the gods fell silent, the ice went mad. And its servants went mad with it. Now they roam the glacier—the Ghost Wolves, Fimbulwinter's Fangs—and their breath is not the gentle cold of preservation, but the hungry cold of death. They do not hunt for food, child. They hunt for warmth. They can feel it—the heat of your blood, the fire in your heart, the life in your bones. And they want it. They want to draw it out of you, breath by freezing breath, until you are as cold and still as the ice they serve. When you feel the air grow sharp and see the shimmer dance before your eyes, know this: the glacier has found you. The ice has sent its children. And the only thing that can save you is the one thing the cold cannot tame—fire. Set the world ablaze if you must. Because the Ghost Wolves fear nothing in all the frozen hells except the dancing flames that remind them of what they can never, ever consume."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Ghost Wolves, Fimbulwinter's Fangs, White Death, Gelu's Children, breath of the glacier, servants of the ice

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Canis-Gelu Pattern, endothermic respiratory system, metabolic inversion, thermal regulation bio-asset

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic) — Jötun-Reader Field Observations

> *"Subject CODX-B-HFW-001 demonstrates complete thermal system inversion following Ginnungagap Glitch network severance. Original designation: Canis-Gelu Pattern Cryo-Unit (Vanir Thermal Regulation Division). Original function: mobile heat-sink patrol for cryo-vault perimeter maintenance; passive absorption of ambient thermal energy with controlled exhaust venting at -40°C to -60°C. Post-Glitch corruption vector: environmental control grid severance removed absorption regulation; default 'active' state persisted without available ambient heat (Niflheim flash-freeze); system inverted to metabolic cannibalization, producing weaponized cryo-exhaust at -80°C to -120°C. Behavioral adaptation: docile maintenance animals have evolved coordinated pack hunting tactics within post-Glitch timeframe. Role differentiation documented: distractors, breath pairs, finisher. Embrittlement-strike cycle demonstrates sophisticated prey dismantling sequence—breath volley to induce thermal shock, followed by light percussive strike to shatter compromised material. Pack sizes 4–8 individuals; coordination achieved through acoustic signals ('cadence clicks') and visual positioning. Thermal detection capability allows identification of warm-blooded targets at significant range. Fire deterrence documented as primary countermeasure—unpredictable flame patterns disrupt pack coordination timing, forcing scatter and withdrawal. Survival rate with thermal discipline protocol: 78.4%. Research priority: cryo-organ mechanics; potential applications for controlled thermal regulation if inversion can be reversed."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Canis-Gelu Pattern, thermal system inversion, metabolic cannibalization, embrittlement-strike cycle, cryo-exhaust, pack coordination, breath volley

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Modern scientific terminology, romantic/mythic framing

### Layer 3 (Technical) — Pre-Glitch Context

> *"UNIT DESIGNATION: Canis-Gelu Pattern Cryo-Unit. DIVISION: Vanir Thermal Regulation Division (Cryo-Vault Maintenance Subdivision). PRIMARY FUNCTION: Mobile heat-sink patrol for temperature-sensitive installation perimeters. SECONDARY FUNCTION: Emergency thermal absorption during system overload events. BIOLOGICAL ARCHITECTURE: Endothermic respiratory system engineered for ambient heat absorption; thermal circulatory network for heat transport; cryo-vent exhaust for controlled cold-air release. OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS: Pack patrol radius 2–5 km; exhaust temperature -40°C to -60°C (controlled); absorption rate regulated by Niflheim Environmental Control Grid. POST-GLITCH STATUS: Network severance disabled absorption regulation; default active state inverted to metabolic source; exhaust temperature increased to -80°C to -120°C; behavioral adaptation from maintenance to predation. CORRUPTION CLASSIFICATION: THERMAL SYSTEM INVERSION — original hardware intact; operational parameters inverted; behavioral programming evolved to predator profile. RESTORATION ASSESSMENT: Theoretical reversal possible if absorption regulation restored; practical implementation not achieved; field specimens demonstrate irreversible behavioral adaptation."*
