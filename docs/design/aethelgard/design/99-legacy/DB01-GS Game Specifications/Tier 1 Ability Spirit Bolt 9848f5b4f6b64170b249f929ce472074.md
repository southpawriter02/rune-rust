## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Spirit Bolt is the Seiðkona's **basic attack ability**—a focused lance of spiritual energy that allows them to contribute damage even when their utility abilities aren't needed. This ensures they remain combat-relevant without overshadowing their support identity.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Deal moderate Psychic damage to single target
- **Secondary:** Provide baseline combat contribution
- **Fantasy Delivery:** Channeling the voices of the dead into a weapon

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Moderate (standard damage, no special effects)
- **No Psychic Cost:** Basic attack doesn't strain sanity
- **Efficient:** Low AP cost for reliable damage
- **Support-Class Appropriate:** Damage without outshining dedicated attackers

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Seiðkona raises their hand, and the air around them grows cold. The dead are *always* with them—hovering at the edge of perception, whispering their endless grievances. Now, the Seiðkona gives them voice.

A bolt of pale, luminescent energy lances from their palm—not fire, not lightning, but **concentrated grief**. The spirits' rage, their sorrow, their desperate need to be remembered—all compressed into a single, searing projectile.

The target feels it not as heat, but as **cold**—the cold of the grave, the cold of being forgotten.

### Thematic Resonance

Spirit Bolt is the Seiðkona weaponizing their connection to the dead. They do not create energy; they *channel* it, giving the voiceless spirits a moment of expression through violence.
