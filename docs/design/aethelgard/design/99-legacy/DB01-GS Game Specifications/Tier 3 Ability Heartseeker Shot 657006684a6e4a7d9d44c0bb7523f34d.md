## Description

You draw your most powerful arrow, taking a full turn to steady your breath, read the wind, and calculate the perfect trajectory. You're not aiming for a vital organ—you're aiming for the metaphysical "core" of the target's corruption, the focal point where the Blight's chaotic code is most concentrated. This is the shot that defines you as a master hunter: one arrow, one kill.

## Mechanics

### Action Economy

| Phase | Action | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Turn 1 (Charge)** | Declare Heartseeker Shot, spend Standard Action aiming | — |
| **Turn 2 (Execute)** | Unleash charged shot | 35 Stamina |

### Charge Turn Restrictions

- Cannot move or take other actions
- Vulnerable to interruption (if attacked, Resolve check or lose the shot)

### Resolution

- **Attack:** FINESSE-based ranged attack
- **Base Damage:** 4d10 + FINESSE

### Bonus vs Marked Targets

If target has [Marked] debuff:

- Deal additional **+2d10 bonus damage**
- **Purge 10 points** of target's Runic Blight Corruption
- Represents your arrow "correcting" unstable code, forcing coherence

### Combined Potential

Against high-corruption marked target:

- **6d10 + FINESSE** damage
- **30% crit chance** (via Exploit Corruption)
- Potential **60-80+ damage** in a single hit

## Tactical Applications

### Boss Fights

1. Turn 1: Mark for Death (Free Action) + Set Snare to protect position
2. Turn 2: Begin Heartseeker Shot charge
3. Turn 3: Execute for massive damage

### Elite Encounters

- Use when high-value target is locked down by ally controller
- Traps protect you during vulnerable charge turn
- Exploit Corruption makes this near-guaranteed crit vs corrupted elites

### Risks

- Interruption during charge wastes stamina and turn
- Requires tank to protect you
- Overkill on weak targets (use Aimed Shot instead)

## Integration Notes

- **Ultimate Finisher:** Your highest single-target burst damage
- **Setup Required:** Best used after marking target and positioning safely
- **Corruption Purge:** Unique mechanic—you literally "debug" enemies with arrows
- **Boss Killer:** Designed for high-stakes single-target elimination
