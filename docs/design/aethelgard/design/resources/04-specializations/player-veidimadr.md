## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Skirmisher |
| **Role** | Ranged DPS / Corruption Tracker |
| **Path Type** | Coherent |
| **Primary Attribute** | FINESSE |
| **Secondary Attribute** | WITS |
| **Resource System** | Stamina + Focus |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | Medium |

The **Veiðimaðr** is the patient predator of a corrupted world.

They are not trophy hunters seeking glory in the kill. They are **Blight-Stalkers**—corridor curators and exposure managers who have learned to read the invisible signs of the Runic Blight like spoor. They understand that the more corrupted a creature is, the more unstable—and exploitable—it becomes.

They hunt not for sport but from grim necessity: **culling the most grievously Blighted beasts before the infection spreads**.

Their precision is their weapon against chaos. Where the Myrk-gengr vanishes into the static and the Berserkr charges screaming into the fray, the Veiðimaðr waits. They read. They mark. They loose with certainty. And then they relocate—because ghosts are not found by staying.

## Core Philosophy: The Art of the Hunt

### The Three Principles

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Patience Before Motion** | Read the sign twice before moving to removal |
| **Preparation Before Contact** | Power grows with planning—arrows set, snares built, vials measured |
| **One Arrow Where Others Spend a Storm** | Precision over volume; the perfect shot ends what a hundred swings cannot |

The Veiðimaðr's creed is not written in saga or scripture. It is written in the **language of spoor**—broken grass, feather, scat, oil, and the subtle tells of corruption that mark a creature's passage through a broken world.

> *"Read the Ledger: Spoor, broken grass, feather, scat, oil, and rumor form one account. Verify with second sign before moving to removal."*

This is not the hunting of the old sagas—no boasting of trophies, no glory in the kill. The Veiðimaðr understands that in the Age of Echoes, **waste invites famine and rumor**. They take only what preserves corridor herds and scavenger balances. They record wind, shot, dress site, taint signs, and ash marks.

Reproducibility and predictability keep roads open.

### The Coherent Path

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Source** | Skill and drill, not heresy |
| **Method** | Patient observation, precise execution |
| **Cost** | Moderate Psychic Stress from Mark for Death (focus is taxing) |
| **Philosophy** | The world's corruption is a weakness to exploit, not a power to embrace |

Unlike the Myrk-gengr who wraps themselves in corruption or the Rust-Witch who channels entropy, the Veiðimaðr maintains **coherent discipline**. They study the Blight without becoming part of it. They exploit corruption without accumulating it.

This is a sustainable path—demanding, but not self-destructive.

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Patient predator; the shot that ends the threat |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Mark → position → devastating precision shots from safety |
| **Success Metric** | Priority targets eliminated efficiently; corruption exploited |
| **Decision Space** | Target prioritization, trap placement, charged shot timing |

Playing a Veiðimaðr is about **reading the battlefield** and making surgical strikes.

You identify the highest-corruption target—the most dangerous, most unstable threat—and you mark it. From the safety of the back row, you deliver precision damage enhanced by your knowledge of the target's corrupted nature. Your charged Heartseeker Shot can purge corruption from a heavily Blighted foe, dealing devastating bonus damage in the process.

> *"You are the patient predator of a corrupted world. You've learned to read the invisible signs of the Runic Blight—the subtle tells that reveal a creature's corruption level. You mark high-priority targets, exploit their weaknesses, and deliver devastating shots from the safety of the back row."*

Your power scales with your enemy's corruption. The more Blighted the target, the more damage you deal. This makes you the ideal specialist for facing heavily corrupted enemies—the grievously infected beasts that others struggle to bring down.

## Abilities: The Hunter's Quiver

### Tier 1 — Foundational Marksmanship

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Wilderness Acclimation I** | Passive | — | +1d10 to WITS checks for tracking/foraging/perception; can identify Blighted creatures by spoor |
| **Aimed Shot** | Active | 40 Stamina | FINESSE-based ranged attack; bread-and-butter damage ability |
| **Set Snare** | Active | 35 Stamina + 1 Trap Component | Place concealed trap; first enemy to step on it becomes [Rooted] |

**Wilderness Acclimation I** represents the Veiðimaðr's almost instinctual ability to interpret the language of a corrupted natural world. They read sign that others cannot see—the subtle tells that distinguish healthy from Blighted, safe from dangerous.

At higher ranks, this passive allows estimation of corruption level (Low/Medium/High/Extreme) and automatic detection of Blighted items without touching them—critical for avoiding accidental Corruption when looting.

**Aimed Shot** is the bread-and-butter damage ability—reliable, efficient, consistent. It's not flashy, but it's the shot you'll use most often.

> *"You steady your breath, your focus absolute, and release a single, perfectly aimed shot. Pure, logical precision against a chaotic world."*

**Set Snare** is the art of the patient kill. In a world of chaotic, glitching monsters, the Veiðimaðr imposes a moment of order—wire and sinew laid fast, concealed beneath corrupted earth. When stepped, the ground bites and the mark is [Rooted].

### Tier 2 — Advanced Tracking and Tactics

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Mark for Death** | Active | 30 Stamina + 5 Psychic Stress | Apply [Marked] for 3 turns; your attacks deal +8 bonus damage vs marked target |
| **Blight-Tipped Arrow** | Active | 45 Stamina | 3d6 Physical damage + [Blighted Toxin] DoT; 40% [Glitch] chance vs corrupted targets |
| **Predator's Focus** | Passive | — | While in back row and not adjacent to enemies: +2d10 to Resolve vs Psychic Stress, +1d10 Perception |

**Mark for Death** is the predator's declaration of intent. This is not a magical curse—it is a moment of study, reading the subtle tells of the target's Blighted nature and marking it as the primary corruption to be cleansed.

The Psychic Stress cost (5) reflects the intense focus required. You're not just looking at the target—you're **reading its corruption**, understanding its instability, identifying its weaknesses. This is taxing.

> *"You focus your intent on a single target, observing the subtle tells of its Blighted nature. You mark it as the primary corruption to be cleansed."*

**Blight-Tipped Arrow** is the Veiðimaðr's specialized ammunition—shafts kissed with measured toxin that inflict [Blighted Toxin] DoT. Against corrupted targets, there's a chance to inflict [Glitch], causing the target to skip its next action as its corrupted systems fail.

**Predator's Focus** rewards proper positioning. From the back row, the Veiðimaðr gains enhanced mental resilience and perception—the calm clarity of the distant hunter watching the chaos unfold below.

### Tier 3 — Mastery of the Hunt

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Exploit Corruption** | Passive | — | Increased crit chance vs corrupted targets (scales with corruption level); +50% crit damage vs corrupted |
| **Heartseeker Shot** | Active | 60 Stamina + 30 Focus | Charged shot (full turn): 10d10 Physical; purge 20 Corruption for +2 damage per Corruption purged (max +40) |

**Exploit Corruption** is the Veiðimaðr's signature passive—the ability to read instability and exploit it.

| Corruption Level | Crit Chance Bonus |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Low (1-29) | +10% |
| Medium (30-59) | +20% |
| High (60-89) | +30% |
| Extreme (90+) | +40% |

> *"You have studied the Blight so long you can predict its chaotic influence. A corrupted creature is unstable—its form less coherent, more susceptible to system-shocking blows."*

Critical hits against corrupted targets deal +50% damage. If the critical kills the target, you refund 20 Stamina—the hunt continues.

**Heartseeker Shot** is the ultimate burst ability—a full turn of stillness to read wind, bone, and breath, then a release that hunts the deep places.

> *"You take a full turn to aim not for a vital organ, but for the metaphysical core of the target's corruption—the focal point of its glitching existence. Your stable arrow corrects unstable code."*

Against a [Marked] target, Heartseeker Shot purges Corruption, dealing +2 bonus damage per point of Corruption purged (max +40). Combined with Mark for Death's +15 bonus damage at Rank 3, this creates a devastating combo: 10d10 base + 15 (Mark) + 40 (purge) = **10d10 + 55 bonus damage**.

If this kills a [Marked] target, you refund 30 Stamina and 15 Focus.

### Capstone — Stalker of the Unseen

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Passive** | When you use Mark for Death, automatically learn target's Vulnerabilities and precise Corruption level |
| **Active (Toggle)** | Blight-Stalker's Stance: 20 Stamina/turn drain; enhanced tracking and corruption exploitation |

The capstone **Stalker of the Unseen** represents the ultimate expression of the Veiðimaðr philosophy—absolute mastery of corruption tracking.

When you mark a major foe, you don't just identify it as a target—you **read its entire corruption profile**. Vulnerabilities, precise Corruption level, weaknesses—all revealed by the act of marking.

The Blight-Stalker's Stance toggle provides enhanced combat capabilities at an ongoing Stamina cost. This is the sustained predator mode for extended encounters against heavily corrupted opposition.

## Systemic Integration

### Corruption Exploitation

| Enemy Corruption | Veiðimaðr Advantage |
|------------------|---------------------|
| **Low (1-29)** | +10% crit, minor Blight-Tipped Arrow bonus |
| **Medium (30-59)** | +20% crit, 60% [Glitch] chance |
| **High (60-89)** | +30% crit, 80% [Glitch] chance, Heartseeker purge bonus |
| **Extreme (90+)** | +40% crit, maximum purge damage, [Staggered] on crit |

The Veiðimaðr's power scales inversely with enemy health—the more corrupted the target, the more devastating the damage. This creates a unique niche: **the Blight-specialist** who excels precisely where other builds struggle.

Against heavily corrupted enemies, the Veiðimaðr's Exploit Corruption passive provides up to +40% crit chance, and Heartseeker Shot's corruption purge mechanic converts the enemy's Blight into bonus damage.

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Coherent (no negative Trauma interactions) |
| **Self-Inflicted Risk** | Medium (Mark for Death costs 5 Psychic Stress per use) |
| **Mitigation** | Predator's Focus provides +2d10 Resolve vs Psychic Stress while in back row |
| **Strategic Implication** | Sustainable DPS; can operate for extended encounters without spiral |

The Veiðimaðr is a **Coherent** specialization. Their power comes from skill, observation, and discipline—not from heretical bargains with corruption.

The Mark for Death Psychic Stress cost is significant but manageable. Predator's Focus provides built-in mitigation, and the Veiðimaðr's back-row positioning keeps them away from the worst sources of environmental Stress.

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Skjaldmær / Tank** | Held front grants clear lanes and safe breath; optimal back-row positioning |
| **Controllers** | Fear, stillness, and confusion widen clean-hit windows; Predator's Cunning pays out under control |
| **Galdr-Casters** | Signal partner for noise and light timing; hunts end quickly and quietly |
| **Bone-Setter** | Manages Psychic Stress from Mark for Death |

The Veiðimaðr is the **back-row general and lane shaper**—marking the high-value threat and cutting it clean while the front line holds.

> *"With Skjaldmær: a held front grants clear lanes and safe breath."*

### Positional Considerations

| Position | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Back Row** | Predator's Focus active; +2d10 Resolve, +1d10 Perception |
| **Front Row** | Predator's Focus inactive; increased danger |
| **Adjacent to Enemy** | Predator's Focus inactive; vulnerable to melee |

The Veiðimaðr is optimized for **back-row operation**. Their primary risk is being pulled forward into the press—mobility and positioning are critical.

## Lore Integration

### Social Function in Aethelgard

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Corridor Curator** | Removes corridor breakers and maps vector risks so caravans move |
| **Provisioner** | Provides clean meat and hides without fouling rumor or lanes |
| **Shield in the Brush** | Screens flanks for Skjaldmær and Atgeir-Wielders during resets and retreats |
| **Signal Partner** | Works with Galdr-Casters to time noise and light so hunts end quickly |

The Veiðimaðr is not a lone wolf or glory-seeker. They are a **public safety officer** whose quarry includes beasts, frames, and rumor-predators. Their function is corridor care—keeping the roads open by removing the threats that would close them.

> *"The Veiðimaðr is the track-keeper and exposure manager of the road. Rather than trophy-hunting, this role reads spoor and rumor as one ledger, mapping vector risks and culling threats that break corridors of travel."*

### Ethics and Risk Governance

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Do Not Trophize** | Waste invites famine and rumor |
| **Quotas and Seasons** | Take only what preserves corridor herds and scavenger balances |
| **Witness and Ledger** | Record wind, shot, dress site, taint signs, and ash marks |

The Veiðimaðr tradition formalized early in the Age of Walls, when caravans learned that indiscriminate hunting collapses routes. The hunters developed quotas, carcass handling protocols, and silence protocols to keep paths open.

This is not sport. This is **corridor maintenance**.

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Rangers Guild** | Essential partners; Veiðimenn provide specialized threat removal along trade routes |
| **Jötun-Readers** | Valued for their empirical observation methodology and corruption tracking data |
| **Iron-Banes** | Respected hunters; their discipline aligns with coherent, non-heretical practice |
| **Rust-Clans** | Appreciated provisioners; clean meat and hides without fouling trade lanes |
| **Bone-Setters** | Clinical coordination for quarantine support and exposure management |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the old tales, the greatest hunters were not the strongest or the loudest. They were the ones who knew where the beast would be before the beast knew itself. In the Age of Echoes, the beasts have changed. They glitch and shimmer with corruption, their forms unstable, their minds broken loops of predatory code. The Veiðimaðr learned to read these new signs—the tells of corruption that mark a creature for culling. They are the patient predators of a sick world, and their arrows do not merely kill. They purge. They cleanse. They remove the corruption that threatens the roads and the folk who walk them. One arrow where others would spend a storm. One shot to end what a hundred swings cannot. This is the art of the hunt in the Age of Echoes."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Veiðimaðr (Hunter/Blight-Stalker) represents the Coherent Skirmisher specialization optimized for ranged DPS and corruption exploitation. Mechanical role: sustained single-target damage dealer with corruption tracking capabilities. Key differentiator: power scales with enemy corruption level (up to +40% crit chance vs Extreme corruption). Core mechanic: Mark for Death targeting system enabling significant damage bonuses against priority targets. Signature ability: Heartseeker Shot (charged attack that purges corruption for bonus damage, up to +40). Social function: corridor curator and exposure manager—removes threats that break travel corridors, provides provisioning without fouling trade lanes. Trauma Economy interaction: Medium risk (Mark for Death costs 5 Psychic Stress); mitigated by Predator's Focus (+2d10 Resolve in back row). Optimal deployment: heavily corrupted encounters, boss fights, extended operations requiring sustainable DPS."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Veiðimaðr (Blight-Stalker). ARCHETYPE: Skirmisher. PATH TYPE: Coherent. ROLE: Ranged DPS / Corruption Tracker. PRIMARY STAT: FINESSE. SECONDARY STAT: WITS. RESOURCE: Stamina + Focus. CORE MECHANICS: Mark for Death ([Marked] status, +8/+12/+15 damage bonus), Exploit Corruption (crit chance scaling: +10%/+20%/+30%/+40% by corruption tier), Heartseeker Shot (10d10, purge 20 Corruption for max +40 damage). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Marksmanship): Wilderness Acclimation I, Aimed Shot, Set Snare. T2 (Advanced Tracking): Mark for Death, Blight-Tipped Arrow, Predator's Focus. T3 (Mastery): Exploit Corruption, Heartseeker Shot. CAPSTONE: Stalker of the Unseen (auto-learn vulnerabilities on Mark, Blight-Stalker's Stance toggle). OPTIMAL POSITION: Back Row. COUNTERS: Forced repositioning, flanking, anti-ranged mechanics. SYNERGIES: Tanks (clear lanes), Controllers (Predator's Cunning payoff), Signal partners (hunt timing)."*

## Summary

The Veiðimaðr is the **patient predator of a corrupted world**.

They do not charge into battle seeking glory. They do not wrap themselves in corruption seeking power. They read the signs—spoor, broken grass, feather, scat, oil, and the subtle tells of Blight that mark a creature's passage. They identify the highest-priority threat, mark it for death, and deliver precision damage from the safety of the back row.

Their power scales with their enemy's corruption. The more Blighted the target, the more devastating the Veiðimaðr's attacks become. Exploit Corruption provides up to +40% crit chance against heavily corrupted foes. Heartseeker Shot purges corruption from the target, converting their Blight into bonus damage.

This creates a unique niche: the **Blight-specialist** who excels precisely where others struggle. When the party faces grievously corrupted enemies—the unstable, glitching horrors that shrug off conventional attacks—the Veiðimaðr steps forward and delivers the shot that ends the threat.

But this is not sport. This is corridor maintenance.

The Veiðimaðr understands that in the Age of Echoes, indiscriminate hunting collapses routes. Waste invites famine and rumor. They take only what preserves corridor herds and scavenger balances. They record wind, shot, dress site, taint signs, and ash marks. Reproducibility and predictability keep roads open.

*Patience before motion.*

*Preparation before contact.*

*One arrow where others would spend a storm.*
