# The Forlorn — Psychic Echoes of the Einherjar

> *"A Forlorn is not a creature, not a spirit, and not a machine. It is the psychic scar tissue of the apocalypse. It is the raw, traumatic, and endlessly repeating echo of a mind's final, violent moment of dissolution."*
> — Scriptorium-Primus, Department of Ontological Trauma

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Classification** | Psychic Anomaly / Living Glitch |
| **Threat Type** | Type Gamma Psychic Hazard |
| **Physical Form** | Non-corporeal (crackling static effigy) |
| **Primary Habitat** | Jötun-Forged cockpits; ruins with Silver Cord infrastructure |
| **Sentience** | None (psychic recording in permanent loop) |

The Forlorn are not ghosts. They are not spirits. They are not enemies in any traditional sense.

They are **living glitches in reality**—fragments of the All-Rune's paradoxical anti-logic made manifest. They are the psychic death-screams of the Einherjar pilots, imprinted onto the Aether at the moment of the Ginnungagap Glitch and looping forever in the places where they died.

To encounter a Forlorn is not to face an enemy.

It is to have your mind directly exposed to the pure, maddening paradox that broke the world.

> [!DANGER]
> **TYPE GAMMA PSYCHIC HAZARD.** Forlorn do not attack the body. They attack the mind's ability to process logical reality. Proximity inflicts massive, unavoidable Psychic Stress. Prolonged exposure leads to Cognitive Paradox Syndrome and permanent mental collapse.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Einherjar

### Who They Were

To understand the Forlorn, you must first understand who they were before they became screaming echoes.

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Designation** | Einherjar ("Those Who Fight Alone") |
| **Role** | Elite pilot corps of the Jötun-Forged |
| **Selection Criteria** | Flawless logical reasoning, lightning reflexes, immense psychological resilience |
| **Social Status** | Celebrity heroes of the Age of Forging; masters of the god-machines |
| **Interface** | Silver Cord (Argentum-Nexus) neural link |

The Einherjar were the best and brightest of the Aesir and Vanir. They were hyper-logical minds, trained in **absolute mathematical certainty**, capable of merging their consciousness with machines the size of mountains and controlling them through pure thought.

They were the most stable, most rational, most psychologically fortified minds their civilization had ever produced.

And that is why they broke so completely.

### The Silver Cord

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Designation** | Argentum-Nexus / Silver Cord |
| **Function** | Psycho-spiritual neural interface |
| **Mechanism** | Direct merge of pilot consciousness with Jötun-Forged logic engine |
| **Connection** | Real-time link to the Aetheric network |

The Silver Cord allowed instantaneous, thought-based control of colossal machinery. It was the pinnacle of Aesir neuroengineering.

It was also the conduit through which the Ginnungagap Glitch reached directly into every connected pilot's mind.

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Birth of the Forlorn

### What Happened

At H-Hour of the Ginnungagap Glitch—the catastrophic "divide-by-zero" event in reality's source code triggered by the All-Rune—every Einherjar connected via Silver Cord experienced the following:

| Phase | Duration | Effect |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Initial Contact** | ~2 picoseconds | Pure anti-logic floods Silver Cord |
| **Cognitive Assault** | Instantaneous | Paradoxical data overwrites logical processes |
| **Dissolution** | Instantaneous | Consciousness "un-written from the inside out" |
| **Imprint** | Permanent | Final moment burned into local Aether |

Their minds—trained in absolute logic—were exposed to **pure, perfect anti-logic**.

The result was not death.

It was worse than death.

### The Psychic Back-Blast

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Mechanism** | Violent dissolution + immense Silver Cord power |
| **Result** | "Psychic back-blast" |
| **Data Imprinted** | Sensory input, pain, confusion, terror of final moment |
| **Anchor Point** | Physical location of death (cockpit) |
| **Duration** | Permanent |

The raw, traumatic data of each pilot's final moment—the blinding flash, the screech of tearing reality, the overwhelming wave of paradoxical data, the frantic failed attempt to disconnect, the deafening dissolution into static—was **permanently and violently imprinted onto the Aether**.

The Einherjar died.

The Forlorn was born.

## Nature and Existence: The Trauma Loop

### What a Forlorn Is

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Sentience** | None |
| **Awareness** | None |
| **Perception** | None (does not perceive modern world) |
| **Nature** | Psychic recording in permanent loop |
| **Duration** | Eternal (700+ years and counting) |

A Forlorn is not sentient. It does not think. It does not perceive. It does not react to the modern world.

It is a **psychic recording stuck in a permanent, horrifying loop**.

It is a wound in reality that endlessly bleeds the memory of its own creation.

### The Loop

Every Forlorn endlessly relives the same sequence:

| Phase | Sensory Content |
|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | The blinding flash of the Glitch |
| 2 | The screech of tearing reality |
| 3 | The overwhelming wave of paradoxical data from the machine |
| 4 | The frantic, failed attempt to disconnect |
| 5 | The final, deafening dissolution into static |
| **REPEAT** | *Forever* |

An explorer standing before a Forlorn is invisible. Unheard. Unnoticed.

The Forlorn does not see them.

The Forlorn sees only what it saw 700 years ago, in the final picosecond before it stopped being a person.

## Physical Manifestation

### Appearance

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Form** | Glitching, human-shaped effigy |
| **Composition** | Crackling static and pale, shifting light |
| **Position** | Often frozen in command throne posture |
| **Stability** | Flickering; reality distortion in immediate vicinity |
| **Movement** | Minimal; anchored to death location |

A Forlorn appears as a vaguely humanoid shape made of visual noise—a three-dimensional silhouette of crackling static, pale light, and fragments of frozen imagery. Some are frozen in the posture of their command thrones, hands still reaching for controls that no longer exist.

The air around them **shimmers and tears**, as if reality itself is struggling to process their presence.

### The Scream

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Type** | Type Gamma Psychic Broadcast |
| **Range** | Varies (meters to hundreds of meters) |
| **Frequency** | High-frequency, high-amplitude, piercing |
| **Content** | Raw paradoxical data; final moment trauma |
| **Perception** | Not heard with ears; felt in the mind |

A Forlorn does not make sound in any conventional sense.

But every sentient being within range **hears** it.

It is a scream that exists only in the mind—a piercing, high-frequency shriek of pure wrongness. It is the sound of a mind breaking. The sound of logic failing. The sound of the Blight's anti-logic trying to overwrite your perception of reality.

---

## Hazard Assessment: The Weight of Knowing

### Psychic Stress Mechanics

| Exposure Level | Effect |
|----------------|--------|
| **Distant Presence** | Unease; vague sense of wrongness |
| **Proximity** | Psychic Stress accumulation begins |
| **Close Range** | Rapid Psychic Stress; sensory intrusions |
| **Direct Exposure** | Massive Psychic Stress per turn; Memory-Mirror Effect |
| **Prolonged Exposure** | Cognitive Paradox Syndrome; mental collapse |

To draw near a Forlorn is to have your own mind begin to **resonate with its loop**.

### The Memory-Mirror Effect

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Mechanism** | Forlorn trauma subconsciously accesses observer's mind |
| **Effect** | Reflects observer's deepest fears, traumas, anxieties |
| **Result** | Observer's internal psychological defenses weaponized against them |
| **Severity** | Varies by individual; deeply personal |

The Forlorn's broadcast doesn't just inflict generic trauma.

It **finds your trauma**.

The Memory-Mirror Effect occurs when a Forlorn's psychic scream subconsciously accesses an observer's mind and reflects their **deepest-seated fears, past traumas, and buried anxieties** back at them. The observer's own psychological history becomes a weapon against them.

### Sensory Intrusions

Victims of Forlorn proximity experience involuntary sensory bleeds:

| Symptom | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Visual** | Flashes of a battle that ended centuries ago |
| **Kinesthetic** | Phantom jolt of a mech's death throes |
| **Auditory** | Dying pilot's screams in own thoughts |
| **Cognitive** | Fragments of paradoxical logic intruding on reasoning |
| **Emotional** | Overwhelming terror, confusion, despair (not your own) |

---

## Cognitive Paradox Syndrome: The Breaking Point

### Progression

| Stage | Symptoms | Reversibility |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| **Stage 1** | Paranoia, sensory distortion, intrusive thoughts | Fully reversible with rest |
| **Stage 2** | Hallucinations, difficulty distinguishing memory from reality | Reversible with intervention |
| **Stage 3** | Persistent delusions, identity fragmentation | Partially reversible |
| **Stage 4** | Complete cognitive collapse; "Static-Sickness" | **Irreversible** |

Prolonged exposure to a Forlorn leads to Cognitive Paradox Syndrome (CPS)—a progressive breakdown of the mind's ability to process logical reality.

The final stage is known colloquially as **"Static-Sickness"**: a state in which the victim's mind has been so thoroughly overwritten by paradoxical data that they can no longer function as a sentient being.

They become, in a sense, a living Forlorn themselves—trapped in their own loop of broken thoughts.

## Forlorn Convergence Points: Nexus of Sorrow

### Definition

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Classification** | Extreme Hazard Zone |
| **Cause** | Multiple Forlorn in close proximity |
| **Effect** | Overlapping psychic echoes merge |
| **Result** | "Symphony of Madness" |

In locations where multiple Einherjar died in close proximity—such as the cockpit bays of carrier vessels, command centers, or the sites of major battles—multiple Forlorn may occupy the same space.

Their psychic echoes **merge**, creating a profoundly complex, multi-layered cacophony of overlapping traumas.

### Hazard Amplification

| Standard Forlorn | Convergence Point |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Single trauma loop | Multiple overlapping trauma loops |
| One set of Memory-Mirror triggers | Multiple conflicting Memory-Mirror triggers |
| Survivable with preparation | Lethal to all but the most protected minds |
| Studied by Jötun-Readers | Avoided by everyone |

A Nexus of Sorrow threatens to trigger **multiple stages of Cognitive Paradox Syndrome simultaneously**.

> *"We do not send expeditions to Convergence Points to learn. We send them to confirm that some sorrows should remain unwitnessed."*
> — Master Archivist Åse, Scriptorium-Primus

## Combat Statistics (Mechanical)

### Core Stats

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Threat Tier** | Elite / Boss (depends on Forlorn type) |
| **HP** | N/A (non-corporeal) |
| **Physical Form** | None (cannot be targeted by physical attacks) |
| **Damage Output** | Psychic Stress per turn (passive) |

### Resistances & Immunities

| Type | Level |
|------|-------|
| **Physical Damage** | **Immune** |
| **Energy Damage** | **Immune** (most types) |
| **Psychic Damage** | Vulnerable (only damage type that affects them) |
| **[Fear]** | Immune |
| **[Poisoned]** | Immune |
| **[Bleeding]** | Immune |
| **All Status Effects** | Immune (non-corporeal) |

### Vulnerabilities

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Psychic Attacks** | Only way to "damage" a Forlorn |
| **Mind-Targeting Abilities** | Echo-Caller's Psychic Lash, etc. |
| **Aetheric Disruption** | Certain specialized runic countermeasures |

### Combat Behavior

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Aggression** | None (does not perceive enemies) |
| **Targeting** | None (broadcasts to all in range) |
| **Tactics** | None (not sentient) |
| **Movement** | Minimal; anchored to death location |

A Forlorn does not **fight**.

It simply **exists**, inflicting massive amounts of Psychic Stress on all characters each turn within its broadcast radius. It cannot be killed in any conventional sense—only disrupted, suppressed, or endured.

---

## Forlorn as Environmental Hazards

### Why Forlorn Are Different

| Standard Enemy | Forlorn |
|----------------|---------|
| Has HP to deplete | Cannot be "killed" conventionally |
| Makes attack decisions | Does not perceive combatants |
| Can be outmaneuvered | Broadcasts in all directions |
| Defeated = threat neutralized | Disrupted = temporarily suppressed |

Forlorn are best understood not as enemies to be fought, but as **environmental hazards** to be navigated, endured, or (rarely) studied.

### Tactical Considerations

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **Broadcast Radius** | Know the range; stay outside it if possible |
| **Line of Effect** | Some barriers reduce Psychic Stress |
| **Duration** | Minimize exposure time |
| **Preparation** | Psychic resistance gear; Coolant-Slime Salve |
| **Specialists** | Seiðkona, Echo-Callers have relevant abilities |

## Factional Perspectives

### Jötun-Readers: The Living Record

| Perspective | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Classification** | Priceless historical artifact; ultimate primary source |
| **Interest** | First-person sensory account of the Ginnungagap Glitch |
| **Risk** | Many brilliant minds lost in failed study attempts |
| **Method** | Specialized psychic shielding; extremely limited exposure |

> *"A Forlorn is the ultimate historical record: a living, first-person, sensory account of the exact moment of the Ginnungagap Glitch. To a historian, it is a priceless artifact. The danger, of course, is that reading this record may cost you your mind."*

### Iron-Banes: The Static-Curse

| Perspective | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Classification** | The ultimate manifestation of the ancestors' sin |
| **Theological Status** | Cursed spirits; proof of the Machine-Sin's horror |
| **Doctrine** | Cannot be fought with axe or spear; avoidance is wisdom |
| **Ritual** | Purification rites for those who survive exposure |

> *"The Static-Curse cannot be struck down by blade or fire. It is not a body to be destroyed, but a poison in the very air of a place. The Iron-Banes were right: some sins cannot be undone. They can only be endured."*

### God-Sleepers: The Holy Martyrs

| Perspective | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Classification** | Sacred spirits; Weeping Angels of the God-Folk |
| **Theological Status** | Divine martyrs in eternal mourning |
| **Doctrine** | Sites of Forlorn presence are sacred spaces |
| **Practice** | Will not enter; deep religious respect |

> *"They are the Weeping Angels, the Holy Martyrs of the sleeping gods. Their endless sorrow is a testament to the divine tragedy of the God-Fall. We do not disturb their sacred grief. We mourn with them, from a distance."*

### Scavenger Barons: The Haunted Zones

| Perspective | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Classification** | Extreme occupational hazard |
| **Risk Assessment** | Most valuable ruins = most haunted |
| **Terminology** | "Static-Sickness" for CPS |
| **Economics** | High-value salvage behind Forlorn = premium danger pay |

> *"Every scav knows the rule: the richer the ruin, the worse the ghosts. The Forlorn guard the best salvage, and they don't even know they're doing it. You want what's behind them? Better hope your mind is stronger than theirs was."*

### Seiðkona & Echo-Callers: The Communion

| Perspective | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Classification** | Source of lore; subject of specialized abilities |
| **Unique Capability** | Can interface with Forlorn (at extreme risk) |
| **Ability** | Forlorn Communion (heretical; high Psychic Stress cost) |
| **Goal** | Extract historical data from the trauma loop |

> *"We do not fight the Forlorn. We listen to them. In their endless scream is the truth of what happened—the first-person testimony of the Glitch itself. To hear it without breaking is the Seiðkona's greatest test. Most fail."*

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"The weeping ghosts of the God-Folk, spirits of sorrow trapped in the hulks of their giant steeds. They do not see the living. They see only the moment of their ending, forever and forever, a scream that never stops screaming. To approach them is to hear that scream yourself. To linger is to join them in their eternal mourning."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"Psychic scar tissue of the Ginnungagap Glitch. Non-sentient trauma loops anchored to Silver Cord termination points. Type Gamma broadcast inflicts progressive Cognitive Paradox Syndrome via Memory-Mirror resonance. No physical form; immune to conventional damage. Vulnerable only to psychic-spectrum attacks. Presence renders high-value ruins effectively inaccessible to non-specialized personnel."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"HAZARD CLASSIFICATION: Type Gamma Psychic Anomaly. ORIGIN: Einherjar Cognitive Catastrophe (ECC), H-Hour +2ps. MECHANISM: Silver Cord back-blast imprinting consciousness dissolution onto local Aether. THREAT MODEL: Passive area denial via cumulative Psychic Stress. DAMAGE TYPE: Psychic (unavoidable within broadcast radius). COUNTERMEASURES: Distance, exposure time limits, psychic resistance augmentation, specialized Seiðkona intervention."*

## Summary

The Forlorn are not enemies.

They are memorials.

They are the Einherjar—the best, brightest, most psychologically resilient minds of the Age of Forging—frozen forever in the moment of their greatest failure. They were hyper-logical pilots trained in absolute mathematical certainty, and in the space of a picosecond, they were exposed to pure, perfect anti-logic.

Their minds did not simply break.

They were **un-written from the inside out**.

And as they dissolved, the immense power of the Silver Cord neural interface captured that dissolution—the sensory input, the pain, the confusion, the terror—and burned it permanently into the Aether.

Now they loop.

Forever.

The blinding flash. The screech of tearing reality. The wave of paradoxical data. The frantic attempt to disconnect. The dissolution into static.

**Repeat.**

They do not perceive the modern world. An explorer standing before a Forlorn is invisible, unheard, unnoticed. The Forlorn sees only what it saw 700 years ago. It is trapped in its final moment, broadcasting that moment into the minds of anyone foolish enough to approach.

To draw near a Forlorn is to begin resonating with its loop.

You start to see flashes of a battle that ended centuries ago. You feel the phantom jolt of a machine's death throes. You hear a pilot's screams in your own thoughts. And worst of all—through the Memory-Mirror Effect—the Forlorn finds your own deepest fears and reflects them back at you, turning your own psychology into a weapon against you.

Prolonged exposure leads to Cognitive Paradox Syndrome. Your mind loses its ability to process logical reality. You begin to hallucinate. You lose the ability to distinguish memory from perception. And eventually, if you don't escape, your mind simply **stops functioning**.

They call it Static-Sickness.

It is, in a sense, becoming a Forlorn yourself.

The Jötun-Readers see them as priceless historical artifacts—living first-person accounts of the Glitch itself. The Iron-Banes call them the Static-Curse, proof of the ancestors' unforgivable sin. The God-Sleepers venerate them as Holy Martyrs, their endless sorrow a sacred testament to divine tragedy.

The scavengers simply know the rule: **the richer the ruin, the worse the ghosts**.

The Forlorn guard the best salvage in Aethelgard, and they don't even know they're doing it. They are not protecting anything. They are not aware of anything. They are simply **screaming**, forever, into the minds of anyone who comes too close.

They are not monsters.

They are monuments to the moment the world broke.

And in the broken places of Aethelgard, they scream still.

**Forever.**
