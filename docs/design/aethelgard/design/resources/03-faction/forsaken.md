# The Forsaken — Ice-Thralls of Niflheim

> *"The ledger is not a path to freedom. No one ever has paid it off."*
> — The Ice-Thrall's Primer

---

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Classification** | Indentured Labor Population |
| **Common Names** | Ice-Thralls, The Creedless, Children of the Rusted Chain |
| **Core Philosophy** | The Creed of the Cold: Survival Above All Else |
| **Primary Territory** | Niflheim Deck (Deck 06); Dreadnought Holds |
| **Leadership Structure** | None (Subject to Scavenger Baron kleptocracy) |
| **Relationship to Blight** | Pragmatic endurance; CPS dismissed as "Ice-Madness" |

The Skalds of the south have no songs for the Forsaken.

They are a people without a Hold to sing of, without a Jarl to praise. They are the nameless, faceless masses of the frozen north, the hands that dig the ice and the bodies that feed the wolves. Their name is a curse, given to them by outsiders, and it is a name they have grimly and accurately embraced.

The Forsaken are not a faction in the traditional sense—they are the human engine of Niflheim's brutal kleptocracy, a people whose entire existence is a tragic case study in the societal consequences of resource monopoly and environmental hostility.

They are the baseline of human suffering and resilience in this age.

## Core Identity: The Creed of the Cold

### The Foundational Philosophy

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Survival Above All** | Grand ideologies are luxuries for the warm; pragmatic endurance is the only truth |
| **The Ice-Debt** | Life itself is borrowed from the Baron who controls the fire |
| **No Hope, Only Endurance** | The language itself contains no aspirational vocabulary |
| **Solidarity in Chains** | Rope-brothers and debt-kin are the only wealth Ice-Thralls possess |

The Forsaken have no time for the grand, philosophical debates of the great Creeds. Their culture is a stripped-down, brutally pragmatic creed of pure survival.

> *"We have watched the Iron-Banes preach liberation while their crusades fail catastrophically. We have watched the God-Sleepers promise divine awakening while we freeze. We have watched the Jötun-Readers document our suffering with scholarly precision while doing nothing to stop it. All grand narratives lead to disappointment. Better to focus on surviving today than dreaming of tomorrow."*

### What the Forsaken Know

| Other Factions Say | The Forsaken Know |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| "You'll be free someday" | "The ledger never shrinks" |
| "Things will improve" | "Chain-years only accumulate" |
| "Hope sustains the spirit" | "Hope is a luxury that kills" |
| "Fight for your freedom" | "Rebellion means Long Walk. Long Walk means death." |

## Origins: The Rusted Chain

### The Great Northern Gamble

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Genesis Period** | Age of Walls (Early centuries, ~100-300 PG) |
| **Origin Populations** | Failed Kings, exiles, bankrupts from every corner of Aethelgard |
| **Catalyst** | The "suicidal gold rush" to Niflheim seeking Valhalla Contingency riches |
| **Outcome** | Mass indenture to those who controlled the only source of warmth |

The ancestors of the Forsaken were not a single people. They were the desperate, the greedy, and the exiled:

| Origin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Failed Kings** | Scavengers who dreamed of becoming Barons but lacked strength to seize a Dreadnought |
| **Ruined Farmers** | Midgardians whose lands were lost to Svin-fylking stampedes or blight |
| **Apostate Banes** | Iron-Banes cast out for showing a moment's weakness |
| **Disgraced Dvergr** | Guild members exiled for contract violations |
| **Bankrupt Rust-Clans** | Scavengers whose Rigs were destroyed in Rig-Wars |

They came to Niflheim seeking a fortune.

They found only the absolute, world-killing cold.

### The Founding Oath

Faced with a simple, brutal choice—freeze to death alone in the dark, or bend the knee and serve the Baron who controlled the warmth of a Dreadnought's geothermal heart—they chose to live.

The first oath of fealty was sworn not on a holy relic but on a greasy, humming engine block. It was the first link forged in the Rusted Chain of the Forsaken.

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **The Oath** | Exchange of freedom for proximity to warmth |
| **The Bargain** | A quick death in the cold traded for a slow death in servitude |
| **The Inheritance** | Debt passes to children; chains grow heavier each generation |
| **The Result** | 400+ years of perpetual bondage |

---

## Society and Structure: The Dreadnought Hold

### Life Under the Baron

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Living Quarters** | Crowded holds maintaining -5°C to -10°C despite geothermal proximity |
| **Personal Space** | 0.8m × 2m bunk area containing all possessions |
| **Privacy** | None |
| **Noise** | Constant track grinding, engine rumble, crew activity |
| **Rations** | 800g nutrient paste daily, 2L recycled water (often rust-tainted) |

The vast majority of the Forsaken live and die within the crowded, noisy, and freezing "Hold" section of a Baron's Dreadnought. Their lives are a monotonous, grinding cycle of perilous labor and brief, huddled rest.

### The Hierarchy of the Hold

| Rank | Description | Casualty Rate |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Green-fingers** | Newest arrivals (0-6 months); assigned most dangerous tasks | 30-40% in first 6 months |
| **Salvage-hands** | Backbone of operations (6 months-5 years); thermal lance operators, vault breach specialists | 8-15% annually |
| **Rust-hands** | Elite salvagers (5+ years); encyclopedic knowledge, higher shares | 5-10% annually |
| **Rig-jockeys** | Engineers and mechanics; critical importance grants privileges | Execution for failure |
| **Baron's Fist** | Elite guard; enforcers of Baron's authority | Variable |

### The Cog-Grind

| Work Cycle | Activity |
|------------|----------|
| **0600-0800** | Morning rations, gear checks, thermal cycle preparation |
| **0800-1200** | First salvage shift (vault breach, material extraction) |
| **1200-1300** | Midday rations (often skipped) |
| **1300-1800** | Second salvage shift (continued extraction, transport) |
| **1800-2000** | Evening rations, gear cleaning, injury treatment |
| **2000-0600** | Sleep (frequently interrupted) |

Their work is the single most dangerous job in the world. They dig for weeks into glaciers with thermal lances, battle Cryo-Vörðr drones guarding vault entrances, and fend off Hoarfrost Wolves drawn by the heat of their work.

They are the expendable front line in the war for the past.

## The Ice-Debt: A Coin of Sweat and Blood

### The System of Perpetual Servitude

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Principal Debt** | 500-800 Pure Steel equivalent for initial integration |
| **Standard Terms** | 8-15 years base service |
| **Interest Structure** | 0% formal interest, but accumulation ensures debt grows faster than repayment |
| **Inheritance** | Children born aboard automatically inherit parental debt proportionally |
| **Release Conditions** | Debt clearance (statistically impossible), King's Find, Baron's favor, external purchase, or death |

### The Mathematics of Inescapability

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Daily provision costs** | 0.85 PS per person average |
| **Daily salvage earnings** | 0.48 PS per person average (including failed runs) |
| **Net daily accumulation** | +0.37 PS debt per person |
| **Monthly debt growth** | +11.1 PS |
| **Medical emergencies** | +60-210 PS per incident (16% of crew annually) |
| **Gear losses** | +85-450 PS per incident (22% of crew annually) |
| **Child births** | +220-380 PS integration debt per child |

> *"The math doesn't work. I started with 1,440 PS debt. Sixteen years later: 4,285 PS. My family extracted probably 30,000 PS value through labor. Baron made 20,000+ PS profit before selling us for 4,200 PS. But what choice? The three survivors who chose Midgard trek over Ice-Debt? Dead within 18 days, frozen on glacier. We're alive. Enslaved, but alive."*
> — Erik Frostborn, 16.4 chain-years service

### The Cog-Master's Ledger

Every Baron employs a "Cog-Master"—a cruel but meticulous quartermaster who keeps the ledger. Every ration, every piece of gear, every drop of medicine is added to a Forsaken's debt.

| Calculation Type | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| **Provision accounting** | Every resource consumed recorded as debt increase |
| **Credit calculation** | Salvage shares credited (typically 2-5% of value) |
| **Punishment tracking** | Failed quotas, gear losses, rule violations added as penalties |
| **Generational projection** | Multi-generational debt calculated decades in advance |

The system is designed to be inescapable. The shares are small, the cost of living is high, and a single mistake can plunge a Forsaken so deep into debt that it would take a lifetime to break even.

To a Forsaken, freedom is not a right; it is a number on a ledger they can never hope to reach.

---

## Baron Justice: The Long Walk

### Crime and Punishment

| Violation Type | Punishment | Debt Impact |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Minor infractions** | Reduced rations (20-40% for 3-7 days), dangerous work details | +5-20 PS |
| **Quota failures** | Extended work cycles (10-14 hours), hazardous assignments | +40-120 PS |
| **Major violations** | The Long Walk, flogging (10-50 lashes), maiming, execution | +200-600 PS |

### The Long Walk

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Duration** | 8-16 hours depending on violation severity |
| **Gear** | Thermal underlayer only (-10°C to -15°C protection), single heat-pack (4-6 hour duration) |
| **Exile Distance** | 1.5-2.5 km from Dreadnought |
| **Survival Probability** | 40-70% depending on conditions and offender's value |

The "Long Walk" represents Baron justice at its most calculated—punishment designed to maximize deterrent effect while preserving workforce value. Convicted individuals are expelled from the Dreadnought for a fixed duration with minimal survival gear, forced to survive Niflheim's exposure while remaining within sight of warmth they cannot access.

### The Final Cog

When Barons determine workforce value cannot justify continued employment, they invoke "Paying the Final Cog"—debt marked as settled through death.

| Execution Method | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Exposure execution** | Permanent exile with zero survival gear; death within 4-12 hours |
| **Drop execution** | Thrown from Dreadnought deck into crevasse; instant death |
| **Combat execution** | Sent alone against Hrimthursar or Hoarfrost Wolf pack |

Baron pronounces: *"Your debt is paid. The ice accepts your final offering."*

Frequency: 8-15 executions annually across all Baron territories (~0.1% of Forsaken population).

## The King's Find: The Myth of Freedom

### The Legend

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Definition** | A single, priceless artifact whose value would clear all Ice-Debt |
| **Statistical Probability** | 0.001% per Forsaken per year (~1 in 100,000 Forsaken-years) |
| **Documented Instances** | 9 confirmed cases in 83 years (700-783 PG) |
| **Baron Honor Rate** | 55% honored, 45% eliminated discoverer |

The one, single hope that keeps the entire brutal system from collapsing is the legend of the "King's Find." This is the dream of a single, priceless artifact—a treasure of such immense value that a Forsaken's share would be enough to wipe out their Ice-Debt and buy their freedom.

| Legendary Finds | Value |
|-----------------|-------|
| **Intact Einherjar consciousness** | 127,000 PS |
| **Uncorrupted Valhalla weapons cache** | 90,000 PS |
| **Pre-Glitch power core** | 140,000 PS |

### The Cruel Truth

| Reality | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Lifetime Probability** | 0.015% for 15-year career salvager |
| **Baron Response** | 45% stage "accidents" to eliminate discoverers and claim full value |
| **Psychological Function** | Maintains hope despite mathematical impossibility |
| **System Effect** | 94% of Forsaken believe King's Find possible despite 0.001% probability |

> *"But Volkir did it. Someone has to be next. Why not me?"*
> — Common Forsaken response when confronted with statistics

The grim, unspoken truth: no Baron would ever honor a King's Find from a valuable worker. A Forsaken who found such a prize would not be freed—they would be a liability, a loose end to be quietly disposed of in the next "accidental" ice-fall.

The dream of freedom is the most valuable and most brutally enforced shackle of them all.

## Fimbul-Cant: The Language of Ice and Debt

### The Language of Survival

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Type** | Pidgin/Creole (~400+ years development) |
| **Native Speakers** | 12,000-18,000 (80-90% of Forsaken population) |
| **Core Vocabulary** | ~1,800 terms across three domains |
| **Function** | Psychological architecture encoding brutal existence |

Fimbul-Cant is a "lean, hard dialect devoid of pretense and focused purely on utility." It contains no aspirational vocabulary, no future-tense constructions for non-Dreadnought life. To speak of freedom is to speak of "free-cold" (death) or "coin-tongue" (exploitation).

### Core Lexicon

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Ice-Debt** | Indentured servitude contract (frost-obligation) |
| **Chain-year** | Single year of Ice-Debt service |
| **Debt-marks** | Physical tattoos tracking service duration and debt |
| **Cog-Grind** | Relentless daily salvage labor cycle |
| **King's Find** | Legendary artifact enabling debt clearance |
| **Rig-father/Rig-mother** | Baron holding Ice-Debt contract |
| **The Long Walk** | Exile punishment by exposure |
| **Paying the Final Cog** | Death settling debt |
| **Free-cold** | Independent survival outside Baron control (suicide) |
| **Green-fingers** | Inexperienced salvager (<6 months service) |
| **Rust-hand** | Elite salvager (5+ years service) |
| **Rope-brother** | Trusted crew member for whiteout navigation |
| **Warm-share** | Redistributing heat resources during emergencies |
| **Debt-kin** | Multi-generational families born into service |
| **Coin-tongue** | Outsider attempting to negotiate Ice-Debt purchase |
| **Ghost-warm** | Dangerous false warmth during hypothermia onset |
| **Ice-teeth** | Frostbite (5-stage severity classification) |
| **Scrap-nose** | Ability to identify valuable salvage by smell/texture |
| **Vault-debt** | Salvage quota assigned per shift |

### Psychological Function

| Element | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Precision as survival** | Exact terminology prevents fatal miscommunication |
| **Hope as pathology** | No vocabulary for aspiration; hope treated as dangerous |
| **Collective endurance** | Solidarity terms enable psychological survival |

> *"This is our language of survival. Respect it or leave it alone."*

---

## Culture: The Gutter-Sagas

### A Culture of Scars

| Value | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| **Toughness** | Physical scars as marks of experience |
| **Luck** | Survival attributed to fortune, not skill |
| **Utility** | Only practical competence matters |
| **Solidarity** | Rope-brothers valued above all else |

The Forsaken are a people defined by their scars, both physical and mental. Frostbite is a mark of experience. A wound from a security drone is a badge of honor. Their sagas are not of gods and heroes, but of legendary scavengers who survived a vault collapse or went face-to-face with a Hrimthursar and lived to tell the tale.

### The Gutter-Sagas

| Saga Type | Heroes |
|-----------|--------|
| **Survival Tales** | "One-Eyed Helga" who lost an eye to a Cryo-Vörðr but brought back a priceless power cell |
| **Long Walk Survivors** | Those who returned from the ice against all odds |
| **King's Find Legends** | Volkir Steelhand, Hrafna Ironside, Thorsten Cold-Heart |
| **Engineering Feats** | Rig-jockeys who kept dying engines running |

They have no time for the grand myths of the gods. Their Skalds sing "Gutter-Sagas"—short, brutal, and often darkly humorous tales of survival and failure.

### The Game of Knuckles

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Equipment** | Sharpened metallic knuckle-bones of ice-creatures |
| **Nature** | Brutal gambling game of chance and pain |
| **Outcome** | Often ends in bloody brawl |
| **Purpose** | One of the few releases for pent-up desperation |

### Debt-Marks

Forsaken develop elaborate tattoo systems documenting Ice-Debt history:

| Mark Type | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Service stripes** | One stripe per chain-year served (forearm) |
| **Cog symbols** | Major incidents (medical emergencies, Long Walk survival) |
| **Chain links** | Children born into debt |
| **Frost patterns** | Frostbite injuries requiring amputation |
| **Ledger glyphs** | Current debt tier (encoded runic shorthand) |

---

## Environmental Challenges: Life in Niflheim

### The Frozen Tomb

| Hazard | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Ambient Temperature** | -18°C to -35°C baseline |
| **Whiteout Events** | 2-10 per 8-hour window; <5m visibility |
| **Hoarfrost Wolves** | Apex predators with Embrittling Breath |
| **Cryo-Vörðr Drones** | Pre-Glitch security automata guarding vaults |
| **Hrimthursar** | Colossal ice-dwelling constructs |
| **Slumbering Echoes** | CPS from Valhalla Vault-07 psychic contamination |

### Survival Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Independent survival mortality** | 60%+ in first year |
| **Death from exposure** | Within 8-12 hours typical conditions; 2-4 hours during Ice-Surge |
| **Average life expectancy** | 45-55 years (vs. 60-70 for Combine, 80-90 for Dvergr) |
| **Primary causes of death** | Salvage accidents (40%), exposure (25%), violence (20%), disease (15%) |

### CPS and "Ice-Madness"

| Stage | Symptoms |
|-------|----------|
| **Baseline** | Persistent unease, auditory hallucinations (6-12 hr tolerance) |
| **Stage-3** | Intrusive Einherjar knowledge, personality fragmentation (72+ hr) |
| **Stage-4** | Complete consciousness overwrite, Forlorn transformation (120+ hr) |

The Forsaken suffer immensely from the constant psychic torment of Niflheim—the Slumbering Echoes from Valhalla Vault-07. The resulting Cognitive Paradox Syndrome is dismissed by the Barons as "Ice-Madness," a sign of weakness to be culled from the workforce.

## Factional Relations

### The Scavenger Barons: Masters and Owners

| Baron View | Forsaken View |
|------------|---------------|
| "Valuable labor assets bound by legitimate contract." | "Cruel masters who own our lives and our children's lives." |
| "Ice-Debt is fair exchange for survival resources." | "The ledger is designed to be inescapable." |
| "Harsh but necessary governance in extreme environment." | "They profit from our suffering and call it mercy." |

The relationship is not partnership—it is ownership. The Forsaken are not citizens; they are the property of the Baron, their lives a commodity to be spent in the pursuit of salvage.

### The Dvergr Clans: Complicit Partners

| Dvergr View | Forsaken View |
|-------------|---------------|
| "Valuable trade partners; reliable salvage suppliers." | "They see us as Ice-Thralls—a resource, not a people." |
| "We maintain 'fair treatment' contract clauses." | "Their contracts fuel the system that enslaves us." |
| "Our presence moderates worst abuses." | "They profit from our chains while claiming neutrality." |

To the Dvergr and traders of the south, the Forsaken are largely invisible. They are the grim, silent figures who haul crates of salvage from the Dreadnoughts, their faces hidden by scarves and goggles. They are seen not as a people, but as another tool the Barons use to extract their wealth.

### The Iron-Bane Crusade: Failed Liberators

| Iron-Bane View | Forsaken View |
|----------------|---------------|
| "Slaves to be liberated from tech-heretic masters." | "Crusaders whose interventions fail catastrophically." |
| "The Ice-Debt is sin made system." | "Their purity does not keep us warm." |
| "We offer sanctuary and freedom." | "77% of rescued Forsaken return to Dreadnoughts." |

The Iron-Banes attempted direct intervention twice (773 PG and 779 PG)—both catastrophic. Missionary teams killed within 18 hours. Mass debt-purchases resulted in 77% failure rate as rescued individuals returned to Dreadnoughts, unable to adapt to freedom.

### The God-Sleeper Cults: Dreamers of Awakening

| God-Sleeper View | Forsaken View |
|------------------|---------------|
| "Lost souls denied the comfort of faith." | "Their gods sleep while we freeze." |
| "When the gods wake, Ice-Debt becomes obsolete." | "We cannot eat promises of divine awakening." |
| "The Forsaken endure divine trial by ice." | "If this is trial, the gods are cruel." |

The God-Sleepers have published theoretical frameworks for "Niflheim Liberation"—mass infrastructure deploying 40 geothermal communes. Estimated cost: 2.8 million PS. Funding secured: 0 PS.

### The Jötun-Readers: Clinical Observers

| Jötun-Reader View | Forsaken View |
|-------------------|---------------|
| "Living case study in human adaptation limits." | "They document our suffering and do nothing." |
| "Our mandate requires observation without intervention." | "Scholarly neutrality toward ongoing atrocity." |
| "We preserve records for future generations." | "They write our epitaph while we're still alive." |

The Scriptorium views the Forsaken with clinical interest, but their observation is a source of profound ethical dilemma. To study the Forsaken is to passively witness an ongoing crime against humanity.

### The Rangers Guild: Professional Distance

| Ranger View | Forsaken View |
|-------------|---------------|
| "Attempted 23 humanitarian extractions; 17% success rate." | "Some try to help. Most maintain 'professional neutrality.'" |
| "Debt-purchase not scalable for 12,000+ population." | "They buy a few and call it conscience." |
| "We document abuses and bear witness." | "Witness is not rescue." |

Rangers attempted purchasing 8 Forsaken debts—37% Baron acceptance rate. Average cost: 2,400 PS per individual. Conclusion: not scalable.

## The Thrall (Player Specialization)

### Overview

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Archetype** | Survivor / Endurer |
| **Primary Attributes** | VIGOR / WILL |
| **Core Identity** | Hardened survivor of impossible conditions |
| **Special Feature** | Cold resistance, Ice-Debt escape, Fimbul-Cant fluency |
| **Trauma Risk** | High (generational suffering, institutional betrayal) |

The Thrall specialization represents someone who has survived (or escaped) the Ice-Debt system—carrying the scars, the language, and the brutal pragmatism forged in Niflheim's frozen holds.

### Key Abilities

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Cold Resistance** | Reduced damage from environmental cold hazards |
| **Endurance** | Extended survival without food, warmth, or rest |
| **Scrap-Nose** | Identify valuable salvage by smell/texture |
| **Rope-Brother Bond** | Enhanced teamwork with designated ally |
| **Creed of the Cold** | Resistance to psychological manipulation and false hope |
| **CPS Habituation** | Partial resistance to Slumbering Echoes (18-24 hr tolerance vs. 6-12 hr) |

---

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the frozen tomb where the Aesir hid their greatest treasures and their darkest secrets, the Forsaken make their home—not by choice, but by chains. They are the children of the Rusted Chain, bound by oaths their ancestors swore on greasy engine blocks when the alternative was freezing to death alone. They have no Creed to comfort them, no gods to pray to, no hope to sustain them—only the Ice-Debt, the Cog-Grind, and the slim, cruel dream of the King's Find. Their sagas are not of heroes but of survivors, sung in the Fimbul-Cant—that hard, lean language that has no word for freedom except 'free-cold,' which means death. They are the true people of Niflheim: not the Barons on their iron thrones, but the thousands who live and die in shadow of those thrones, their lives testament to a simple, brutal truth—in the coldest place in the world, the greatest treasure is one more day of warmth."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Forsaken represent post-Glitch humanity's most tragic adaptation to extreme environmental scarcity—a population of 12,000-18,000 individuals bound under inescapable Ice-Debt contracts to Scavenger Baron kleptocracy. The system operates as perfect exploitation engine: voluntary (populations choose servitude over death), mathematically inescapable (debt accumulation outpaces earning capacity), generationally self-perpetuating (children inherit parental debt), and psychologically self-reinforcing ('King's Find' mythology maintains hope despite 0.001% probability). Baron governance achieves absolute authority not through military power but through monopoly on warmth in environment where cold means death within hours. Average life expectancy: 45-55 years. Primary causes of death: salvage accidents (40%), exposure (25%), violence (20%), disease (15%). Strategic value to external factions: salvage extraction labor, rare material supply chain, cautionary example of post-collapse social devolution."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"POPULATION CLASSIFICATION: Forsaken (Niflheim Ice-Thralls). ORGANIZATIONAL TYPE: Indentured labor population under kleptocratic governance. PRIMARY FUNCTION: Salvage extraction for Scavenger Baron economy. SECONDARY FUNCTION: None (no independent agency). POPULATION: 12,000-18,000 across all Baron territories. TERRITORY: Dreadnought holds throughout Niflheim Deck. GOVERNANCE: Subject to Baron absolute authority; no internal political structure. RISK PROFILE: Low (to external observers); Extreme (to Forsaken themselves). STRATEGIC ASSETS: Salvage expertise, cold adaptation, CPS habituation (18-24 hr tolerance). STRATEGIC LIABILITIES: No military capacity, no political agency, generational trauma, chronic health issues, mathematical debt inescapability."*

## Summary

The Forsaken do not dream of a better world.

They dream of a warmer one.

They are a people whose entire history is written in the scars left by the cold and the lash. They are the ultimate proof that in the Age of Echoes, the most common currency is not the cog or the credit, but the debt.

And for the Forsaken, the debt is eternal.

Where the Rust-Clans found freedom in the industrial graveyards of Jötunheim, the Forsaken found only new chains. Where the Iron-Banes preach liberation, the Forsaken know that crusades fail and rescuers die. Where the God-Sleepers promise divine awakening, the Forsaken know that gods do not answer prayers offered in frozen holds.

They believe in nothing.

They hope for nothing.

They endure.

Their ancestors swore oaths on greasy engine blocks, trading freedom for warmth, and their children inherited those oaths along with the debt. Their grandchildren will do the same. The ledger never shrinks. The chain-years only accumulate. The Long Walk awaits those who resist, and the Final Cog awaits everyone eventually.

The surface world calls them Ice-Thralls.

The Barons call them assets.

The Dvergr call them resources.

The Creeds call them pitiable.

They call themselves something simpler.

**Forsaken.**

A name given by outsiders.

A name grimly and accurately embraced.

And in the coldest, darkest place in the world, the greatest treasure is one more day of warmth.

Even if that warmth belongs to someone else.

Even if the price is everything.

Even if the price is forever.
