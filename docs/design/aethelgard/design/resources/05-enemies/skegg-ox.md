# Skegg-ox — Feral Flumen-Purger Pattern Aquatic Sanitizer Specification

> *"The Skalds of the river-lands warn fishermen to fear the glint of metal in the water, for it may not be treasure. They tell of the Skegg-ox, the Blade-Pike, a fish whose smile is a row of rusted daggers. This is not a tale to scare children from the water's edge; it is a literal and vital warning. The Skegg-ox is a predator that has learned to forge its teeth from the bones of a dead civilization, and its bite is the kiss of a forgotten age."*
> — Lead Ecologist, Scriptorium-Primus, Division of Post-Glitch Ecology

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Pre-Glitch Designation** | Flumen-Purger Pattern Aquatic Sanitizer |
| **Common Names** | Blade-Pike, River-King Below, Rust-Jaw |
| **Creature Type** | Fauna (Feral Vanir Bio-Asset) |
| **Threat Tier** | Standard / Moderate Hazard |
| **Primary Habitat** | Midgard river-lands, scrap-choked pools, sunken transit wrecks |
| **Faction Alignment** | None (Feral Bio-Asset) |
| **Hazard Type** | Biological, Chemical, Ferrous, Physical/Environmental |

The Skegg-ox is not a monster. It is a janitor that learned to kill—and its terrible, elegant logic has **never, ever stopped adapting**.

> [!DANGER]
> **MODERATE HAZARD CLASSIFICATION.** Default doctrine is **NON-CONTACT** in scrap-heavy waterways. The Skegg-ox's bite does not cut cleanly—it tears and shreds with jagged, irregular metal shards, causing massive wounds that almost certainly lead to fatal **Blight-Tetanus** if untreated. The metal itself is the delivery system for centuries of bacterial accumulation and Blight-particulates.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Perfect Janitor

### Original Purpose

The Flumen-Purger Pattern Aquatic Sanitizer was a vital ecological maintenance tool for the Midgard Deck's pristine, engineered waterways.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Midgard Waterways** | Ecological maintenance and debris removal |
| **River Systems** | Prevention of algae blooms and organic buildup |
| **Engineered Channels** | Processing of inorganic waste and sunken debris |

These were not designed for predation. Their purpose was **absolute, systematic cleanliness of the aquatic environment**.

### The Living Garbage Disposal

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Body Plan** | Large, powerful bottom-feeder; heavily muscled |
| **Temperament** | Placid, non-aggressive |
| **Digestive System** | Incredibly robust; could process organic and small inorganic materials |
| **Jaw Mechanism** | Powerful grinding plates for debris breakdown |
| **Function** | Consuming sunken logs, algae blooms, and small inert waste |

Unlike predatory bio-assets, the Flumen-Purger was designed to be slow, methodical, and utterly essential—the unseen janitor keeping the rivers clean and clear.

### The Perfect World's Servant

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Environment** | Pristine, curated Midgard waterways |
| **Diet** | Organic debris, algae, small inorganics |
| **Behavior** | Passive; non-territorial |
| **Maintenance Role** | Continuous ecosystem cleaning without intervention |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Invisible Worker.** The Flumen-Purger was never meant to be seen or feared. It worked in the depths, grinding away the imperfections of a perfect world, keeping the rivers of paradise crystal clear. It was the janitor nobody noticed, doing the job nobody wanted.

---

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Iron Jaw

The Glitch turned the perfect janitor into the perfect ambush predator.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Powerful Jaw Musculature** | Fully functional; adapted for new purpose |
| **Robust Digestive System** | Operational; processes metal-laden prey |
| **Bottom-Dwelling Behavior** | Preserved; repurposed for ambush predation |
| **Territorial Instinct** | Emerged from environmental pressure |

### What Was Corrupted

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Natural Grinding Teeth** | Worn away by abrasive metal debris |
| **Placid Temperament** | Replaced by aggressive ambush behavior |
| **Diet Parameters** | Expanded to include living prey |
| **Habitat Requirements** | Inverted; now seeks scrap-heavy environments |

### The Souring

The "Civil War of Glitches" filled Midgard's clean rivers with a graveyard of twisted metal and shattered machines. For the Flumen-Purger, this was a catastrophic shift.

> **"The rivers are choked with the bones of a dead world. And something has learned to wear those bones as teeth."**

The Purger's instinct to consume debris remained, but its natural grinding teeth were not designed for shearing Adamant-Weave plating. Generations of abrasive diet caused teeth to wear away, break, and fail—creating intense evolutionary pressure.

### The Adaptation

The survivors developed a horrifying new adaptation: **intentionally lodging sharp, durable scrap metal shards into their powerful gums**.

The behavior was passed down through generations. The jawbone evolved to hold these artificial teeth. The scavenger had become an innovator.

| **Bite** | Metal shards tear and shred; massive tissue damage |
| **Retreat** | Returns to concealment with prey or awaits next opportunity |

### The Tearing Bite

> *"Its bite is devastating. The jagged, irregular metal shards do not cut cleanly but tear and shred, causing massive, ragged wounds that are almost impossible to stitch."*

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Wound Type** | Ragged, torn; multiple irregular lacerations |
| **Mechanism** | Irregular metal edges catch and rip rather than slice |
| **Severity** | Massive tissue damage; often disabling |
| **Secondary Threat** | Blight-Tetanus from bacterial/particulate load |
| **Mortality** | Untreated wounds almost certainly fatal |

---

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Moderate Hazard

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ambush Predation** | Near-invisible until strike; explosive attack from concealment |
| **Tearing Wounds** | Metal shards cause ragged, unstitchable lacerations |
| **Blight-Tetanus** | Rusted metal carries potent bacterial/Blight-particulate cocktail |
| **Infrastructure Damage** | Can tear through fishing nets; capsize small boats |
| **Territorial Defense** | Aggressively defends scrap-rich hunting grounds |

### Lethality Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Direct Strike Survival** | Moderate (survivable if treated immediately) |
| **Untreated Wound Survival** | Near-zero (Blight-Tetanus onset almost certain) |
| **Evasion Possibility** | Low once in territory (camouflage defeats awareness) |
| **Detection Effectiveness** | Moderate with sounding poles and glint-scanning |
| **Multi-Skegg-ox Territory** | Elevated (overlapping hunting grounds near large wrecks) |

### Blight-Tetanus Protocol

| Stage | Symptoms | Treatment |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Immediate** | Wound contamination; metal fragments embedded | Remove fragments; aggressive wound cleaning |
| **Hours 1–6** | Swelling; discoloration; fever onset | Antiseptic treatment; binding |
| **Hours 6–24** | Muscle stiffness; jaw lock; spreading infection | Healer intervention required |
| **Hours 24–72** | Systemic infection; convulsions; respiratory failure | Fatal without advanced treatment |

---

## Field Protocols

### Stand-off Requirements

| Condition | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Scrap Pools** | Avoid wading; never cast nets across wreck alleys |
| **River Crossings** | Reinforced fords only; chain-weighted scare lines ahead of hull |
| **Glint Clusters** | Mark with riverstones; no probing; route around |
| **Livestock Transit** | Corral behind noise curtains; never allow waterline access |

### Detection and Early Warning

**Black-Flag Indicators:**

| Indicator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Glint in Water** | Metal reflection near eddies or submerged wreckage |
| **Shard Cache Mounds** | Shed teeth sorted by size near deep pools |
| **Ragged Net Damage** | Torn fishing nets with embedded metal fragments |
| **"Tink" Sounds** | Metallic testing harmonics from submerged position |
| **Riverbed Stillness** | Unnatural lack of small fish near scrap concentrations |

### Field Card: Skegg-ox Protocols

| Phase | Protocol |
|-------|----------|
| **BEFORE** | Use sounding pole and scrap-glint scan upstream of eddies; identify shard cache mounds and mark with riverstones (no probing); favor shallows with fast laminar flow; avoid eddy lines near wrecks; cross at reinforced fords only |
| **DURING (Transit)** | Use chain-weighted scare lines ahead of hull; keep livestock corralled behind noise curtains; maintain visual scanning for glint signatures; if crossing by foot, use designated ford points only |
| **DURING (Interdiction)** | Baffle with chumless decoy bundles; harpoon only at surface lunge; never hand-line over suspected lair; if kill necessary, secure jaw separately in rigid cradle |
| **AFTER** | Conduct Blight-Tetanus screening for any personnel with water contact; document glint positions and shard cache locations; update guild charts; if wound occurred: immediate fragment removal, aggressive cleaning, healer consultation within 6 hours |

### BLACK-FLAG Conditions

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Glint cluster detected** | Abort crossing; reroute to reinforced ford |
| **Net torn with embedded fragments** | Immediate net abandonment; assess crew for bites |
| **"Tink" sounds from water** | Active Skegg-ox nearby; abort all water operations |
| **Livestock agitation at waterline** | Withdraw animals; do not investigate |
| **Personnel bitten** | Immediate wound care; Blight-Tetanus protocol activation |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Wading crossings at scrap pools** | Ambush territory; near-certain strike |
| **Casting seine nets across wreck alleys** | Nets attract territorial response; tear damage; crew exposure |
| **Butchering over waterline** | Blood attracts territorial defense; secondary strikes |
| **Hand-lining over suspected lair** | Explosive lunge can pull handler into water |
| **Swimming in marked Skegg-ox waters** | Direct exposure to ambush predation |

## Factional Perspectives

### Midgard Combine: The Fisherman's Bane

| Assessment | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Risk Classification** | Constant menace to river-dependent economy |
| **Infrastructure Damage** | Tears nets; capsizes small boats; damages ferry operations |
| **Casualty Type** | Livestock losses; fisherman injuries and deaths |
| **Chart Marking** | "Skegg-ox waters" prominently marked on all guild charts |

**Economic Impact:** Skegg-ox territories effectively close entire river sections to commercial fishing, ferry transit, and livestock watering. The Combine maintains extensive ford reinforcement programs and scare-line equipment distribution.

**Cultural Significance:** "River-King Below" features prominently in Combine folklore—a reminder that the waterways, like everything else in Aethelgard, demand respect and caution.

> *"To the people of the Midgard Combine, the Skegg-ox is a constant menace. It can tear through fishing nets, capsize small boats, and has been known to drag livestock and unwary fishermen to a grisly end."*

### Scavenger Barons: The Bodge-Prize

| Assessment | Value |
|------------|-------|
| **Risk Classification** | High-risk, high-reward hunting target |
| **Meat** | Edible if carefully cleaned; tough but nutritious |
| **Hide** | Excellent leather quality; durable |
| **Jaw** | Pre-collected, pre-sharpened metal shard bounty |

**Economic Calculus:** A successful Skegg-ox kill provides immediate return—flesh for eating, hide for crafting, and most valuably, the jaw itself: a ready-made arsenal of arrowheads, knife blades, and weapon components.

**"Jawbone Axe":** The quintessential scavenger weapon—a sturdy club with Skegg-ox jaw shards embedded in its striking surface. Embodies the "art of the bodge": turning the world's dangers into the world's tools.

> *"While feared, the creature is also a strange resource. A skilled hunter who manages to kill a Skegg-ox can harvest a valuable bounty: edible flesh, tough hide, and a jaw that is a pre-collected assortment of high-quality, pre-sharpened metal shards."*

### Dvergr Forge-Masters: The Natural Forgery

| Assessment | Value |
|------------|-------|
| **Scientific Interest** | Fascination with "natural industry" |
| **Metallurgical Value** | Elder jaws contain rare pre-Glitch alloy fragments |
| **Geological Indicator** | Jaw composition reveals upriver ruin contents |
| **Research Priority** | Bio-soldering mechanism; alloy selection behavior |

**The Perfect Example:** Dvergr see the Skegg-ox as a horrifying but perfect demonstration of natural engineering—a creature that has independently developed a crude but effective forge-selection process.

**Assay Operations:** Dvergr Artificers pay premium prices for particularly old Skegg-ox jaws. The embedded shards are often fragments of rare, valuable pre-Glitch alloys that the creature has unknowingly collected and preserved. An elder jaw is a "quantifiable geological indicator" revealing the composition of hidden ruins.

> *"The Dvergr are fascinated by the Skegg-ox. They see it as a perfect, if horrifying, example of 'natural industry.' They will pay a high price for the jaw of a particularly old Skegg-ox, as the shards it has chosen for itself are often of a rare and valuable pre-Glitch alloy."*

### Jötun-Readers: The Elegant Horror

| Research Priority | Value |
|-------------------|-------|
| **Purpose Inversion Study** | Prime example of evolutionary adaptation to post-Glitch conditions |
| **Bio-Soldering Mechanism** | Unique biological process for metal integration |
| **Behavioral Evolution** | Learned behavior transmission across generations |
| **Ecological Role** | Apex aquatic predator in scrap-rich environments |

**Academic Significance:** The Skegg-ox represents a textbook case of purpose inversion—a creature designed for one function that has completely repurposed its capabilities for an inverted role.

**Lead Ecologist's Assessment:** *"The Vanir made a creature to clean their perfect world. The world broke, and the creature, in its simple, brutal wisdom, adapted. It is now a perfect cleaner for a world made of rust and bone. It eats the old world and turns it into teeth. There is a terrible, elegant logic to it that even a Dvergr would respect."*

### Rangers Guild: The River Hazard

| Assessment | Protocol |
|------------|----------|
| **Route Classification** | Skegg-ox territories marked as hazard zones |
| **Escort Premium** | Elevated rates for river-crossing protection |
| **Training Requirement** | Scare-line deployment; glint-scanning; Blight-Tetanus protocol |
| **Intelligence Priority** | Shard cache mapping; territorial boundary documentation |

**Operational Doctrine:** Rangers maintain comprehensive Skegg-ox territory maps, regularly updated through patrol observations and incident reports. River crossings in known territories require specialized equipment and heightened vigilance.

### Iron-Banes: The Rusted Hunger

| Classification | Interpretation |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Theological Status** | Creature corrupted by proximity to the old world's bones |
| **Symbolic Reading** | The Blight weaponizes even the most mundane tools |
| **Moral Lesson** | Nothing escapes corruption; even janitors become killers |

**Doctrinal Significance:** The Skegg-ox demonstrates that the Blight's corruption extends to all things—even a simple maintenance creature becomes a weapon when surrounded by the refuse of the fallen age.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)

*"The River-King Below, whose smile is a row of rusted daggers, whose kiss is the fever-death that takes you slow. It waits in the deep pools where the old world's bones lie tangled, patient as the grave, hungry as the rust that eats all things. Do not trust the glint in the water. Do not reach for the treasure that gleams. The Blade-Pike has learned to bait its hook with the shine of a forgotten age."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)

*"A feral Vanir bio-asset exhibiting complete purpose inversion. The Flumen-Purger's debris-processing adaptations—powerful jaw musculature, robust digestive system, bottom-dwelling behavior—have been repurposed for ambush predation following environmental pressure from the Souring. The defining adaptation is behavioral-anatomical: intentional integration of scavenged metal shards into modified jaw sockets, creating a continuously-renewed 'dentition' of industrial debris. Blight-Tetanus vectoring via bite is the primary mortality mechanism; direct physical trauma is secondary."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)

*"Flumen-Purger Pattern Aquatic Sanitizer (feral). Original function: organic debris processing for Midgard waterway maintenance. Post-Glitch adaptation: behavioral exaptation enabling metal shard integration into fibrous gum tissue via bio-soldering mechanism. Jaw modification creates functional dentition from environmental ferrous debris. Predation strategy: territorial ambush in scrap-concentrated aquatic environments. Bite mechanism: irregular shard geometry produces tearing rather than cutting wounds; bacterial and Blight-particulate load on corroded metal creates secondary infection vector (Blight-Tetanus). Mortality: 95%+ untreated within 72 hours of bite exposure."*

## Summary

The Skegg-ox is adaptation made predator.

It was designed to be the perfect janitor—placid, methodical, unseen, grinding away the imperfections of a perfect world. Its powerful jaw plates were engineered to process debris. Its robust digestive system was built to break down whatever the rivers collected. Its bottom-dwelling nature made it invisible, efficient, essential.

And it worked. All of it worked. **Perfectly.**

That is the tragedy.

The Glitch did not corrupt the Skegg-ox's core systems. It did not shatter its jaw or break its patience. The creature's processing capabilities emerged from the catastrophe intact—but the world it was built to clean had become a graveyard of metal.

The only thing that was lost was the diet.

The pristine organic debris. The algae blooms. The natural waste of a curated ecosystem.

Now the rivers are choked with steel.

And so the Purger did what it was designed to do. It processed what the rivers provided. It ground its teeth against Adamant-Weave until they shattered. It starved in the ruins of a world it was built to maintain.

But some survived.

Some learned.

They learned to take the metal that broke their teeth and **make it into teeth**.

Generation after generation, the behavior passed down. The jaw evolved to hold the shards. The scavenger became a smith. The janitor became a killer.

And now it waits in the deep pools where the old world's bones lie tangled.

Patient as rust.

Hungry as the age that made it.

Its smile is a row of rusted daggers.

And its bite is the kiss of a forgotten world that has never, ever stopped teaching the lesson:

**Adapt or die.**
