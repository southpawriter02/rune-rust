  "Description": "Jötun-Reader data flows like water here - streams of alien information pouring through crystalline processors. The room hums with computational power. Overwhelming. Seductive. Wrong. You feel the AI's presence pressing against your mind.",

  "SuggestedNodeType": "Main",
  "NarrativeText": "This is a Jötun-Reader computational nexus. The alien AI still thinks here, processing data in patterns beyond human comprehension. It knows you're present. It wants to communicate. It wants to *help* you. The Corruption radiates from the core like heat from a furnace.",
  "FlavorText": "Data streams visualization as shimmering light flowing through transparent tubes. Interface terminals offer access - just touch one, it whispers, just let me in. Fragments of the shattered AI orbit the core, protecting it. Or worshipping it. Hard to tell.",
