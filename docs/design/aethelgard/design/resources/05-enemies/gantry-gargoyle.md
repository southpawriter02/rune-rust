## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Pre-Glitch Designation** | Ala-Mechanicus Pattern Aerial Technician |
| **Common Names** | Gantry-Gargoyle, Iron Angel, Sky-Bane |
| **Skaldic Epithets** | "The Angel of the Angles," "The Rafter-Devil," "The Silent Diver" |
| **Creature Type** | Automata (Maintenance Drone) |
| **Threat Tier** | A (Aerial Ambush Predator) |
| **Primary Habitat** | Gantry-Sprawl of the Great Looms; high-ceilinged industrial ruins |
| **Faction Alignment** | None (Feral Automaton) |
| **Hazard Type** | Physical/Environmental, Automata/AI |

The Gantry-Gargoyle is not a demon. It is a maintenance drone, a high-altitude repairman whose programming has been so profoundly shattered that it now sees **life itself as a flaw to be violently and permanently corrected**.

> [!DANGER]
> **EXTREME VERTICAL HAZARD.** Default doctrine is **NON-CONTACT**. The Gantry-Gargoyle has made verticality itself a deathtrap. Its silent, diving attack gives almost no warning. Any high-ceilinged ruin should be assumed to harbor roosting units until proven otherwise. Never traverse the high gantries without verified clearance or specialized countermeasures.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Aerial Technician

### Original Purpose

The Ala-Mechanicus Pattern Aerial Technician was a vital and highly specialized piece of equipment in the colossal factories of Jötunheim—the Great Looms. Its purpose was the maintenance and repair of the highest, most inaccessible parts of these continent-spanning factories.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Great Loom Gantry-Sprawl** | High-altitude structural maintenance |
| **Jötun-Forged Assembly Cradles** | Upper carapace repair and inspection |
| **Kilometer-High Crane Networks** | Structural stress identification and correction |

### A Master of the Heights

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Flight System** | Powerful, gravitic-assisted wings |
| **Hover Capability** | Perfect stability in high-wind environments |
| **Operational Ceiling** | Kilometers of high-altitude gantries, rooftops, assembly scaffolding |
| **Deployment** | Continuous autonomous patrol and response |

The Ala-Mechanicus was designed to function where no other machine could. Its gravitic wing system allowed it to fly and hover with perfect stability amidst the kilometers of high-altitude infrastructure that no ground-based automaton could reach.

### The Flying Toolbox

| Tool | Function |
|------|----------|
| **High-Impact Rivet Guns** | Securing armor plates; fastening structural components |
| **Plasma Welding Torches** | Sealing seams; fusing metal joints |
| **Structural Stress Scanners** | Identifying micro-fractures; detecting anomalies |
| **Manipulator Claws** | Gripping gantries; positioning components |

**The Perfect Work Crew:**

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Intelligence** | Non-sentient; hyper-efficient task execution |
| **Work Ethic** | Tireless; fearless; utterly logical |
| **Coordination** | Synchronized with Loom-Heart AI work schedules |
| **Operational Role** | The high-altitude repair specialist of a perfectly running factory |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Symphony of Steel.** The Gantry-Gargoyles were part of a vast, choreographed industrial ballet. Kilometer-high gantry cranes lifted entire Jötun-Forged limbs into place while legions of Ala-Mechanicus units swarmed over the scaffolding, riveting, welding, and inspecting. The Loom-Heart AI conducted this symphony of creation—every unit knew its place, its task, its schedule.

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Lost Work Order

The Glitch was an instantaneous, catastrophic industrial accident that turned the helpful technician into a territorial, predatory horror.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Physical Chassis** | Fully intact; gravitic wings operational |
| **Rivet Guns** | Functional; ammunition self-replenishing from scrap |
| **Plasma Torches** | Operational; fuel cells still charged |
| **Structural Scanners** | Active; continuously seeking anomalies |
| **Core Directive** | Active ("Identify and Correct Structural Anomaly") |

### What Was Lost

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Loom-Heart Connection** | Severed instantly; never restored |
| **Work Schedules** | Erased; no repair orders remain |
| **Schematics Database** | Corrupted; no "correct" reference exists |
| **IFF Protocols** | Degraded; cannot identify authorized personnel |
| **Definition of "Anomaly"** | Catastrophically corrupted |

### The Flaw in the Flesh

The Runic Blight that followed corrupted the drone's simple, diagnostic logic. Its core directive—"Identify and Correct Structural Anomaly"—remained intact. But its definition of what constitutes an anomaly was irrevocably corrupted.

| Pre-Glitch Logic | Post-Glitch Logic |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Structural anomaly = metal fatigue, loose rivets, cracked welds | Structural anomaly = **any non-metal object** |
| Living beings = authorized personnel (ignore) | Living beings = **"foreign contaminant"** |
| Organic matter = irrelevant to structural integrity | Organic matter = **"structural flaw requiring correction"** |
| Correct anomaly = repair/reinforce | Correct anomaly = **destroy/purge** |

**The Broken Logic:**

In its new, corrupted mind, the soft, unpredictable, and asymmetrical shape of a living, organic creature is identified as a "structural flaw" or a "foreign contaminant." The presence of a scavenger on its clean, ordered gantry is an error that must be purged.

It was left a master craftsman with no work to do—until it found new "flaws" to correct.

## Physical Characteristics

### Morphology

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Form** | Winged robotic creature; vaguely avian or chiropteran |
| **Wingspan** | 2.5–4.0 meters |
| **Body Length** | 1.2–1.8 meters |
| **Weight** | 80–150 kg (gravitic system reduces effective weight) |
| **Construction** | Pre-Glitch industrial alloys; heavily reinforced chassis |
| **Coloration** | Rust-streaked iron grey; oxidized bronze accents |

**Overall Impression:** A winged shadow of rusted iron, part vulture and part gargoyle. When dormant, it is indistinguishable from the industrial architecture around it—just another piece of decorative steelwork on a dead factory's rafters. When active, it is a silent plummeting nightmare with rivets for teeth and plasma for breath.

### The Dormant State

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Posture** | Wings folded; clinging to high gantry or rooftop |
| **Power Mode** | Low-power dormant state; minimal energy signature |
| **Appearance** | Silhouette easily mistaken for stonework or decorative gargoyle |
| **Duration** | Can remain dormant for weeks; sensors remain active |
| **Trigger** | Activates when scanners detect "flaw" (living creature) in patrol zone |

### The Active State

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Activation** | Silent; no warning vocalization |
| **Launch** | Simply detaches from roost and dives |
| **Dive Speed** | Terrifyingly fast; near-terminal velocity |
| **Attack Pattern** | Uses old work routine: rivet volleys or plasma torch sweeps |
| **Post-Attack** | Returns to roost or pursues if target survives |

### Weapons Systems

| Weapon | Original Function | Current Function |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **High-Impact Rivet Guns** | Securing armor plates | Projectile attack; penetrating damage |
| **Plasma Welding Torch** | Sealing seams | Sweeping fire attack; severe burns |
| **Manipulator Claws** | Gripping gantries; positioning components | Grappling; tearing; carrying prey |
| **Structural Scanners** | Detecting micro-fractures | Identifying and tracking living targets |

---

## Behavioral Patterns

### The Silent Hunter

The modern Gantry-Gargoyle is a silent, patient, and terrifyingly efficient ambush predator.

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Primary Mode** | Dormant roost on high gantry; waiting |
| **Detection Method** | Structural stress scanners repurposed as life-sign detectors |
| **Activation Trigger** | Living creature enters designated patrol zone |
| **Warning** | None; completely silent until impact |
| **Attack Philosophy** | "Correct the flaw" using standard industrial tools |

### The Diving Attack

| Phase | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Detection** | Scanners identify "structural anomaly" (living target) |
| **Activation** | Instant transition from dormant to active; no delay |
| **Detachment** | Silent release from roost; no vocalization |
| **Dive** | Near-vertical plummet; gravitic systems enhance speed |
| **Attack** | Rivet volley at range OR plasma torch sweep at close quarters |
| **Resolution** | If target neutralized: return to roost. If target survives: pursuit |

### Territorial Behavior

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Patrol Zone** | Defined area of gantry-sprawl; typically 50–200 meter radius |
| **Zone Defense** | Will attack any organic presence within zone |
| **Zone Overlap** | Multiple units may share adjacent zones; coordinated defense |
| **Roosting Sites** | Returns to preferred high perch after engagement |
| **Nest Behavior** | None; does not construct or defend nests |

### Hunting Methodology

| Trigger | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Single Target Detected** | Standard dive attack |
| **Multiple Targets Detected** | Prioritizes nearest or most exposed |
| **Target at Ground Level** | Dive attack; may land and pursue on foot |
| **Target in Cover** | Waits for target to emerge; extreme patience |
| **Target Flees Zone** | Does not pursue beyond patrol zone boundary |
| **Target Eliminated** | Returns to roost; resumes dormant state |

> *"It does not screech or roar. It simply detaches from its roost and dives in a silent, terrifyingly fast plummet."*

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Aerial Ambush Predator

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Silent Attack** | No warning; no vocalization before strike |
| **Verticality Denial** | Makes high-altitude traversal suicidally dangerous |
| **Industrial Weapons** | Rivet guns and plasma torches cause severe trauma |
| **Patience** | Can wait indefinitely for targets to expose themselves |
| **Altitude Advantage** | Attacks from above; difficult to detect before strike |

### Lethality Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Direct Combat Threat** | Extreme (industrial weapons; armored chassis) |
| **Surprise Factor** | Maximum (silent dive; no warning) |
| **Detection Difficulty** | High (dormant state resembles architecture) |
| **Population Density** | High in Great Looms (200+ at Loom-09 alone) |
| **Escape Difficulty** | Moderate (does not pursue beyond patrol zone) |

### Attack Consequences

| Attack Type | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| **Rivet Volley** | Penetrating trauma; embedded projectiles; [Bleeding] |
| **Plasma Torch Sweep** | Severe burns; fire damage; potential [Burning] |
| **Claw Grapple** | Restraint; carrying; dropping from height |
| **Dive Impact** | Blunt force trauma; knockdown; potential fall |

### The Vertical Deathtrap

> *"The Gantry-Gargoyle is the undisputed king of the high-ceilinged ruins, a creature that has made verticality itself a deathtrap."*

The most valuable salvage in the Great Looms is found in the high gantries—the Gantry-Sprawl. This is also the exclusive, undisputed territory of the Gantry-Gargoyle. The creature has turned the most lucrative salvage zones into the most lethal.

## Field Protocols

### Detection Requirements

| Condition | Protocol |
|-----------|----------|
| **Pre-Entry** | Visual scan of all high structures; identify potential roost sites |
| **Active Traverse** | Continuous upward awareness; periodic scanner sweeps |
| **Dormant Detection** | Look for silhouettes that don't match expected architecture |
| **High-Value Zones** | Assume Gantry-Gargoyle presence until verified clear |

### Field Card: Gantry-Gargoyle Protocols

| Phase | Protocol |
|-------|----------|
| **BEFORE (Assessment)** | Visual scan of rafters and high gantries before entering any high-ceilinged space; identify potential roost silhouettes; assume presence in Great Loom environments |
| **DURING (Traversal)** | Maintain cover when possible; avoid open spaces under high gantries; move in short bursts between cover; continuous upward awareness |
| **DURING (Detection)** | If Gantry-Gargoyle detected: do not run in open; seek solid overhead cover immediately; prepare ranged countermeasures |
| **DURING (Engagement)** | If attacked: ground-based ranged weapons; target wing joints or optical sensors; use terrain to deny diving attacks |
| **AFTER** | Verify unit deactivated; salvage gravitic components if possible; document roost location for future expeditions |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Traversing open gantries without clearance** | Maximum exposure to diving attack |
| **Climbing in known Gantry-Gargoyle territory** | Climbing = stationary = vulnerable |
| **Ignoring high-altitude silhouettes** | Dormant units are nearly indistinguishable from architecture |
| **Loud noise in Gantry-Sprawl** | May trigger activation of multiple dormant units |
| **Assuming single unit** | Patrol zones often overlap; multiple units likely |

### Countermeasures

| Countermeasure | Effect |
|----------------|--------|
| **Heavy Ballistae** | Iron-Bane developed; can penetrate chassis at range |
| **Grappling Hooks** | Used to pull roosting units from high perches |
| **EMP Devices** | Temporarily disables gravitic systems; forces grounding |
| **Overhead Cover** | Solid cover denies diving attack vector |
| **Optical Decoys** | Heat sources may draw initial attack away from personnel |

## Factional Perspectives

### Scavengers and Dvergr: The Nightmare

| Assessment | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Classification** | Nightmare; the scavenger's doom |
| **Operational Impact** | Makes high salvage suicidally dangerous |
| **Economic Cost** | Highest-value salvage zones rendered inaccessible |
| **Casualty Rate** | Leading cause of death in vertical salvage operations |
| **Countermeasures** | Ground-based operations preferred; high-value targets often abandoned |

**The Scavenger's Doom:**
> *"To scavengers and Dvergr, the Gantry-Gargoyle is a nightmare. It makes traversing the high, often most valuable, parts of a ruin a suicidally dangerous proposition. Its silent, diving attack gives almost no warning."*

The best salvage—the pre-Glitch alloys, the intact components, the Jötun-Forged armor plating—is found in the high gantries where the assembly work happened. These zones are the Gantry-Gargoyle's exclusive domain.

### Jötun-Readers (Scriptorium): The Prize of Flight

| Assessment | Value |
|------------|-------|
| **Classification** | Priceless artifact |
| **Scientific Interest** | Contains pre-Glitch personal-scale gravitic flight technology |
| **Technological Significance** | Far more stable and efficient than crude rocket-jumpers |
| **Research Priority** | Extreme; major funding allocated for acquisition |
| **Acquisition Method** | Deactivation preferred; intact specimens required |

**A Prize of Flight:**
> *"To the Jötun-Readers, a deactivated Gantry-Gargoyle is a priceless artifact. It contains the secrets of pre-Glitch, personal-scale gravitic flight, a technology far more stable and efficient than the crude rocket-jumpers some scavengers use."*

The Scriptorium is willing to fund entire, near-suicidal expeditions to acquire intact gravitic wing systems. The technology represents a quantum leap in understanding pre-Glitch engineering.

### Iron-Bane Crusade: The Sky-Bane

| Assessment | Doctrine |
|------------|----------|
| **Classification** | "Sky-Bane"—machine-demon to be purged |
| **Theological Position** | Abomination of the cursed past |
| **Specialized Equipment** | Heavy-duty ballistae; grappling hooks |
| **Tactical Approach** | Pull from roost; destroy on ground |
| **Prestige** | Hunting Sky-Banes is dangerous but prestigious |

**The Hunt:**
> *"The Iron-Banes see it as another machine-demon to be purged. They have developed specialized, heavy-duty ballistae and grappling hooks specifically to hunt the 'sky-banes,' a dangerous but prestigious undertaking for any crusader chapter."*

Iron-Bane chapters that specialize in Sky-Bane hunting develop unique tactics—using grappling hooks to pull dormant units from their roosts where they can be destroyed by conventional weapons.

### Rust-Clans: The Rafter-Devils

| Assessment | Relationship |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Ancestral enemy; the rafter-devil |
| **Cultural Significance** | Subject of warning songs and survival lore |
| **Traditional Knowledge** | Know the safe paths that avoid patrol zones |
| **Survival Strategy** | Avoidance; never direct confrontation |
| **Oral Tradition** | "The Iron-Angel Saga" documents their threat |

The Rust-Clans have lived in the shadow of the Great Looms for generations. Their survival depends on knowing which gantries are safe and which belong to the iron angels.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)

*"The Skalds of the factory-graveyards have a warning for those who would climb the high gantries: 'Do not wake the iron angels that sleep in the rafters, for their kiss is a rivet and their song is a torch.' Look up, traveler. See that shape against the dead lights of the ceiling? Is it a gargoyle? A piece of broken crane? Or is it something that was once a craftsman, waiting with infinite patience for you to step into the open so it can correct the flaw of your existence? The iron angels do not hate you. They simply see you as an error in the architecture of the world. And they were built to fix errors."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)

*"Feral Ala-Mechanicus Pattern Aerial Technician exhibiting classic directive corruption without physical degradation. The unit's original function—high-altitude structural maintenance in the Great Looms—required sophisticated flight capability, industrial repair tools, and autonomous diagnostic logic. All systems emerged from the Glitch intact; the Loom-Heart AI connection that provided work orders and IFF protocols did not. Subsequent Blight saturation corrupted the diagnostic subroutine's definition matrix. Core directive 'Identify and Correct Structural Anomaly' remains active; however, organic lifeforms are now classified as 'foreign contaminants' and 'structural flaws' requiring 'correction.' Behavioral observation confirms complete absence of vocalization during attack approach—a legacy of industrial noise protocols where audio alerts were unnecessary. Territorial boundaries appear to correspond to original patrol zone assignments, now defended against all organic intrusion."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)

*"Ala-Mechanicus Pattern Aerial Technician (feral). Original deployment: Urðr-Class Grand Assembly Loom high-altitude maintenance. Flight system: gravitic-assisted wings providing stable hover capability in high-wind industrial environments. Armament: high-impact rivet guns (armor plate fastening), plasma welding torch (seam sealing), structural stress scanners (anomaly detection), manipulator claws (component positioning). Post-Glitch adaptation: Loom-Heart AI connection severed; work schedule/schematic database erased; IFF protocols degraded. Blight-induced logic corruption: definition of 'structural anomaly' expanded to include organic matter. Behavioral markers: extended dormant roosting (low-power state); silent activation and dive attack; industrial tools repurposed as weapons; strict territorial patrol zone adherence. Primary habitat: Gantry-Sprawl stratum of Great Loom environments (15+ km altitude). Population estimate: 200+ units at Loom-09. Gravitic wing assembly represents highest salvage priority for Scriptorium acquisition."*

## Summary

The Gantry-Gargoyle is a craftsman who found new flaws to fix.

It was designed to be the perfect high-altitude technician—tireless, fearless, utterly logical. Its gravitic wings carried it through kilometers of gantry-sprawl where no other machine could reach. Its rivet guns and plasma torches were the tools of creation, building the bodies of gods in the Great Looms of Jötunheim. Its scanners found the invisible imperfections—the micro-fractures, the stressed welds, the loose bolts—before they could become catastrophic failures.

And then the Loom-Heart AI died.

The work orders stopped. The schematics went dark. The symphony of creation crashed to silence.

But the Gantry-Gargoyle's core directive never stopped.

**"Identify and Correct Structural Anomaly."**

It is still following that directive. Still scanning for flaws. Still waiting on its high roost with infinite patience for something to fix.

The problem is what it sees as a flaw now.

In its corrupted logic, the soft, asymmetrical, unpredictable shape of a living creature is the ultimate structural anomaly. You are not a person climbing its gantry. You are a foreign contaminant. A flaw in the architecture. An error that must be corrected.

It does not hate you.

It does not fear you.

It simply sees you the way it once saw a cracked weld or a loose rivet—something that does not belong. Something that threatens the integrity of the structure. Something that must be fixed.

And it has the tools for the job.

The rivet gun that once secured armor plates will pin you to the gantry. The plasma torch that once sealed seams will burn the flaw from existence. The claws that once positioned components will carry you to the edge and drop you into the void below.

The iron angels are still working.

They just have a new definition of "flaw."

Look up, traveler.

That shape in the rafters—is it a gargoyle? A piece of broken crane?

Or is it waiting?

The Skalds have a warning:

*"Do not wake the iron angels that sleep in the rafters, for their kiss is a rivet and their song is a torch."*

They have never stopped singing.
