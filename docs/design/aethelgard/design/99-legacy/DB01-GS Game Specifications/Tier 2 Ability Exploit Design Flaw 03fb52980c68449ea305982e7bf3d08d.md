### **Ability Overview**

**Specialization:** Jötun-Reader (System Pathologist)

**Tier:** 2 (Advanced Tactical Support)

**Type:** Active (Standard Action)

**Prerequisite:** 8 PP spent in the Jötun-Reader tree

**Cost:** 4 PP

### **Description**

After identifying a weakness through diagnostic observation, the Jötun-Reader clearly communicates the flaw to their allies, directing their strikes with precise clinical instructions: "Strike the left knee joint—the actuator is damaged," "The armor plating is weakest along the dorsal seam," "Its reaction time to attacks from the right is slower by 0.3 seconds."

### **Mechanics**

**Action Cost:** Standard Action, 35 Stamina

**Requirement:** Can only be used on a target whose weaknesses have already been successfully analyzed using **Analyze Weakness**.

**Effect:** Applies the **[Analyzed]** debuff to a single enemy for 2 rounds. While this debuff is active:

- All attacks made against this target gain a **+2 bonus to their Accuracy dice pools**
- The Jötun-Reader's clinical guidance helps allies exploit the documented weakness with precision

**Communication:** This is the Jötun-Reader verbally or gesturally communicating tactical information to allies. It requires line of sight to both the target and the allies being coordinated.

### **Thematic Justification**

This ability represents the second half of the Jötun-Reader's "observe → document → exploit" workflow. After diagnosing the problem (Analyze Weakness), they translate that forensic knowledge into practical tactical advice. Think of them as a surgical assistant calling out anatomical landmarks, or a spotter guiding a sniper's aim.

### **Progression & Milestones**

### **Rank 1 (Foundational)**

- **Stamina Cost:** 35
- **Effect:** Apply [Analyzed] debuff (+2 Accuracy for all allies) for 2 rounds
- **Requirement:** Target must have been successfully Analyzed first

### **Rank 2 (Expert)**

- **Unlocked:** 20 PP invested in Jötun-Reader tree
- **Effect:** [Analyzed] debuff now grants **+3 Accuracy** and lasts **3 rounds**

### **Rank 3 (Mastery)**

- **Unlocked:** Capstone ability unlocked (35-40 PP in tree)
- **Stamina Cost:** Reduced to 25
- **Effect:** [Analyzed] grants **+4 Accuracy** and lasts **4 rounds**
- **Additional Effect:** All attacks against target also gain **+1 bonus die to damage rolls**
- **Requirement Removed:** No longer requires prior Analyze Weakness (can identify weaknesses mid-combat)

---

### **Tactical Applications**

- **Boss Fights:** Turn 1: Analyze Weakness → Turn 2: Exploit Design Flaw → Remaining turns: Party capitalizes on +2 Accuracy
- **Elite Enemies:** Priority targets benefit most from the accuracy buff
- **Coordinated Strikes:** Enables "nova" strategies with improved hit chance

### **Synergies**

- **High-Accuracy Attackers:** Hólmgangr, Rangers, Vargr-Born gain maximum value
- **Critical-Focused Builds:** +2 Accuracy increases critical hit probability
- **Damage Dealers:** Berserkr, Strandhögg benefit from increased hit reliability
