## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Radical Self-Reliance I is the **foundational doctrine and core identity** of the Einbúi—representing the broad, practical, hard-won knowledge of a true survivor. They are not a master of any one trade, but a journeyman of *all* of them.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** +2 bonus dice to Tracking checks
- **Secondary:** +2 bonus dice to Foraging checks
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The skill-monkey survivalist who does everything competently

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High (reliable utility bonuses)
- **Non-Combat Focus:** Primary benefit in exploration
- **Party Value:** Directly supports crafters and healers via foraging

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Einbúi has not had the luxury of mastering a single, elegant craft. A life of solitude and hardship has forced them to learn a little bit of everything. They can read a trail, identify edible plants, and find shelter—not with brilliance, but with the **grinding competence of necessity**.

### Thematic Resonance

Radical Self-Reliance establishes the Einbúi as the ultimate generalist—proof that versatility born of hardship is its own form of mastery.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Skill Bonuses

**Passive Effect:**

- +2 bonus dice to **Wasteland Survival (Tracking)** checks
- +2 bonus dice to **Wasteland Survival (Foraging)** checks

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Trigger:** Character attempts qualifying skill check
2. **Passive Check:** Does character have Radical Self-Reliance I?
3. **Context Validation:** Is this a Tracking or Foraging check?
4. **Bonus Application:** If yes, add +2 dice to pool

---

## IV. Progression Path

### Rank 1 (Base — This Ability)

- +2 dice to Tracking and Foraging

### Rank 2 (Expert — 20 PP)

- +4 dice to Tracking and Foraging

### Rank 3 (Mastery — Capstone)

- +4 dice to Tracking and Foraging
- **New:** Critical Success on Foraging yields double resources

---

## V. Tactical Applications

1. **Tracking:** Follow enemy trails, find shortcuts
2. **Foraging:** Gather reagents for crafters and healers
3. **Party Support:** Enable Bone-Setter and Brewmaster abilities
4. **Resource Economy:** Reduce supply costs for expeditions

---

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Bone-Setter/Brewmaster:** Foraging supplies their crafting
- **Veiðimaðr:** Can share tracking duties
- **High-WITS builds:** Massive dice pools for checks

### Negative Synergies

- **Combat focus:** No direct combat benefit
- **Urban campaigns:** Less value in civilized areas
