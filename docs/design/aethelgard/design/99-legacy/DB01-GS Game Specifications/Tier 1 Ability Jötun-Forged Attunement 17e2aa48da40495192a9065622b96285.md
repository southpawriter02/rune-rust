## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Jötun-Forged Attunement is the God-Sleeper Cultist's **defining core mechanic**—a heretical connection to the dormant machine gods that grants immense power at the cost of inevitable corruption. This establishes the specialization's high-risk, high-reward identity.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Grant [Attuned] status in Jötunheim or near Jötun-Forged/Undying
- **Primary:** 25% AP cost reduction on all abilities while [Attuned]
- **Cost:** Passive Runic Blight Corruption accumulation
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The fanatical faith that opens one's mind to the sleeping gods

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Extremely high (25% cost reduction on all abilities)
- **Environmental Dependency:** Only active in specific locations
- **Corruption Trade-off:** Steady corruption gain creates time pressure
- **Heretical Identity:** Defines the specialization's thematic core

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Cultist closes their eyes and **listens**. Beyond the wind, beyond the creaking metal, there is a *hum*—the psychic broadcast of a thousand dormant machine gods dreaming their corrupted dreams. The Cultist opens their mind to that signal, lets it flood through them, and feels the power of the God-Sleepers flow into their soul.

But the signal carries corruption. Every moment of attunement is a moment of infection. The Blight seeps in through the cracks in the Cultist's faith, promising power while slowly consuming them from within.

### Thematic Resonance

This is the Faustian bargain at the heart of the God-Sleeper path. The power is real. The corruption is also real. The question is whether the Cultist can accomplish their goals before the Blight claims them entirely.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### [Attuned] Trigger Conditions

**[Attuned] activates when the Cultist is:**

- In a [Jötunheim] biome
- In any room containing a dormant Jötun-Forged
- In any room with major Jötun-Forged wreckage
- In any room containing 3+ Undying enemies

### [Attuned] Effect

**While [Attuned]:**

- **AP Cost Reduction:** All God-Sleeper Cultist abilities cost **25% less Aether Pool**
- **Ability Enhancement:** Many abilities have enhanced effects while [Attuned]

### Corruption Cost

**While [Attuned]:**

- Cultist gains **1 Runic Blight Corruption** per combat round
- This corruption accumulates passively with no action required
- Corruption cannot be prevented while [Attuned]

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Location Check:** System verifies Cultist's current location/room contents
2. **Attunement Trigger:** If conditions met, grant [Attuned] status
3. **Cost Reduction Active:** All ability costs reduced by 25%
4. **Corruption Tick:** At end of each round while [Attuned], gain 1 Corruption
5. **Location Exit:** If conditions no longer met, remove [Attuned]

## IV. Progression Path

### Rank 1 (Base — This Ability)

- [Attuned] grants 25% AP cost reduction
- Passive 1 Corruption/round while [Attuned]

### Rank 2 (Expert — 20 PP)

- [Attuned] grants 30% AP cost reduction
- Passive 1 Corruption/round while [Attuned]
- **New:** [Attuned] now also grants +1 die to WILL-based checks

### Rank 3 (Mastery — Capstone)

- [Attuned] grants 33% AP cost reduction (integrates Conduit of the Sleeper)
- Passive 1 Corruption every 2 rounds while [Attuned] (slowed)
- +2 dice to WILL-based checks while [Attuned]
- **New:** Can voluntarily trigger [Attuned] anywhere by spending 5 Corruption (lasts 3 rounds)

---

## V. Tactical Applications

1. **Jötunheim Dominance:** Maximum power in primary biome for God-Sleepers
2. **Resource Efficiency:** 25% cost reduction enables ability spam
3. **Environmental Awareness:** Encourages fighting near machine god remnants
4. **Time Pressure:** Corruption accumulation creates urgency to end fights quickly
5. **Risk Management:** Balance power usage against corruption threshold

---

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **All God-Sleeper abilities:** Everything becomes cheaper while [Attuned]
- **Animate Scrap:** [Scrap Piles] often near Jötun-Forged = both conditions met
- **Conduit of the Sleeper (Tier 2):** Upgrades this passive further
- **High-WILL builds:** Can resist corruption effects longer

### Negative Synergies

- **Clean environments:** Vanaheim, Alfheim without Undying = no attunement
- **Low Corruption tolerance:** Characters close to Breaking should avoid extended [Attuned]
- **Anti-corruption builds:** Corruption gain may conflict with other strategies
