# (META) Setting Fundamentals: Canonical Ground Rules

---

## Purpose

This resource establishes canonical ground truth across **9 setting domains** and serves as the mandatory validation gate for Wave 2 content migration. It provides governance checklists to identify contradictions before content enters v5.0.

### Strategic Function

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Governance-first approach** | Document canonical ground rules before migrating content |
| **Contradiction detection** | Systematic validation questions per domain |
| **Wave 2 blocker** | No content migrates until validated against these fundamentals |
| **Clean slate guarantee** | Ensures v5.0 begins with accurate, consistent worldbuilding |

---

## How to Use This Resource

### For Content Creators

- **Before drafting:** Review canonical statements for relevant domains
- **During drafting:** Apply validation questions to catch contradictions early
- **Before publishing:** Verify no forbidden contradictions present

### For Wave 2 Migration

- **Pre-migration validation:** Required first step before voice/template checks
- **Domain identification:** Identify which domains apply to content type (see Quick Reference Table in Wave 2 Integration section)
- **Contradiction resolution:** Pause migration if contradictions found; correct in v4.0 first
- **Post-migration spot-check:** Verify no contradictions imported to v5.0

### For Wave 1.5 Remediation

- **Content audit:** Query v4.0 Resources against validation questions
- **Priority ranking:** Use domain criticality to prioritize corrections
- **Batch remediation:** Apply domain-specific correction guidelines
- **Quality assurance:** Validate corrected pages before marking "Ready for Wave 2"

## Six Major Corrections

These corrections address systematic contradictions identified in v4.0 content:

| # | Correction | Description |
|---|------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Remove Galdr/Unraveled entities** | Consolidate data-wraith types; "Galdr" = evocation discipline only |
| 2 | **Add sentient races** | Gorge-Maws and Rune-Lupins canonical |
| 3 | **Pivot magic system** | Runes as focal points for post-Glitch Aetheric weaving; no traditional spellcasting |
| 4 | **Clarify tech constraints** | Technology works, knowledge doesn't; operational use without comprehension; lost precision measurement |
| 5 | **Redesign realm layout** | Vanaheim/Alfheim adjacent to Midgard (not overhead); sun visibility preserved |
| 6 | **Counter-Rune duality** | BOTH parasitic (feeds Blight) AND world-ending (genocidal reset) — Apocrypha-level paradox |

## ✨ Domain 3: Magic/Aetheric System

### ✅ Canonical Statements

- **Pre-Glitch:** No "magic" beyond runic surface effects; runes imbued power on host surfaces only
- **Post-Glitch:** Glitch "created" magic systems by enabling rune-based energy manipulation
- **Weaving disciplines:** Runes act as focal points/conduits; weavers sense, tap into, and manipulate Aetheric energy through runic channels
- **Nordic-themed variations:** Rune-Wardens, Shamans, Blot-Priests, Galdr-Casters (evokers only, not entities)
- **No traditional spellcasting:** No wizards, sorcerers, or fireball-throwing disciplines

### ❌ Forbidden Contradictions

- ❌ Pre-Glitch magic users
- ❌ Traditional spell-casting without runic focal points
- ❌ "Galdr" as entity type (Galdr = evocation discipline only)
- ❌ Unrestricted Aetheric manipulation without runes

### 🔍 Migration Validation Questions

## ⚙️ Domain 4: Technology Constraints

### ✅ Canonical Statements

- **800 years of decay:** Pre-Glitch systems persist but are malfunctioning, hazardous, unreliable; operating in corrupted/unintended capacity (e.g., Surtr Forges pollute instead of filter)
- **Semi-habitable at best:** Aethelgardians can make areas livable through improvisation but cannot restore Pre-Glitch control levels
- **Operational use without comprehension:** Can activate/use systems (lockpick consoles, trigger mechanisms, read Data-Slates) but cannot create, program, or modify them
- **Lost manufacturing capability:** No complex assembly for ~800 years; cannot create new Data-Slates or reprogram/rewrite existing content on slates
- **Lost precision measurement:** No capability to measure technical data (CPS thresholds, pH levels, Richter scales, diagnostic telemetry); Jötun-Readers lack comprehensive tools for truly scientific study
- **Scavenger/tinkerer culture:** Jury-riggers and bodge artists; Scavenger Barons keep Dreadnoughts semi-functional through improvisation, not mastery
- **Dvergr exceptionalism (limited):** More advanced due to discipline/lineage; skilled imitators (not innovators); Aether-blindness limits advancement
- **Cargo cult pathology:** Jötun-Readers are pathologists without proper diagnostic tools; study decay, not systems; oral tradition (Skaldic myths) replaces technical literacy

### ❌ Forbidden Contradictions

- ❌ Jötun-Readers with precision measurement/diagnostic tools
- ❌ Programming, modification, or manufacturing of Pre-Glitch systems
- ❌ Creating new Data-Slates or rewriting existing slate content
- ❌ Technical comprehension beyond operational use
- ❌ Dvergr as innovators (they're skilled imitators only)
- ❌ Pristine/reliable Pre-Glitch systems (800 years = decay/malfunction/repurposing)
- ❌ Jötun-Readers as "debuggers" or "programmers of reality"

### 🔍 Migration Validation Questions

- 🔍 Does this page describe Jötun-Reader measurement/diagnostic capabilities?
- 🔍 Does it reference programming, modification, or manufacturing?
- 🔍 Does it describe creating/rewriting Data-Slates?
- 🔍 Does it imply technical comprehension beyond operational use?
- 🔍 Does it present Dvergr as innovators rather than imitators?
- 🔍 Does it describe Pre-Glitch systems as pristine/reliable (should be decayed/malfunctioning)?
- 🔍 Does it present Jötun-Readers as debuggers/programmers?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Critical Note:** This domain expected to have highest remediation volume (50-75 Codex entries affected, particularly Field Card methodology references requiring precision thresholds).

## 🤖 Domain 6: Entity Types

### ✅ Canonical Statements

| Entity Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Draugr-Pattern** (Military/Security Automata) | Civil security units; patrol-loop corrupted; pacification tools became lethal; powered by Iron Hearts; predictable routes |
| **Haugbui-Class** (Heavy Labor Automata) | Construction/demolition units; task-loop corrupted (STACK/CLEAR/DECONSTRUCT); powered by Iron Hearts; obsessive task execution |
| **Symbiotic Plate** ("Iron Husk" AI) | DIFFERENT mechanism — bio-mechanical neural interface; bonds to living host; slowly subjugates consciousness; creates "Husks" (living puppets); corrupted AI assumes control |
| **Data-Wraith Consolidation** | Remove "Galdr" and "Unraveled" as separate entity types; "Galdr" = evocation discipline only |

**Distinction preserved:** Draugr/Haugbui = automata with Iron Hearts; Symbiotic Plate = parasitic AI interface

### ❌ Forbidden Contradictions

- ❌ Draugr/Haugbui terminology blurred or merged
- ❌ Symbiotic Plate as Iron Heart-powered automaton

## ⚠️ Domain 9: Counter-Rune Paradox (Apocrypha-Level)

### ✅ Canonical Statements

**Dual nature (BOTH true simultaneously):**

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **1. Parasitic (Self-Licking Wound)** | Counter-Rune averts collapse by feeding Blight with "living noise"; ensures sickness never ends; JORM signatures surge when Blight dips below threshold |
| **2. World-Ending (Mirror Key)** | Counter-Rune stabilizes reality ONLY by restoring Aesir perfection; full activation reinstalls pre-Glitch control logic with genocidal failsafes; "reformats" Aethelgard and wipes all life |

- **Mystery status:** Apocrypha-level (deliberately undefined resolution)
- **Foreshadowing permitted:** Field telemetry showing negative correlation, JORM_MODE flags, Tiwaz legal subroutines

### ❌ Forbidden Contradictions

- ❌ Counter-Rune as purely beneficial
- ❌ Counter-Rune as purely malevolent
- ❌ Resolution of paradox (must remain Apocrypha)
- ❌ Single-nature explanations

### 🔍 Migration Validation Questions

- 🔍 Does this page describe Counter-Rune mechanics?
- 🔍 Does it resolve the parasitic/world-ending paradox?
- 🔍 Does it contradict dual-nature canon?
