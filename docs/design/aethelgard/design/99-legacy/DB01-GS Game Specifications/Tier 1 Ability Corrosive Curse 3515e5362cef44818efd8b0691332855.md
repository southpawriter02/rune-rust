## Description

You whisper a sibilant curse in the corrupted tongue of the Blight, projecting rapid oxidation onto your target. Where your curse lands, metal begins to pit and flake, armor tarnishes, and structural integrity weakens. This is not natural corrosion measured in years—it is centuries of decay compressed into seconds.

## Mechanics

### Action Economy

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Action Cost** | Standard Action |
| **Resource Cost** | 25 Aether |
| **Targeting** | Single enemy (line of sight) |
| **Duration** | 3 turns |
| **Corruption Cost** | +1 Runic Blight Corruption |

### [Corroded] Status Effect

- Deals **1d6 Arcane damage** per turn per stack
- Reduces target's **Armor Value by 2** per stack
- Stacks up to **5 times** (can recast on same target)
- **Mechanical/Undying:** Take **double damage** (2d6 per stack)

### Maximum Stack Potential

| Stacks | Damage/Turn | Armor Reduction |
| --- | --- | --- |

| 3 | 3d6 (6d6 Mech) | -6 |
| 5 (Max) | 5d6 (10d6 Mech) | -10 |

## Tactical Applications

1. **Bread-and-Butter:** Your primary [Corroded] applicator—spam this
2. **Stacking Strategy:** Cast 3-5 times on priority targets for maximum effect
3. **Boss Shredding:** Against high-armor bosses, stack to completely neutralize defenses
4. **Aether Efficient:** Accelerated Entropy recovers +3 Aether per tick

---

## Integration Notes

- **Core Mechanic:** Your entire combat strategy revolves around applying and maintaining [Corroded] stacks
- **Synergy with Accelerated Entropy:** Each turn this ticks, you regain +3 Aether
- **Corruption Trade-Off:** Each cast corrupts you slightly—acceptable cost for single-target
