# Jötunheim — The Industrial Graveyard

> *"The Assembly-Deck was built to birth gods. It succeeded. And in the same breath, those gods tore each other apart in their cradle. We walk now through the aftermath of that divine tantrum—a continent of frozen screams, rusted bones, and the whisper of a million unfinished tasks. The machines here do not hate you. Hatred requires intent. They simply cannot stop. They will never stop. And when they find you, they will try to make you part of something that was never finished."*

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Realm Designation** | Realm 5 of 9 |
| **Deck Assignment** | Deck 05 |
| **Document ID** | AAM-GEO-JOTUNHEIM-BIOME-v1.0 |
| **Function** | Canonical geographic profile for Jötunheim biome; dungeon themes; hazard governance |
| **Layer Applicability** | All Layers (L1, L2, L3, L4) |
| **Status** | Canonical — Critical for salvage economy, Undying mechanics, industrial hazards |
| **Validation Requirement** | Mandatory for Jötunheim geography, Rust-Clan culture, Utgard governance, Jötun-Forged remnants |

Jötunheim represents the **industrial decay biome**—the graveyard of the Old World's greatest ambitions. These are the vast, silent factory floors, the colossal assembly yards, and the crumbling transport networks where the god-like Jötun-Forged were built, maintained, and ultimately destroyed.

The entire biome is built in, around, and through the **titanic corpses of dead metal giants**.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)

*"The Skalds sing of Jötunheim as the birthplace and graveyard of giants—the place where the Aesir built their greatest servants and where those servants tore themselves apart in a single night of divine madness. The god-machines were born screaming and died screaming, and their screams echo still in the rust-wind that howls across the Knuckle-Bone Fields. We who walk among their bones do not worship them. We feed on their corpses. We are the maggots of dead gods, and we are proud."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)

*"Jötunheim represents the industrial heartland of pre-Glitch civilization—Deck 05, the Grand Assembly Loom, dedicated to Jötun-Forged construction. The Ginnungagap Glitch triggered the Civil War of Glitches: newly-activated mechanoids turned on each other in automated frenzy, devastating the deck. Post-Glitch state comprises four biomes: Knuckle-Bone Fields (8-15m deep Adamant-Weave ossuary), Ginnungagap Coolant Chasm (continent-spanning toxic drainage), Ash-Blown Wastes (20-40 km/h metal particulate winds), and nine surviving Great Looms (200-400m assembly complexes). Utgard (10,000+ population) serves as lawless capital. Salvage reserves estimated at 50-80 years; 15% of Dvergr raw material input originates here."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)

*"REALM: Jötunheim. DECK: 05. PURPOSE: Grand Assembly Loom (Jötun-Forged construction). STATUS: Industrial graveyard; salvage economy; Undying-dominant. POPULATION: 10,000+ (Utgard); thousands transient. BIOMES: Knuckle-Bone Fields (ossuary, 8-15m debris), Ginnungagap Coolant Chasm (chemical hazard, 2mm/hour steel penetration), Ash-Blown Wastes (20-40 km/h particulate), Great Looms (nine Urðr-Class complexes, 200-400m). HAZARDS: Type Beta CPS (10min onset), Scream of Steel (Type Alpha Psychic), Live Power Conduit (signature), toxic atmosphere. RESERVES: 50-80 years. DVERGR INPUT: 15%. DOMINANT HOSTILES: Rusted Servitor (common), Assembly-Line Golem (high), Gantry-Gargoyle (200+ Loom-09), Forlorn-Piloted Frame (extreme). FAUNA: Svin-fylking (Iron-Husked Boar)."*

### Layer 4 (Omniscient Ground Truth)

*Jötunheim is the "industrial decay" biome—the mid-game combat and exploration challenge representing the graveyard of the Old World's greatest ambitions. The realm provides thematic contrast to Midgard's tamed ruin: where Midgard shows nature reclaiming civilization, Jötunheim shows civilization frozen at the moment of catastrophic self-destruction. The primary threat is the relentless, paradoxical logic of the Undying and the sheer scale of decaying industrial hardware. The Rust-Clans represent a unique post-apocalyptic adaptation: not survivors clinging to the past, but a culture that has made the machine-corpse environment home. Utgard demonstrates emergent social order through contract sanctity rather than traditional governance. The salvage economy establishes resource scarcity and drives inter-realm trade dynamics.*

## Summary

Jötunheim answers the question: **What happens when the gods kill each other in their cra
