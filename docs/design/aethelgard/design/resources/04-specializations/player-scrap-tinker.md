# The Scrap-Tinker — The Architect of a Broken World

> *"You see junk. I see three flash bombs, a shock mine, and enough parts to get that drone flying again. The old world is dead—but it left us the pieces. Every bolt, every wire, every corroded gear is a gift from the past. Our job isn't to mourn what was lost. Our job is to rebuild. Piece by piece. Bodge by bodge. Until we've built something that works again. The Blight didn't kill technology—it just broke it. And broken things? Broken things are what I do."*
> — Artificer Björn One-Eye, Master Scrap-Tinker, Utgard Salvage Collective

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Adept |
| **Role** | Master Crafter, Gadgeteer, Pet Controller |
| **Path Type** | Coherent |
| **Primary Attribute** | WITS |
| **Secondary Attribute** | FINESSE |
| **Resource System** | Stamina + Scrap Materials |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | None (Corruption risk from Blighted salvage) |
| **Unlock Cost** | 3 PP |

The **Scrap-Tinker** is the Adept specialization that embodies the philosophy that a **functional future can be reverse-engineered and built from the wreckage of the past**.

They are not mystics who tamper with the world's code. They are not warriors who face the darkness with steel. They are **practical, brilliant engineers** who see the ruins not as a graveyard, but as a treasure trove of broken hardware and reusable components.

To choose the Scrap-Tinker is to embrace the fantasy of the **master artificer and resourceful inventor**. Your saga is written in the elegant schematics you discover, the powerful gadgets you craft, and the masterwork gear you fabricate. You are the one who brings the light of logic and function back to a world of decay, proving that even from the most corrupted scrap, a coherent and powerful machine can be built.

They are the obsessive architects of survival, believing that the future will be built, piece by piece, from the scraps of a failed reality. Their saga is a meticulous schematic of salvaged hope, a story of imposing logical function onto the chaotic, corrupted detritus of a dead world.

## Core Philosophy: The Engineer of a Crashed System

### The Three Pillars

| Pillar | Mechanic | Fantasy |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Reverse-Engineering & Salvage** | Master Scavenger, Salvage Expertise, Automated Scavenging | See treasure in trash; harvest the old world |
| **Gadget Deployment** | Flash Bomb, Shock Mine, Scout Drone | Toolkit of a broken world; control the battlefield |
| **System Sabotage & Construction** | Weapon Modification, Scrap Golem | Build the future from the wreckage |

The Scrap-Tinker's power comes from a philosophy of **pragmatic reclamation**. In the Age of Echoes, the old world's technology lies scattered everywhere—broken, corrupted, but not entirely dead. The Scrap-Tinker understands that within every derelict machine is a component waiting to be salvaged, within every ruin is a schematic waiting to be reverse-engineered.

They do not fear the Blight's corruption. They have learned to work around it, to extract the useful parts while minimizing exposure. They have developed techniques for creating stable devices from unstable components.

> *"The Blight didn't kill technology—it just corrupted it. And broken things? Broken things are what I do."*

### The Coherent Adept (Zero Trauma Risk)

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Coherent (no Corruption mechanics in abilities) |
| **Risk Level** | None (safest Adept specialization) |
| **Power Source** | Engineering knowledge, salvaged components, WITS |
| **Trade-off** | Preparation-heavy; requires downtime and resources |

The Scrap-Tinker is a **Coherent specialization**—the safest in the Trauma Economy. They have no self-harm mechanics, no Corruption costs, no deliberate interface with the Blight's chaos.

However, they have a **unique indirect risk**. Their constant, hands-on work with [Blighted] salvage carries a chance of inflicting Runic Blight Corruption on a failed check. Salvaging corrupted components means exposure to the raw, paradoxical code within. The Field Scavenge passive mitigates this risk, but it never disappears entirely.

Their WITS as primary attribute makes them excellent at analysis, crafting, and understanding complex schematics. Their FINESSE as secondary gives them the delicate touch required for precision repairs and trap disarming.

> *"Their core non-combat role. They excel at the Tinkering craft, but with a new risk: salvaging [Blighted] components from fallen machines carries a chance of inflicting Runic Blight Corruption on a failed check, representing exposure to the raw, paradoxical code within."*

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Scavenger-engineer who sees treasure in ruins; master artificer |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Preparatory utility with battlefield control and pet deployment |
| **Success Metric** | Party has best gear; enemies are controlled; drones and golems do your bidding |
| **Decision Space** | "What should I craft? Where should I place the trap? What does my golem do this turn?" |

Playing a Scrap-Tinker is about **preparation and resource management**.

Your gameplay loop:
- **Salvage**: Collect Scrap Materials from defeated enemies and containers
- **Craft**: Create gadgets, weapon modifications, and deployables at workbenches
- **Deploy**: Place traps, launch drones, and unleash your Scrap Golem in combat
- **Control**: Use your gadgets and pets to disrupt enemies and support allies
- **Modify**: Permanently enhance ally weapons with elemental damage, precision bonuses, and reinforcement

You are the **engine of the party's gear progression**. Your Salvage Expertise creates [Masterwork] and [Prototype] quality items. Your Weapon Modification permanently enhances ally weapons. Your gadgets provide crowd control, reconnaissance, and tactical options no other specialization can match.

**The Trade-Off**: Your power is almost entirely proactive. You must craft before expeditions. You must prepare before combat. In the middle of a fight with no gadgets, no Scrap, and no deployed pets, you contribute almost nothing directly. Your combat role is back-row support and control—you cannot tank, you cannot deal sustained damage, you cannot heal.

> *"The Scrap-Tinker is a preparatory and utility-focused class. Their power is almost entirely proactive, determined by the quality and variety of the gear and gadgets they craft before an expedition."*

## Core Mechanics

### Scrap Materials Economy

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Secondary resource for crafting and deployment |
| **Sources** | Defeated mechanical enemies, loot containers, salvaging equipment |
| **Scaling** | Master Scavenger increases yield by 50-100% |

The **Scrap Materials** economy is the Scrap-Tinker's unique resource system. Unlike other Adepts who operate purely on Stamina, the Scrap-Tinker must collect and manage a physical inventory of components.

| Source | Scrap Gained |
|--------|--------------|
| Defeated Mechanical Enemies | +50-100% (by rank) |
| Loot Containers | +50-100% (by rank) |
| Salvaging Broken Equipment | Variable |
| Automated Scavenging (post-combat) | 5-15 (by rank) |
| Scout Drone Scavenging | +5 per combat |
| Scrap Golem Scavenging | +10 per combat |
| Expedition Start (Rank 3) | 20 Scrap |

| Gadget | Base Cost | With Efficient Assembly |
|--------|-----------|------------------------|
| Flash Bomb | Standard | Reduced |
| Shock Mine | Standard | Reduced |
| Scout Drone | 15 Scrap | 8-15 Scrap |
| Weapon Modification | 20-25 Scrap | 10-18 Scrap |
| Scrap Golem | 50 Scrap | 25-50 Scrap |

This creates a distinctive resource management game. The Scrap-Tinker must balance immediate needs (gadgets for this fight) against long-term investments (weapon modifications, Scrap Golem).

> *"Scrap Materials are the secondary resource for the Scrap-Tinker. Collect and spend Scrap Materials to craft gadgets and deployables."*

### Crafting Quality Tiers

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Crafted items have quality levels affecting power |
| **Tiers** | Standard → Masterwork → Prototype |
| **Scaling** | Salvage Expertise increases Masterwork/Prototype chance |

The **Crafting Quality** system determines how powerful your creations are.

| Quality | Effect Bonus | Chance (by rank) |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| **Standard** | Base effects | Default |
| **Masterwork** | Enhanced effects | 15% → 25% → 40% |
| **Prototype** | Superior effects (Rank 3 only) | 0% → 0% → 10% |

A [Masterwork Flash Bomb] deals additional damage. A [Masterwork Shock Mine] applies [Slowed] after the Stun ends. A [Prototype] weapon modification has doubled bonuses.

This creates a gambling element to crafting—sometimes you create something extraordinary, and the Scrap-Tinker's passives stack the odds in your favor.

> *"Crafted gadgets have 15% → 25% → 40% chance to be [Masterwork] (enhanced effects). At Rank 3, can craft [Prototype] quality (10% chance, superior to Masterwork)."*

### Gadget Deployment

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Pre-crafted consumables for battlefield control |
| **Types** | Flash Bombs (AoE blind), Shock Mines (trap damage + stun) |
| **Scaling** | Ranks increase damage, duration, save DCs, and add effects |

The **Gadget Deployment** mechanic is the Scrap-Tinker's primary combat function. They use pre-crafted and improvised devices to control the flow of battle.

| Gadget | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Flash Bomb** | AoE [Blinded] for 2-3 turns; Rank 2+ adds -2 Defense; Masterwork adds 2d6 damage |
| **Shock Mine** | Hidden trap; 4d8-5d8 Lightning damage; [Stunned] 2 turns; Masterwork adds [Slowed] |

A "Flash Bomb" is re-contextualized as a sensory overload of corrupted data. A "Shock Mine" is a focused electrical trap that fries nervous systems and mechanical circuitry alike.

> *"They use pre-crafted and improvised gadgets to control the flow of battle. A 'Flash Bomb' is re-contextualized as a sensory overload of corrupted data."*

### Pet/Minion Control

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Deployable allies that act on your command |
| **Types** | Scout Drone (reconnaissance), Scrap Golem (combat) |
| **Control** | Act on your turn; respond to commands |

The **Pet/Minion Control** mechanic is the Scrap-Tinker's unique combat identity. They are the only Adept who can deploy autonomous allies.

| Pet | Stats | Abilities |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| **Scout Drone** | 15-20 HP, 2-4 Armor | Vision (7x7-10x10), Mark Target (+1 ally hit), Self-Destruct (4d6 AoE) |
| **Scrap Golem** | 40-80 HP, 6-10 Armor, Psychic Immune | Slam (3d10-5d10), Defend (+3 Soak to ally), Repair (20 HP 1x/combat), Detonate (8d10 AoE) |

The Scout Drone provides reconnaissance—revealing hidden enemies and traps, marking priority targets, and scouting ahead. The Scrap Golem is your masterpiece—a walking junk pile animated by salvaged power cores, loyal and brutal.

> *"Your masterpiece. A walking junk pile animated by salvaged power cores. Loyal. Brutal. Yours."*

| **Salvage Expertise** | Passive | — | +1d10-3d10 to Engineering crafting; 15-40% Masterwork chance; Rank 2: 25% faster crafting; Rank 3: 10% Prototype chance |

**Master Scavenger** is your foundational resource generation. You see value where others see junk. Every bolt, every wire, every corroded gear—repurposable. Your trained eye spots intact components instantly, and you know how to extract them without triggering dangerous discharges.

> *"You see value where others see junk. Every bolt, every wire, every corroded gear—repurposable."*

**Deploy Flash Bomb** is your foundational crowd control. You lob the improvised device and watch enemies' optics overload, their eyes burn. The [Blinded] status cripples attack accuracy and prevents abilities requiring sight—devastating against ranged enemies and casters.

**Salvage Expertise** is your foundational crafting bonus. Your understanding of pre-Glitch engineering is encyclopedic. Your work is precise, efficient, masterful. Every check is more likely to succeed, and every success has a chance to produce something exceptional.

### Tier 2 — Advanced Artifice

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Deploy Scout Drone** | Active | 40 Stamina + 15 Scrap | Deploy reconnaissance drone (15-20 HP, 2-4 Armor); 7x7-10x10 vision; reveals hidden enemies/traps; Mark Target (+1 ally hit); Rank 3: Self-Destruct (4d6 AoE) |
| **Deploy Shock Mine** | Active | 35 Stamina | Place hidden trap; 4d8-5d8 Lightning damage on trigger; STURDINESS DC 16-18 or [Stunned] 2 turns; max 2/combat; Masterwork: [Slowed] after Stun |

**Deploy Scout Drone** is your reconnaissance tool. The jerry-rigged drone buzzes to life. Its optics scan the battlefield, feeding you tactical data. It reveals hidden enemies, spots traps, and marks priority targets for your allies. At Rank 3, you can command it to self-destruct for massive AoE damage—a final, explosive contribution.

> *"The jerry-rigged drone buzzes to life. Its optics scan the battlefield, feeding you tactical data."*

**Deploy Shock Mine** is your trap-based control. You carefully arm the mine. Step on it—instant overload. Nervous system fried. Hidden from enemies until triggered, the Shock Mine combines significant Lightning damage with the devastating [Stunned] status. Two per combat means you can lock down choke points or create kill zones.

**Weapon Modification** is your force multiplier. You disassemble the weapon, integrate salvaged components, reassemble. Better than factory spec. This is permanent enhancement to ally weapons—not a buff, but a lasting upgrade. At Rank 3, you can stack two modifications on the same weapon for devastating combinations.

> *"You disassemble the weapon, integrate salvaged components, reassemble. Better than factory spec."*

### Tier 3 — Mastery of the Cog

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Automated Scavenging** | Passive | — | After combat: auto-collect 10-15 Scrap; Scout Drone active: +5 Scrap; Scrap Golem active: +10 Scrap; Rank 3: 25% rare components |
| **Efficient Assembly** | Passive | — | All gadget crafting costs 40-50% less Scrap; 75% faster crafting; can craft 2-3 gadgets simultaneously; Rank 3: Flash Bombs and Repair Kits instant |

**Automated Scavenging** is your economic engine. You've built automated collection systems. Magnets, sensors, retrieval claws—never leave materials behind. After every combat, Scrap flows into your inventory without lifting a finger. Your pets contribute too—the Scout Drone and Scrap Golem actively scavenge while deployed.

> *"You've built automated collection systems. Magnets, sensors, retrieval claws—never leave materials behind."*

**Efficient Assembly** is your production optimization. Muscle memory. Optimized workflows. You assemble gadgets faster than most people load a gun. Costs are slashed, time is compressed, and you can work on multiple projects simultaneously. At Rank 3, some gadgets become instant—you can create a Flash Bomb in the heat of battle.

### Capstone — Deploy Scrap Golem

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Prerequisite** | 24 PP invested + both Tier 3 abilities |
| **Type** | Active (once per expedition) |
| **Cost** | 50 Stamina + 50 Scrap Materials + 1 hour assembly |
| **Duration** | Until destroyed or expedition ends |
| **Effect** | Deploy Scrap Golem (40-80 HP, 6-10 Armor, Psychic Immune); Slam (3d10-5d10 Physical), Defend (+3 Soak to ally), Repair (20 HP 1x/combat), Detonate (8d10 AoE) |

The capstone **Deploy Scrap Golem** is your masterpiece—the ultimate expression of the Scrap-Tinker's art.

A walking junk pile animated by salvaged power cores. A custom-built, autonomous combat companion. Loyal. Brutal. Yours.

> *"Your masterpiece. A walking junk pile animated by salvaged power cores. Loyal. Brutal. Yours."*

**The Golem's Capabilities**:
- **Slam**: 3d10-5d10 Physical damage—pure melee destruction
- **Defend**: Grant an adjacent ally +3 Soak—mobile protection
- **Repair Protocol** (Rank 2): Self-heal 20 HP once per combat—sustainability
- **Detonate** (Rank 3): Command self-destruct for 8d10 damage in a 5x5 AoE—nuclear option

**The Golem's Identity**:
- Immune to Psychic effects—the Blight cannot touch its mind because it has no mind
- Persists until destroyed or expedition ends—not a temporary summon, but a lasting companion
- Can carry 50 extra Scrap capacity (Rank 2)—mobile storage
- Can be rebuilt for half cost (Rank 3)—even destruction isn't permanent

This is the Scrap-Tinker's ultimate fantasy: to create life—or at least a functional approximation of it—from junk and determination.

> *"The Scrap-Tinker deploys their masterpiece: a custom-built, autonomous support drone, a testament to logical creation in a world of corrupted chaos."*

## Systemic Integration

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Source | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Salvaging [Blighted] Components** | Chance of Corruption on failed check |
| **Reactivate Automaton** (if available) | Psychic Stress from corrupted OS interface |
| **Field Scavenge Passive** | Reduces Corruption risk from salvage |
| **Optimized Workflow Passive** | Reduces [Glitched] property chance |

The Scrap-Tinker has a **unique indirect relationship** with the Trauma Economy. Their abilities don't inflict Stress or Corruption directly—but their work brings them into constant contact with corrupted technology.

Every salvage attempt on [Blighted] components carries risk. Every deconstructed machine might discharge paradoxical code. The Field Scavenge and Optimized Workflow passives mitigate this risk, but it never disappears entirely.

This creates a distinctive risk/reward calculation: the most valuable salvage often comes from the most corrupted sources.

### Mitigation Tools

| Tool | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Field Scavenge** | Reduces Corruption chance when salvaging |
| **Optimized Workflow** | Reduces [Glitched] property chance on crafted items |
| **Scout Drone** | Reveals hazards before exposure |
| **Scrap Golem** | Immune to Psychic effects; can handle dangerous materials |

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Warriors (all)** | Weapon Modification enhances their damage output |
| **Skirmishers (all)** | Precision mods benefit hit-focused builds |
| **Bone-Setter** | Combined support excellence; Tinker handles gear, Bone-Setter handles bodies |
| **Jötun-Reader** | Analyze Mechanism + Jötun-Reader analysis = complete enemy intel |
| **Iron-Bane** | Combined anti-Undying specialization; devastating vs. mechanical enemies |
| **Kaupmaðr** | Economic synergy; Kaupmaðr funds materials, Tinker crafts |

> *"The Scrap-Tinker is the absolute engine of the party's technological gear progression. They are the primary source of [Optimized] gear, powerful [Mods], and a vast arsenal of tactical gadgets."*

### Optimal Conditions

| Situation | Advantage |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Preparation Time** | Downtime to craft gadgets and modifications |
| **Mechanical Enemies** | Bonus Scrap from Undying/constructs; Analyze Mechanism reveals weaknesses |
| **Hardware Puzzles** | Expert at repairing machines, rerouting power, understanding mechanisms |
| **Long Expeditions** | Economic advantages compound; Scrap Golem persists |
| **Urban/Industrial Ruins** | Maximum salvage opportunities |

### Weakness Conditions

| Situation | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| **No Preparation** | Limited gadgets means limited contribution |
| **Resource-Starved** | No Scrap means no crafting |
| **Organic Enemies** | Less Scrap from beasts; Analyze Mechanism less useful |
| **Direct Combat** | Cannot tank, cannot deal sustained damage |
| **Short Encounters** | Not enough time for pets and traps to generate value |

## Lore Integration

### Historical Development

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| **Pre-Glitch** | Engineering was a formal discipline within the Aesir hierarchy |
| **Post-Glitch Chaos** | Survivors learned to salvage from necessity |
| **First Tinkerers** | Rust-Clan Artificers who discovered Scrap-Runes by accident |
| **Formalization** | Tinkering became a recognized craft with codified techniques |
| **Modern Practice** | Scrap-Tinker as specialization with systematic approach to salvage and construction |

The Scrap-Tinker tradition emerged from the Rust-Clans of Jötunheim—the scavenger communities who made their lives amid the wreckage of the Jötun-Forged factories. They were the first to realize that the old world's technology wasn't entirely dead, just broken.

The first Scrap-Rune was an accident. An Artificer, attempting to replicate the strengthening runes they had seen on Jötun-Forged armor, crudely scratched a similar shape onto a mundane piece of steel. Nothing happened. But when they tried again on a fragment of a Vörðr-drone's capacitor, the rune flared with a brief, violent spark of static electricity.

The discovery was made: the magic was not just in the shape, but in the memory of the metal itself.

### The Art of the Bodge

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **See Value in Junk** | Every component has potential use |
| **Work Around the Blight** | Minimize corruption exposure; maximize yield |
| **Function Over Form** | A bodge that works is better than elegance that fails |
| **Iterate and Improve** | Every prototype leads to a better design |
| **Share the Knowledge** | Schematics belong to everyone who can use them |

The Scrap-Tinker operates by the philosophy of the bodge—the improvised repair, the makeshift solution, the "good enough" fix that keeps the machinery running for one more day.

> *"A Bodge-job. Making it work with what you have."*

This is not laziness. It is pragmatism. In a world where perfect materials don't exist and corruption lurks in every component, the ability to create function from dysfunction is the highest art.

### Instruments and Kit

| Instrument | Function |
|------------|----------|
| **Salvage Tools** | Pry bars, cutters, extractors for component removal |
| **Workbench** | Portable or fixed station for crafting |
| **Component Pouches** | Organized storage for Scrap Materials |
| **Schematics** | Blueprints for gadgets and modifications |
| **Diagnostic Equipment** | Tools for analyzing mechanisms and detecting corruption |
| **Power Cells** | Energy sources for drones and golems |

| Gadget Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Flash Bomb** | Sensory overload device; blinds organic and optical sensors |
| **Shock Mine** | Electrical trap; damages and stuns on contact |
| **Scout Drone** | Reconnaissance automaton with vision and marking capabilities |
| **Weapon Mods** | Permanent enhancements: elemental damage, precision, reinforcement |
| **Scrap Golem** | Combat automaton built from salvaged components |

### Factional Relationships

| Faction | Relationship |
|---------|--------------|
| **Rust-Clans** | Natural home; Scrap-Tinkers are respected Artificers |
| **Dvergr** | Complicated; Dvergr disdain "bodged craftsmanship" but respect results |
| **Jötun-Readers** | Valued partners; Readers provide schematics, Tinkers build from them |
| **Iron-Banes** | Wary alliance; Tinkers are useful against Undying but "too close to the machines" |
| **Rangers Guild** | Trade partners; Tinkers maintain trail equipment |
| **God-Sleepers** | Distrusted; Tinkers see machines as tools, not gods |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic/Survivor)
*"In the tales, they are the ones who can make anything work. They walk into a ruin and walk out with a pocket full of treasure—treasure that looks like junk to everyone else. They can fix a broken blade with wire and spit. They can build a fire-starter from a dead servitor's spark-plug. They can cobble together a walking monster from the bodies of the machines we've killed. The Rust-Clans call them Artificers—the ones who see the old world not as a curse, but as a gift. 'Every bolt is a blessing,' they say. 'Every wire is a prayer.' When the machines rise against you, you want a Tinker at your back. When the road is blocked by broken technology, you want a Tinker at the front. When your blade is notched and your armor is cracked, you want a Tinker in your camp. They don't fight the darkness with swords. They build the light."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)

## Summary

The Scrap-Tinker is the **master artificer** of Aethelgard.

Where other Adepts heal bodies (Bone-Setter), analyze systems (Jötun-Reader), or broker deals (Kaupmaðr), the Scrap-Tinker builds the future from the wreckage of the past. They are the engine of the party's gear progression, the source of crowd-controlling gadgets, and the commander of autonomous mechanical allies.

Their power is unique. They operate on a dual resource system—Stamina and Scrap Materials—that creates a distinctive economic game within the larger adventure. They are the only Adept with pet companions, and their Scrap Golem is one of the most powerful allies in the game. Their Weapon Modifications are permanent enhancements that compound the party's effectiveness over time.

Their gameplay is preparatory. Before expeditions, they craft. Before combat, they deploy traps. During combat, they command pets and throw gadgets. After combat, they salvage. This loop creates a deeply engaging rhythm of resource management and tactical decision-making.

But their direct combat contribution is limited. Without preparation, without Scrap, without deployed pets—they are nearly helpless. They cannot tank, they cannot deal sustained damage, they cannot heal. Their value is in what they've built, not what they can do in the moment.

They are the architects of a broken world.
They see treasure where others see trash.
They build the future piece by piece, bodge by bodge.
Until they've built something that works again.

*You see junk.*
*I see three flash bombs, a shock mine, and enough parts to get that drone flying again.*
*The Blight didn't kill technology—it just broke it.*
*And broken things?*
*Broken things are what I do.*
