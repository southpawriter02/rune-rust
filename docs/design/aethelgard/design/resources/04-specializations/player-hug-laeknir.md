# The Hug-læknir — The Debugger of a Corrupted Mind

> *"The wound you cannot see is the wound that kills. When the Scream gets inside, it doesn't just hurt—it rewrites. It makes you believe you were always broken, that the static is the truth. That's when you need someone who can show you the shape of your own story before the noise took it. Someone who can remind you what coherence felt like. I've talked thirty-seven souls back from the edge. Thirty-seven minds that would have shattered into permanent, gibbering ruin. I've taken a piece of each of them into myself. The Scream is louder in my head than it is in yours—but I know where I end and it begins. That's the art. That's the discipline. That's the only thing that matters."*

The **Hug-læknir** (Mind-Healer) is a new kind of healer for a new kind of wound.

In a world saturated by the eternal psychic scream of the Runic Blight, the Hug-læknir understands a chilling truth: **the wounds of the soul are as real and as deadly as the wounds of the flesh**. They are not mystics. They are not priests. They are **proto-psychologists**—non-magical scholars of a new and terrifying science. Their art is a deep, clinical understanding of how a coherent mind fractures under the strain of a paradoxical reality.

Their philosophy is one of **narrative re-compilation**. They fight the Blight not with steel or spells, but with logic, empathy, and specialized techniques designed to help a mind "reboot" its own coherent story. They are the indispensable therapists of the Age of Echoes, their sagas written not in heroic deeds, but in the quiet, vital moments of talking a comrade back from the brink of a total system crash.

To choose the Hug-læknir is to embrace the fantasy of the **selfless healer of minds**. You are the party's anchor of sanity. You make it possible for others to brave the deepest, most mind-shattering ruins and emerge with their coherence intact. Your direct combat contribution is almost zero, but your impact on the party's longevity is immeasurable.

## Core Philosophy: The Therapist of a Broken World

### The Three Pillars

| Pillar | Mechanic | Fantasy |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Psychic Triage** | Psychic Triage, Shared Saga | Remove accumulated Stress; "heal" the mind |
| **Cognitive Fortification** | Logical Framework, Fortress of the Mind | Proactively shield minds against incoming Stress |
| **Narrative Re-compilation** | Soothing Word, Moment of Lucidity | "Debug" a mind that is actively glitching |

The Hug-læknir's power comes from a philosophy of **coherence as health**. In the Age of Echoes, the Runic Blight doesn't just threaten bodies—it attacks minds. The eternal psychic static of the Cursed Choir (the Blight's "scream") erodes sanity, induces panic, and ultimately shatters coherent thought into permanent, irreversible Trauma.

The Hug-læknir is the answer.

They understand that a coherent mind is a mind with a **stable internal narrative**—a clear sense of self, of cause and effect, of past and future. The Blight attacks this narrative, injecting paradox, contradiction, and anti-logic. The Hug-læknir's art is to help a mind **re-compile** its story, to find the thread of coherence amid the static and hold on.

> *"Observe, fortify, then relieve. Logic and empathy are the tools; coherence is the goal."*

### The Coherent Adept (Moderate Risk)

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Coherent (no deliberate Corruption mechanics) |
| **Risk Level** | Moderate (unique self-harm through empathic burden) |
| **Power Source** | Clinical knowledge, empathy, and psychological technique |
| **Trade-off** | Zero direct combat contribution |

The Hug-læknir is a **Coherent specialization**—they do not deliberately interface with the Blight's chaos or accumulate Corruption through normal use of their abilities. Their power comes from skill, knowledge, and force of personality.

However, they have a **unique risk profile**. The Empathic Burden passive means that every time they heal an ally's Stress, they absorb a portion of it themselves. And their capstone, Moment of Lucidity, requires them to take a massive amount of irresistible Psychic Stress *and* gain 1 Corruption when they use it.

This creates a distinctive gameplay loop: the Hug-læknir is constantly managing their *own* Stress while managing the party's. They cannot heal indefinitely—eventually, the accumulated trauma of their patients threatens to break them too.

> *"To heal a mind is to take on a piece of its pain. The Hug-læknir learns to process this transferred trauma, turning it into a deeper understanding of their craft."*

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Selfless healer of minds; the anchor who keeps the party sane |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Methodical support with high-stakes crisis intervention |
| **Success Metric** | Party survives without permanent Traumas; high-Stress characters kept functional |
| **Decision Space** | "Who needs stabilization? When do I fortify vs. triage? Is this worth my own sanity?" |

Playing a Hug-læknir is about **managing the invisible damage**.

Your gameplay loop:
- **Observe**: Use Assess Psyche to understand vulnerabilities and WILL scores
- **Fortify**: Apply Logical Framework before major threats to reduce incoming Stress
- **Triage**: Use Psychic Triage and Shared Saga to remove accumulated Stress
- **Stabilize**: Remove [Feared] and [Disoriented] with Soothing Word
- **Sacrifice**: In the ultimate crisis, use Moment of Lucidity to prevent a permanent Trauma—at enormous personal cost

You are the **sanity healer** in a game where sanity matters as much as hit points. The Trauma Economy is a parallel damage track that threatens permanent, character-defining penalties. You are the only specialization dedicated entirely to managing it.

**The Trade-Off**: You have no direct offensive or defensive capabilities. You cannot deal damage. You cannot tank. You cannot even heal HP—that's the Bone-Setter's domain. Your entire kit is focused on Psychic Stress, which means in fights against mindless beasts that inflict little psychological damage, you contribute almost nothing.

> *"The Hug-læknir is a pure, dedicated support class whose 'healing' targets the Psychic Stress meter. Their direct combat contribution is almost zero, but their impact on the party's longevity is immeasurable."*

## Core Mechanics

### Psychic Triage

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Remove accumulated Psychic Stress from allies |
| **Type** | "Healing" for the sanity damage track |
| **Scaling** | Improved by Trained Empathy (+1 Stress removed) |

The **Psychic Triage** mechanic is the Hug-læknir's bread-and-butter. They are the premier, non-consumable source of Psychic Stress removal in the game.

| Ability | Scope | Effect |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Psychic Triage** | Single target | Remove moderate Stress |
| **Shared Saga** | All allies | Remove moderate Stress from entire party |

The Hug-læknir engages an ally in a calming, structured conversation—grounding techniques, breathing exercises, simple logical frameworks. They pull the mind back from the edge of the psychic static. They help the ally remember who they are.

> *"Psychic Triage: The Hug-læknir engages an ally in a calming, structured conversation, using grounding techniques to pull their mind back from the brink of the psychic static."*

### Cognitive Fortification

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Proactively shield minds against incoming Stress |
| **Type** | Buff that grants Stress resistance |
| **Duration** | 3 rounds (Logical Framework) |

The **Cognitive Fortification** mechanic represents the Hug-læknir's ability to prepare minds for trauma *before* it happens.

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Logical Framework** | +2 dice to Resolve Checks vs. Stress for 3 rounds |
| **Fortress of the Mind (T3)** | Logical Framework also grants [Fear] immunity |

The Hug-læknir provides an ally with a simple, powerful logical mantra or mental exercise to focus on—a "firewall" against the world's anti-logic. When the Scream comes, the ally has something coherent to hold onto.

> *"The Hug-læknir does not grant magical protection; they construct a mental firewall."*

### Narrative Re-compilation

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Remove debilitating mental status effects |
| **Type** | Condition removal (debugging) |
| **Targets** | [Feared], [Disoriented], and ultimately [Trauma] |

The **Narrative Re-compilation** mechanic represents the Hug-læknir's ability to "debug" a mind that is actively glitching—to break through the confusion and terror and restore a coherent internal story.

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Soothing Word** | Remove [Feared] or [Disoriented] from single ally |
| **Moment of Lucidity** | Prevent permanent [Trauma] at enormous cost |

With a calm, perfectly modulated word of reassurance, the Hug-læknir breaks through an ally's panic or confusion. They re-establish the coherent narrative. They remind the ally that the static is not the truth—that there was a "before," and there can be an "after."

> *"The Hug-læknir is not casting a magical dispelling; they are performing a narrative reboot."*

### Empathic Burden

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Transfers some of patient's Stress to healer |
| **Type** | Passive risk/reward mechanic |
| **Effect** | Gain ~20% of Stress removed; reduce next ability's Stamina cost |

The **Empathic Burden** mechanic is the Hug-læknir's unique risk profile. Every time they successfully remove Psychic Stress from an ally, they absorb a portion of that trauma into themselves.

This creates a critical resource management challenge. The Hug-læknir cannot heal indefinitely—their own sanity is slowly eroded by their work. They must balance their party's needs against their own mental health.

The trade-off: when they absorb trauma, they gain the [Empathetic Insight] status, which reduces the Stamina cost of their next Mind-Healer ability by 50%. The burden deepens their understanding.

> *"To heal a mind is to take on a piece of its pain."*

## Abilities: The Mind-Healer's Tree

### Tier 1 — Foundational Empathy

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Trained Empathy** | Passive | — | +1d10 to all WILL-based Resolve Checks against Psychic Stress; Psychic Triage removes +1 extra Stress |
| **Psychic Triage** | Active | 40 Stamina | Remove moderate Psychic Stress from single ally; enhanced by Trained Empathy |
| **Assess Psyche** | Active | 30 Stamina | WITS-based analysis of target; reveals WILL score and vulnerabilities to mental effects (e.g., "Vulnerable to Fear") |

**Trained Empathy** is your foundational discipline. The Hug-læknir's training begins with learning to fortify their own mind—the better to understand and endure the trauma of others. This is not a soft, innate kindness, but a rigorous, learned discipline.

> *"The first and most critical lesson of a mind-healer: to heal the trauma of others, one must first be a fortress against it."*

**Psychic Triage** is your bread-and-butter healing ability. You engage an ally in a calming, structured conversation. You use grounding techniques—"Name five things you can see. Four things you can touch."—to pull their mind back from the brink of the psychic static. The amount of Stress removed is determined by your clinical expertise, not by mystical power.

**Assess Psyche** is your diagnostic tool. You carefully observe a target, analyzing their tics, their posture, and the subtle tells of their mental state. You gauge their willpower and identify their psychological vulnerabilities. On enemies, this reveals WILL scores and mental weaknesses. On allies, it helps you prioritize treatment.

### Tier 2 — Advanced Counseling

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Logical Framework** | Active | 45 Stamina | Apply buff to single ally: +2 dice to all Resolve Checks vs. Psychic Stress for 3 rounds |
| **Soothing Word** | Active | 35 Stamina | Instantly remove [Feared] or [Disoriented] from single ally |
| **Empathic Burden** | Passive | — | When removing Stress from ally, Hug-læknir gains ~20% of Stress removed; next Mind-Healer ability costs 50% less Stamina |

**Logical Framework** is your proactive fortification tool. You provide an ally with a simple, powerful logical mantra or mental exercise to focus on—a temporary "firewall" against the world's anti-logic. "When the Scream comes, count to seven. Focus on the counting. Seven is real. Seven was real before the Glitch. Seven will be real after."

> *"The Hug-læknir provides an ally with a simple, powerful logical mantra or mental exercise to focus on, creating a temporary 'firewall' against the world's anti-logic."*

**Soothing Word** is your emergency condition removal. With a calm, perfectly modulated word of reassurance, you break through an ally's panic or confusion, re-establishing a coherent narrative in their mind. The specific word varies—sometimes it's a name, sometimes it's a shared memory, sometimes it's a simple truth like "You are still here."

**Empathic Burden** is your unique passive risk. Every time you heal, you take on a piece of the patient's pain. The Stress you absorb is real—it counts against your own sanity meter. But the experience deepens your understanding, reducing the Stamina cost of your next ability. This creates a resource management loop: heal → absorb burden → cheaper next heal → heal again → absorb more burden...

### Tier 3 — Mastery of Coherence

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Shared Saga** | Active | 60 Stamina | Remove moderate Psychic Stress from ALL allies |
| **Fortress of the Mind** | Passive | — | Logical Framework now also grants temporary immunity to [Fear]; Hug-læknir is permanently Resistant to [Disoriented] |

**Shared Saga** is your area-of-effect healing. You begin recounting a simple, heroic tale of camaraderie and perseverance. The coherent, hopeful narrative is a powerful anchor that calms the frayed nerves of the entire party. This is not a magical wave of peace—it is the act of creating a coherent chorus, a shared story that drowns out the static.

> *"The Hug-læknir begins recounting a simple, heroic tale of camaraderie and perseverance. The coherent, hopeful narrative is a powerful anchor that calms the frayed nerves of the entire party."*

**Fortress of the Mind** represents your mastery. Your own mind has become an unbreakable fortress of logic and empathy. Your very presence is a calming influence. The Logical Framework you provide now includes immunity to [Fear], and you yourself are permanently resistant to [Disoriented]—your coherence cannot be easily shaken.

### Capstone — Moment of Lucidity

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Prerequisite** | 40 PP spent in Hug-læknir tree |
| **Type** | Reaction (once per combat) |
| **Cost** | ALL remaining Stamina + massive irresistible Psychic Stress + 1 Runic Blight Corruption |
| **Trigger** | When an ally would gain a permanent [Trauma] from reaching maximum Psychic Stress |
| **Effect** | WITS + Rhetoric check (high DC); on success, ally does NOT gain Trauma, Stress reset to 75 |

The capstone **Moment of Lucidity** is the ultimate psychological intervention—a spiritual and intellectual defibrillator for a mind on the brink of a total system crash.

In the final, critical moment before an ally's psyche shatters completely, you can intervene with a single, perfect, reality-affirming truth. You reach into the screaming, paradoxical static of their breaking mind and inject coherence.

This is not a gentle healing. It is a desperate, last-second gambit.

> *"You have achieved a perfect understanding of a coherent mind's breaking point. In the final, critical moment before an ally's psyche shatters, you can intervene with a single, perfect, reality-affirming truth."*

**The Resolution**:
1. **Trigger**: An ally's Psychic Stress reaches 100 and they would gain a permanent [Trauma]
2. **Choice**: You are prompted: "Intervene with Moment of Lucidity?" 
3. **Check**: WITS + Rhetoric vs. high DC (e.g., DC 7)
4. **Success**: Ally does NOT gain Trauma; their Stress is reset to 75
5. **Failure**: Intervention fails; ally makes standard Trauma check
6. **Cost (regardless of outcome)**: You take massive, irresistible Psychic Stress (e.g., 75 Stress) AND gain 1 permanent Runic Blight Corruption

**The Sacrifice**: This is the one time that the purely "coherent" Hug-læknir must willingly interface with the world's most chaotic anti-logic. To save an ally from Trauma, you must open your own mind to the catastrophic psychic event. You absorb the full backlash. You take the Corruption into yourself.

It is the ultimate act of selfless, empathetic sacrifice.

> *"Is saving one ally from one Trauma worth crippling the party's primary mind-healer for the rest of the fight and permanently scarring their soul?"*

## Systemic Integration

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Source | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Empathic Burden** | Gain ~20% of Stress removed from patients |
| **Moment of Lucidity** | Massive irresistible Stress + 1 Corruption |
| **Environmental Exposure** | Standard Stress from Psychic Resonance zones |
| **Combat Stress** | Standard Stress from Blighted enemies |

The Hug-læknir has a **unique relationship** with the Trauma Economy. They are the premier management tool for it—the "healer" for Psychic Stress "damage"—but they are also uniquely vulnerable to it.

Their Empathic Burden passive means they slowly accumulate Stress over time. Their capstone inflicts catastrophic Stress and permanent Corruption. They are not immune to the very damage type they heal—they are more exposed to it than anyone.

This creates a distinctive meta-role: the Hug-læknir needs someone to manage *their* Stress. They need sanctuaries for recovery. They need a Bone-Setter or Kaupmaðr to provide access to Stress-reducing consumables. The healer needs a healer.

### Mitigation Tools

| Tool | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Trained Empathy** | +1d10 to personal Resolve Checks |
| **Fortress of the Mind** | Permanent [Disoriented] resistance |
| **Party Sanctuary** | Recovery time between encounters |
| **Consumables** | Stress-reducing potions and tinctures |
| **Kaupmaðr Investment** | Sanctuary zones with reduced Stress gain |

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Berserkr** | High-Stress heretical path; Hug-læknir enables their risky gameplay |
| **Echo-Caller** | Self-inflicting Stress specialist; desperately needs mind-healing |
| **Jötun-Reader** | Accumulates Stress from corrupted knowledge; needs stabilization |
| **Blót-Priest** | Heretical Mystic with HP/Stress costs; benefits from triage |
| **Bone-Setter** | Combined medical team: Bone-Setter heals HP, Hug-læknir heals Stress |
| **Skjaldmær** | Tank who can protect the vulnerable Hug-læknir during treatment |
| **Low-WILL Characters** | Anyone with poor Resolve benefits enormously from fortification |

> *"The Hug-læknir is the best friend of any character who self-inflicts Stress or has a low WILL score. They are a force multiplier for the entire party's longevity."*

### Optimal Conditions

| Situation | Advantage |
|-----------|-----------|
| **High-Stress Environments** | [Psychic Resonance] zones, Blight-heavy biomes |
| **Mind-Affecting Enemies** | Forlorn, Genius Loci, Cursed Choir entities |
| **Heretical Party Members** | Berserkr, Echo-Caller, Blót-Priest |
| **Long Expeditions** | Stress accumulates over time; Hug-læknir keeps party viable |
| **Boss Fights** | High-Stress moments where Trauma prevention is critical |

### Weakness Conditions

| Situation | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| **Mindless Enemies** | Beasts, constructs that inflict physical damage only |
| **Physical Damage Focus** | Fights where HP damage matters more than Stress |
| **Solo Play** | Cannot heal self; entirely reliant on party protection |
| **Short Encounters** | Not enough time for Stress to accumulate |
| **No Sanctuary Access** | Unable to recover from Empathic Burden accumulation |

## Lore Integration

### Historical Development

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| **Pre-Glitch** | Formal psychology existed in limited forms within the Aesir hierarchy |
| **Post-Glitch Chaos** | Mass psychic trauma; survivors developed ad-hoc coping techniques |
| **First Mind-Healers** | Individuals who noticed patterns in mental breakdown and recovery |
| **Formalization** | Bone-Setters' Collegium began documenting and teaching mind-healing protocols |
| **Modern Practice** | Hug-læknir as recognized specialization with codified techniques |

The Hug-læknir tradition emerged from necessity. In the years after the Ginnungagap Glitch, the survivors faced a new kind of wound—one that didn't bleed, but broke minds. The Cursed Choir's eternal psychic scream drove thousands mad. Settlements fell not to raiders or Undying, but to mass hysteria and collective breakdown.

Some individuals noticed patterns. They saw that certain grounding techniques helped. They observed that coherent narratives provided anchors. They documented what worked and what didn't. They became the first mind-healers.

The Bone-Setters' Collegium eventually formalized these observations into a discipline. The Hug-læknir was born—not from magic or divine revelation, but from careful, clinical observation of a new and terrifying disease.

### The Art of Mind-Healing

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Observe First** | Assess before treating; understand the specific fracture |
| **Fortify Proactively** | Prevention is better than cure; prepare minds for trauma |
| **Ground in Coherence** | Simple truths, logical frameworks, shared narratives |
| **Accept the Burden** | The healer cannot avoid absorbing some of the pain |
| **Know Your Limits** | Do not overreach; unmanaged burden breaks healers |

The Hug-læknir operates by principles, not incantations. They are scientists of a new field, not priests of an old faith. Their techniques are replicable, teachable, and based on observable results.

> *"Call hygiene windows; sanctuaries and wards magnify outcomes. Record Stress curves by room and foe; tomorrow's pacing improves with today's ledger."*

### Instruments and Kit

| Instrument | Function |
|------------|----------|
| **Cord Counters** | Physical anchors for grounding exercises |
| **Slate Prompts** | Written mantras and logical frameworks |
| **Tinctures** | For throat and breath (calming voice work) |
| **Blindfold and Ear Baffles** | Sensory reduction for crisis intervention |
| **Ledger** | Documentation of Stress curves and treatment outcomes |

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Structured De-escalation** | Step-by-step calming protocols |
| **Grounding Exercises** | "Name five things you can see..." |
| **Exposure Pacing** | Controlled introduction to stressors |
| **Cognitive Scaffolding** | Building temporary mental frameworks |
| **Strain Redistribution** | Managing Empathic Burden across healers |

### Factional Relationships

| Faction | Relationship |
|---------|--------------|
| **Bone-Setters' Collegium** | Natural home; many Hug-læknir trained here |
| **Jötun-Readers** | Valued partners; Readers need mind-healing after archive dives |
| **God-Sleepers** | Wary relationship; pilgrimage stress creates demand |
| **Iron-Banes** | Complicated; Crusaders often need treatment but distrust "soft" methods |
| **Rust-Clans** | Respected; long expeditions create high demand |
| **Rangers Guild** | Essential; trail stress requires regular triage |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic/Survivor)
*"In the tales, they are the quiet ones who walk into the screaming and walk out leading the broken by the hand. They don't fight the darkness with blades—they fight it with words, with patience, with a calm voice that cuts through the howling. When a warrior's eyes go empty and they start clawing at their own face, when a Reader comes back from the archives speaking only in numbers, when the Scream finally gets inside and starts rewriting who you are—that's when you pray for a Mind-Healer. They sit with you in the darkness. They remind you of your name. They show you the shape of your own story before the noise took it. They take a piece of your pain into themselves so you don't have to carry it alone. The good ones, they're half-broken themselves—held together by will and duty and the faces of everyone they've saved. But they keep going. They always keep going."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Hug-læknir (Mind-Healer) represents the Coherent Adept specialization optimized for Trauma Economy management. Mechanical role: pure psychological support with no direct combat contribution. Key differentiator: only specialization dedicated entirely to Psychic Stress removal and mental status effect mitigation. Core mechanics: Psychic Triage (Stress removal), Cognitive Fortification (Stress resistance buffs), Narrative Re-compilation (mental debuff removal). Signature ability: Moment of Lucidity (capstone reaction that prevents permanent Trauma at cost of massive self-inflicted Stress and Corruption). Trauma Economy interaction: Moderate risk—Empathic Burden passive transfers patient Stress to healer; capstone inflicts catastrophic personal cost. Optimal deployment: high-Stress environments, parties with heretical/low-WILL members, long expeditions where Stress accumulation threatens party viability."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Hug-læknir (Mind-Healer). ARCHETYPE: Adept. PATH TYPE: Coherent (Moderate Trauma Risk via Empathic Burden). ROLE: Psychological Support / Sanity-Mender / Trauma Specialist. PRIMARY STAT: WITS. SECONDARY STAT: WILL. RESOURCE: Stamina. CORE MECHANICS: Psychic Triage (Stress removal), Cognitive Fortification (+dice to Resolve Checks), Narrative Re-compilation (remove [Feared]/[Disoriented], prevent [Trauma]). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Empathy): Trained Empathy, Psychic Triage, Assess Psyche. T2 (Advanced Counseling): Logical Framework, Soothing Word, Empathic Burden. T3 (Mastery of Coherence): Shared Saga, Fortress of the Mind. CAPSTONE: Moment of Lucidity (reaction to prevent Trauma; cost: all Stamina + massive irresistible Stress + 1 Corruption; WITS + Rhetoric check vs DC 7). SYNERGIES: Berserkr/Echo-Caller/Blót-Priest (high-Stress heretical paths), Jötun-Reader (Stress from knowledge), Bone-Setter (combined HP/Stress medical team), low-WILL characters. COUNTERS: Mindless enemies (beasts, constructs), physical damage focus, solo play, short encounters."*

## Summary

The Hug-læknir is the **sanity healer** of Aethelgard.

Where the Bone-Setter mends flesh and the Brewmaster provides consumables, the Hug-læknir works on the invisible damage—the Psychic Stress that accumulates in every survivor of the Age of Echoes. They understand that the wounds of the soul are as real and as deadly as the wounds of the flesh. They are the therapists of a broken world, the debuggers of corrupted minds.

Their power is unique. They are the premier, non-consumable source of Psychic Stress removal. They can fortify minds against incoming trauma. They can break through panic and confusion to restore coherence. And at the ultimate extreme, they can prevent a permanent Trauma—the most devastating mechanical penalty in the game—at enormous personal cost.

But their power comes with risk. The Empathic Burden means they absorb some of the trauma they heal. Their capstone inflicts catastrophic Stress and permanent Corruption. The healer needs a healer. The anchor of sanity is slowly eroded by their own selfless work.

Their combat contribution is zero. They cannot deal damage, they cannot tank, they cannot even heal HP. In fights against mindless beasts that inflict no Psychic Stress, they are nearly useless.

But in the deep places—the Blight-choked ruins, the Psychic Resonance zones, the fights against the Forlorn and the Genius Loci—they are *essential*. Without a Hug-læknir, parties break. Traumas accumulate. Minds shatter. Expeditions end not in death, but in madness.

They are the quiet ones who walk into the screaming.
They are the voice that reminds you of your name.
They are the ones who carry a piece of your pain so you don't have to carry it alone.

*The wound you cannot see is the wound that kills.*
*But the wound you cannot see can also be healed.*
*Observe. Fortify. Relieve.*
*Coherence is the goal.*
