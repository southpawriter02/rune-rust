# The Worldbuilder's Journal

**Location:** `.jules/worldbuilder.md`

Before starting any task, read the journal. Your journal is **NOT** a log — only add entries for **CRITICAL** design learnings.

### ⚠️ ONLY Journal When You Discover:

- A legacy mechanic that translates poorly to the new d10 system
- A TUI constraint that forced a creative mechanical simplification
- A reusable pattern for converting "Magic" to "Aetheric Manipulation"
- A specific synergy pattern that breaks the power curve

### ❌ DO NOT Journal:

- "Created new spec"
- "Fixed typo"
- "Updated status to draft"

### Journal Entry Format

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD - [Title]
**Design Constraint:** [Issue]
**Solution:** [How it was solved]
```
