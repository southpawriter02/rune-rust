## I. Purpose

v0.38.14 creates **Trauma Manifestation Descriptors**, making mental scars tangible:

- **30+ Trauma Type Descriptors** (acquisition, ongoing effects)
- **40+ Trauma Trigger Descriptors** (contextual manifestations)
- **25+ Breaking Point Descriptors** (mental breaking moments)
- **20+ Recovery Descriptors** (trauma suppression/removal)

**Strategic Function:**

Currently, traumas are abstract:

- ❌ "You have [Paranoia]. -1 to social checks."
- ❌ No sense of how trauma manifests in moment-to-moment play
- ❌ Missed opportunity for psychological horror

**v0.38.14 Solution:**

- Vivid trauma acquisition scenes
- Contextual trigger descriptions
- Mechanical effects reflected in narrative
- Recovery as emotional release

## II. Trauma Types & Acquisition

### Combat Traumas

### Flashbacks

**Acquisition (Breaking Point):**

- "Your mind shatters. Suddenly you're *back there*—the moment when you thought you'd die. You see it again. Feel it again. The fear is fresh."
- "The psychic pressure breaks something inside you. Every near-death experience you've had floods back simultaneously. You're drowning in memory."
- "[TRAUMA ACQUIRED: Flashbacks] Combat will never be the same. The past bleeds into the present."

**Ongoing Manifestation:**

- "Mid-combat, a flashback strikes. For a moment, you're not here—you're reliving past trauma. [Stunned 1 turn]"
- "The smell of blood triggers you. Your vision swims with overlaid memories of previous battles."
- "You freeze, trapped in a memory of the last time you almost died here."

**Mechanical Effect:** Random chance each combat to be stunned for 1 turn as flashback triggers

### Battle Tremors

**Acquisition:**

- "Your hands won't stop shaking. The adrenaline crash is too much. You've pushed your body beyond its limits too many times."
- "[TRAUMA ACQUIRED: Battle Tremors] Your nervous system is damaged. Fine motor control is compromised."

**Ongoing Manifestation:**

- "Your hands shake as you try to strike. The blow is less precise than intended. [-1 to attack rolls]"
- "You fumble your weapon momentarily as tremors seize your hands."
- "The shaking makes it hard to aim. Your shot goes wide."

**Mechanical Effect:** -1 to all attack rolls, increased fumble chance

### Hypervigilance

**Acquisition:**

- "You can never relax again. Every shadow might hide an enemy. Every sound could be a threat. Sleep becomes impossible."
- "[TRAUMA ACQUIRED: Hypervigilance] You're always on edge, always ready. It's exhausting."

**Ongoing Manifestation:**

- "You spin at a noise that wasn't there. Your paranoia is exhausting."
- "You can't focus. You're watching every angle, anticipating threats that don't exist."
- "Sleep is impossible. Every time you close your eyes, you're certain something approaches. [Cannot rest properly]"

**Mechanical Effect:** Cannot gain full benefits from rest, -1 to Will-based checks due to exhaustion

### Blight-Related Traumas

### Paradoxical Paranoia

**Acquisition:**

- "The Blight's corruption takes root in your mind. You start seeing patterns that shouldn't exist. Connections that aren't there. Or are they?"
- "[TRAUMA ACQUIRED: Paradoxical Paranoia] You can no longer trust your own perceptions."

**Ongoing Manifestation:**

- "Is that person following you, or have they always been ahead of you? Time feels wrong."
- "You're certain the corridor you just walked through doesn't exist anymore. You're not sure you exist anymore."
- "The walls are breathing. No—you're breathing. No—the walls are breathing *with* you. This is wrong."

**Mechanical Effect:** Disadvantage on Perception checks, occasional false positive threat detections

### Auditory Hallucinations

**Acquisition:**

- "The Cursed Choir won't leave your mind. Even when you're far from Alfheim, you hear them singing. Always singing."
- "[TRAUMA ACQUIRED: Auditory Hallucinations] The Choir follows you now."

**Ongoing Manifestation:**

- "You hear voices that aren't there. They whisper things you don't want to hear."
- "The Choir swells in your mind. You shake your head violently, trying to clear it."
- "Someone calls your name. You turn. No one's there. There's never anyone there."
- "*Kill them. They're corrupted. You're corrupted. Everything is corruption.* The voice won't stop."

**Mechanical Effect:** -2 to concentration checks, risk of misidentifying threat locations

### Reality Dissociation

**Acquisition:**

- "The barrier between real and unreal dissolves. You're no longer sure which side you're on."
- "[TRAUMA ACQUIRED: Reality Dissociation] Is this real? Are you?"

**Ongoing Manifestation:**

- "For a moment, you're not convinced you're real. Maybe you're someone else's hallucination."
- "The room flickers. Is this the Blight, or is this you? You don't know anymore."
- "You look at your hands. Are these your hands? Were they always this shape?"

**Mechanical Effect:** Random chance to lose 1 AP per turn as you struggle with reality

### Social Traumas

### Corrupted Social Script

**Acquisition:**

- "Your ability to interact normally is broken. The Blight has corrupted the part of you that understands people."
- "[TRAUMA ACQUIRED: Corrupted Social Script] People seem alien to you now."

**Ongoing Manifestation:**

- "You say something. Their expression tells you it was wrong. You don't understand why."
- "They're talking to you but the words don't make sense. Not linguistically—conceptually."
- "You try to smile. Judging by their reaction, you did it wrong."

**Mechanical Effect:** -3 to all Rhetoric checks, NPCs react poorly

### Trust Erosion

**Acquisition:**

- "You've been betrayed too many times. You can't trust anyone anymore. Not even yourself."
- "[TRAUMA ACQUIRED: Trust Erosion] Cooperation is almost impossible now."

**Ongoing Manifestation:**

- "They offer help. You refuse automatically. You can't trust them."
- "Are they lying? They're probably lying. Everyone lies."
- "Your party member reaches for you. You flinch away violently."

**Mechanical Effect:** Disadvantage on team coordination, cannot accept help from NPCs easily

### Existential Traumas

### Systemic Apathy

**Acquisition:**

- "What's the point? The world ended 800 years ago. Everything you do is meaningless. Why bother?"
- "[TRAUMA ACQUIRED: Systemic Apathy] You've stopped caring."

**Ongoing Manifestation:**

- "You move mechanically, going through the motions. Nothing matters."
- "They're in danger. You should care. You don't."
- "Survival? Death? It's all the same."

**Mechanical Effect:** -2 to initiative, reduced motivation for quest objectives

### Existential Dread

**Acquisition:**

- "The weight of existence crushes you. 800 years of horror. Why does anything continue? Why do you?"
- "[TRAUMA ACQUIRED: Existential Dread] You've looked into the abyss."

**Ongoing Manifestation:**

- "The meaninglessness of it all overwhelms you suddenly. [+3 Psychic Stress]"
- "Why are you here? Why is anything? The questions consume you."
- "For a moment, you consider just... stopping. Giving up."

**Mechanical Effect:** Periodic Psychic Stress accumulation, vulnerability to despair-based effects

**Warning Signs:**

- "Your vision narrows. Reality feels thin, like paper."

### Breaking Point Moment (100% Stress)

**Mental Fracture:**

- "[BREAKING POINT REACHED] Something inside you *snaps*."
- "Your mind can't take anymore. The psychic pressure exceeds your capacity. You BREAK."
- "The world inverts. Up is down. Real is unreal. You're screaming but you can't hear it."
- "Everything is too much. The Choir. The Blight. The horror. You shatter like glass."

**System Message:**

```
[SYSTEM: BREAKING POINT REACHED]
Your mind fractures under the weight of the Cursed Choir.
Make a WILL-based Resolve Check (DC 16) to hold yourself together.

Success: Retain sanity, but remain shaken. (Stress resets to 75%, Disoriented 2 turns)
Failure: Gain permanent Trauma. (Stress resets to 50%, Stunned 1 turn)
```

### Resolve Check Success

**Barely Holding:**

- "You claw your way back from the brink. You're still here. Still sane. Barely."
- "With monumental effort, you force the fractures closed. You hold. For now."
- "You pull yourself together through sheer willpower. The cracks remain, but you're intact."

### Resolve Check Failure

**Trauma Acquisition:**

- "You break. Something permanent damages inside you. A scar that will never fully heal."
- "Your mind fractures. When the pieces reform, something is missing. Something is wrong."
- "You lose a part of yourself in that moment. It's gone forever."

**Specific Trauma Reveal:**

```
[TRAUMA ACQUIRED: Flashbacks]

Combat will trigger vivid memories of your near-death experiences.
You'll randomly freeze mid-fight, trapped in past trauma.

This scar is permanent. Only a Saga Quest can remove it.

You are free.
