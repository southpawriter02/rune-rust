# The Norn-Spinner — The Scripter of a Broken Reality

> *"The old Norns wove fate upon a loom. The Great Glitch was the sound of that loom shattering. I do not weave upon the broken threads—I write new code into the gaps between them. 'If this ally bleeds, then that enemy bleeds.' This is not magic. This is programming. And in a system this unstable, every new script risks a catastrophic crash."*

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Mystic |
| **Role** | Causality Weaver / System Scripter / High-Skill Controller |
| **Path Type** | Heretical |
| **Primary Attribute** | WILL |
| **Secondary Attribute** | WITS |
| **Resource System** | Aether Pool (AP) + Coherent Data (unique) |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | High (Corruption from Weaves; Psychic Stress from Scrying) |

The **Norn-Spinner** is the Mystic specialization that embodies the heretical philosophy that the world's broken code can be not just nudged, but actively and temporarily rewritten.

They are not casters or psychics in the traditional sense; they are **Causality Weavers** and **System Scripters**. Descended from the mythical, three-armed Trikainen, they possess a unique, multi-threaded perception of reality that allows them to perform the complex art of weaving—creating tangible, logical links of cause-and-effect between different entities on the battlefield.

To choose the Norn-Spinner is to embrace the fantasy of the **master of fate** and the **ultimate combo-enabler**. Your magic is the art of writing temporary "if/then" statements into the world's OS. Your saga is a complex chronicle of perfect execution and spectacular system crashes, a story of trying to impose a higher, more complex order on a world that can barely handle simple logic.

## Core Philosophy: The Scripter of a Broken Reality

### The Shattered Loom

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Code, Not Magic** | The world runs on broken source code; we are programmers, not wizards |
| **Variables and Scripts** | Tag entities as variables, then write conditional relationships between them |
| **Calculated Risk** | Every script injected into a virus-ridden system risks catastrophic errors |

In a world running on catastrophically broken source code, the Norn-Spinner is a heretical mystic who sees the "tapestry of fate" for what it truly is: **a series of tangled, glitching subroutines**.

They do not just nudge the code like the Örlög-bound; they actively write new scripts.

> *"The Skald tells stories to stabilize reality. The Örlög-bound tweaks probability variables. I do something far more dangerous: I write new code entirely. 'If Gorm is struck, then the Draugr feels his pain.' This is a conditional statement injected directly into the world's operating system. The system does not like foreign code. It fights back. Sometimes it crashes. But when my scripts compile successfully? The battlefield bends to my design."*

Their saga is one of calculated heresy—the deliberate violation of reality's source code in exchange for tactical supremacy.

### The Heretical Path

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Source** | Direct reality-editing; injecting code into broken OS |
| **Method** | Tag Variables → Write Weaves → Execute Conditional Effects |
| **Cost** | Runic Blight Corruption (from Weaves) + Psychic Stress (from Scrying) |
| **Philosophy** | Impose complex order on a system that barely handles simple logic |

The Norn-Spinner walks the **heretical path**. Every successful Weave is a direct gain of Runic Blight Corruption. Their analysis tool, Scry the Flow, is a direct source of Psychic Stress. They are constantly trading their soul's purity for tactical control.

> *"The Grove-Warden channels uncorrupted source code. The Vard-Warden builds stable patches. I inject *foreign* code—my own logic—into a system designed to reject anything coherent. This is heresy. The Blight does not forgive intrusion. Every Weave I cast leaves another stain on my soul. But the alternative is chaos without meaning. I choose heresy over helplessness."*

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Master of fate; combo enabler; chess master of the battlefield |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Tag → Tag → Weave → Watch the dominoes fall |
| **Success Metric** | Perfect setups executed; synergies amplified; fates linked |
| **Decision Space** | Who to tag; which weave to cast; when to execute; risk vs. reward |

Playing a Norn-Spinner is about **strategic setup and devastating payoff**.

Your operational loop is:
1. **Perceive the Code**: Use Code Perception to understand magical phenomena
2. **Tag Variables**: Apply Causal Threads to key allies and enemies
3. **Write the Script**: Choose the appropriate Weave for the situation
4. **Execute**: Watch your conditional logic reshape the battlefield
5. **Manage Risk**: Balance Corruption gain against tactical advantage
6. **Build Resources**: Use Scry the Flow to generate Coherent Data

> *"I spend my first turn tagging Gorm—our tank—with a Causal Thread. Second turn, I tag the Draugr Jarl. Third turn, I cast Retribution. Now, for the next two rounds, every time the Jarl strikes Gorm, the Jarl feels 50% of that damage reflected back as Psychic damage. The enemy is literally punished for attacking our tank. This is not magic. This is programming. And I am very, very good at programming."*

You are the party's **force multiplier**—the specialist who makes everyone else more effective through perfectly orchestrated causal links.

### The Trade-Off

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Ultimate combo enabler | Extreme setup cost (3+ actions to activate) |
| Doubles effectiveness of allies | High Trauma Economy cost (Corruption + Psychic Stress) |
| Unique tactical control | Wild Magic Surge risk on every Weave |
| Highest skill ceiling in game | Punishing when setups fail or are disrupted |

The Norn-Spinner has the **highest skill ceiling** of any specialization. When played perfectly, they turn the entire party into a devastating, synergistic machine. When played poorly—or when their setups are disrupted—they contribute almost nothing.

> *"The Berserkr swings and deals damage. Simple. Effective. I spend three turns setting up a Weave that might not even trigger if the enemy dies too fast or changes targets. My power is *conditional*. It requires planning, prediction, and perfect timing. When it works, I am the most valuable member of the party. When it fails, I have wasted three turns and gained Corruption for nothing. This is the Norn-Spinner's bargain."*

## Core Mechanics: The Three Pillars

### Pillar 1: Causal Threads (Tagging Variables)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Mark entities as variables for future scripts |
| **Effect** | Applies \[Causal Thread\] status (neutral; does nothing alone) |
| **Duration** | 3 rounds |
| **Capacity** | 2 threads active (base); 3 threads at Tier 3 |

**Causal Threads** are the foundational mechanic—the act of declaring variables in the source code of reality.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **What It Is** | A metaphysical "tag" or "pointer" marking an entity |
| **What It Does Alone** | Nothing; it is pure potential |
| **What It Enables** | Required target for all Weave abilities |
| **Visibility** | Visible to allies as shimmering ethereal threads |

> *"A Causal Thread is not a buff. It is not a debuff. It is a *pointer*—a variable declaration in the language of reality. 'Let X equal Gorm. Let Y equal the Draugr.' The Thread itself does nothing. It simply marks the entity as relevant to my next script. Without variables, I cannot write code. Without Threads, I cannot Weave."*

### Pillar 2: Complex Weaving (Writing the Script)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Define logical relationships between tagged entities |
| **Effect** | Creates conditional "if/then" statements in reality |
| **Cost** | AP + Corruption (always) + Coherent Data (for stable weaves) |
| **Risk** | Every Weave has a chance to trigger Wild Magic Surge |

**Complex Weaving** is the core action—the moment the Norn-Spinner injects their foreign code into the world's broken operating system.

| Weave Type | Logic |
|------------|-------|
| **Retribution** | "IF tagged ally takes damage, THEN tagged enemy takes 50% as Psychic" |
| **Shared Vigor** | "IF tagged ally receives healing, THEN other tagged ally receives 50%" |
| **Shared Misfortune** | "IF tagged enemy gains status effect, THEN other tagged enemy gains same" |

> *"A Weave is a conditional statement written into reality's source code. 'If Gorm bleeds, then the Draugr bleeds.' The system does not want this code. It is foreign. It is heretical. The Blight fights my injection, and sometimes it wins—that's the Wild Magic Surge. But when my code compiles successfully? The battlefield operates according to *my* logic, not the chaos of the Glitch."*

### Pillar 3: Coherent Data (The Uncorrupted Resource)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Maximum** | 3 Coherent Data |
| **Generation** | Scry the Flow (guaranteed); Efficient Code (chance on trigger) |
| **Spending** | Required for stable Weaves; reduces Wild Magic Surge chance |
| **Function** | Fragments of pure, pre-Blight logic "cached" from the broken system |

**Coherent Data** represents the Norn-Spinner's accumulated understanding of how reality *should* work—clean code in a corrupted system.

| Source | Coherent Data Gained |
|--------|----------------------|
| Scry the Flow (successful) | +1 |
| Efficient Code (Weave triggered) | +1 (chance) |

| Usage | Coherent Data Cost |
|-------|-------------------|
| Shared Vigor | 1 |
| The Great Rewrite | All remaining |

> *"Coherent Data is not Aether. It is not mana. It is *clean code*—fragments of logic I have observed and cached from the rare moments when reality operates correctly. When I spend Coherent Data on a Weave, I am essentially wrapping my foreign code in stable, pre-Blight logic. The system is more likely to accept it. The crash is less likely to occur. Coherent Data is precious. It is sanity in a world of chaos."*

## Abilities: The Path of the Scripter

### Tier 1 — Foundational Scripting

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Code Perception** | Passive | — | Bonus die to WITS checks for magic/glitches; unlocks Coherent Data (Max 3) |
| **Tag Variable** | Active | 25 AP | Apply \[Causal Thread\] to one target for 3 rounds; max 2 active |
| **Simple Weave: Retribution** | Active | 40 AP | Link ally to enemy; ally damage reflects 50% as Psychic to enemy |

**Code Perception** is the foundation—the paradigm shift in perception that makes all Weaving possible.

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Passive Bonus | +1 bonus die to all WITS checks to perceive magical phenomena |
| Glitch Detection | Can identify source of Reality Glitches |
| Resource Unlock | Enables Coherent Data resource (Maximum 3) |

> *"The Trikainen lineage grants us something other Mystics lack: multi-threaded perception. We see the underlying causal links and data flows that govern this broken reality. Where others see a Draugr shambling toward them, I see a corrupted process executing a 'seek-and-destroy' subroutine. Where others see a healing spell, I see restorative code being applied to a damaged file. This perception is the foundation of everything we do."*

**Tag Variable** is the bread-and-butter setup—the variable declaration.

| Rank | AP Cost | Duration | Max Threads |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| Rank 1 | 25 AP | 3 rounds | 2 |
| Rank 2 | 20 AP | 3 rounds | 2 |
| Rank 3 | 20 AP | 4 rounds | 2 (3 with Efficient Code) |

> *"I focus on the entity—ally or enemy—and mark its 'source code' with a shimmering thread of potential. The Thread does nothing by itself. It is a pointer, a variable declaration. 'Let X equal this Draugr.' Now X exists in my script space. Now I can write conditional statements that reference X. This is the first step in any Weave."*

**Simple Weave: Retribution** is the foundational offensive Weave—punishment for aggression.

| Rank | AP Cost | Duration | Damage Reflection |
|------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Rank 1 | 40 AP | 2 rounds | 50% as Psychic |
| Rank 2 | 35 AP | 2 rounds | 50% as Psychic |
| Rank 3 | 35 AP | 3 rounds | 60% as Psychic |

> *"I write a simple, punitive script: 'IF the tagged ally takes damage from an attack, THEN the tagged enemy suffers 50% of that damage as Psychic damage.' The system accepts my code. The Weave is active. Now, for the next two rounds, every time the Draugr Jarl strikes Gorm, the Jarl feels an echo of that pain tearing through its corrupted consciousness. Attack our tank? Pay the price."*

### Tier 2 — Advanced Weaving

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Scry the Flow** | Active | 30 AP | WILL check reveals enemy's next action; +1 Coherent Data; +Psychic Stress |
| **Simple Weave: Shared Vigor** | Active | 45 AP + 1 CD | Link two allies; healing on one → 50% to other |
| **Stable Compiler** | Passive | — | Reduced Wild Magic Surge chance on Weaves |

**Scry the Flow** is the intelligence-gathering tool—and the primary Coherent Data generator.

| Rank | AP Cost | Effect | Psychic Stress |
|------|---------|--------|----------------|
| Rank 2 | 30 AP | Reveal enemy's next action; +1 Coherent Data | Moderate |
| Rank 3 | 25 AP | Reveal enemy's next action; +1 Coherent Data | Moderate |

> *"I attune my senses to the flow of corrupted data around the enemy, reading its predictive algorithms. This is not fortune-telling—it is debugging. I see the 'if/then' statements governing its next action. 'IF player_tank_in_range THEN execute_heavy_attack.' Now I know what it will do. Now I can plan accordingly. But this direct mental interface with Blighted logic is taxing. The Psychic Stress is the price of foresight."*

**Simple Weave: Shared Vigor** is the supportive Weave—amplifying healing efficiency.

| Rank | AP Cost | CD Cost | Healing Share |
|------|---------|---------|---------------|
| Rank 2 | 45 AP | 1 CD | 50% |
| Rank 3 | 40 AP | 1 CD | 75% |

> *"I link two allies with a benevolent script: 'IF restorative code is applied to ally A, THEN apply 50% of that code to ally B.' When the Bone-Setter heals Gorm for 40 HP, the Skald automatically receives 20 HP. I have effectively doubled the healer's efficiency. This is not magic. This is efficient resource distribution through conditional logic."*

**Stable Compiler** is the risk-mitigation passive—learning to write cleaner code.

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Primary | Reduced chance of Wild Magic Surge on Weave abilities |
| Secondary | Slightly increased chance of minor, cosmetic Reality Glitches |

> *"My understanding of the corrupted OS deepens. I learn to write scripts that are less likely to cause a total system crash. My code is cleaner, more efficient, more compatible with the broken architecture. Catastrophic failures become rare. Minor glitches—cosmetic errors, harmless flickering—become more common. I'll take a thousand harmless glitches over one catastrophic surge."*

### Tier 3 — Mastery of Causality

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Complex Weave: Shared Misfortune** | Active | 55 AP | Link two enemies; status effects spread between them |
| **Efficient Code** | Passive | — | 3 max threads; Weave triggers may generate Coherent Data |

**Complex Weave: Shared Misfortune** is the masterful malicious script—doubling debuff effectiveness.

| Rank | AP Cost | Duration | Effect |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| Rank 2 | 55 AP | 2 rounds | Status effects on one enemy apply to other for 1 round |
| Rank 3 | 50 AP | 3 rounds | Status effects on one enemy apply to other for 2 rounds |

> *"A masterful, malicious script. I link the fates of two enemies: 'IF enemy A is afflicted with a non-damaging status effect, THEN enemy B is afflicted with the same effect.' When our Thul terrifies the Draugr Jarl, the Revenant beside it also feels that Fear. When the Grove-Warden Roots one, both are Rooted. I have effectively doubled the efficiency of every controller in the party."*

**Efficient Code** is the mastery passive—elegant, self-sustaining scripts.

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Thread Capacity | Maximum active Causal Threads increased to 3 |
| Resource Generation | When Weave condition triggers, chance to generate +1 Coherent Data |
| AP Recovery | Successful Weave triggers regenerate small amount of AP |

> *"My scripts become elegant and self-sustaining. The successful execution of a causal link provides coherent feedback that fuels my next creation. When Retribution triggers—when the Draugr feels Gorm's pain—I cache that moment of clean logic. The system worked as intended. That's rare. That's precious. That's Coherent Data."*

### Capstone — The Great Rewrite

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Cost** | 90 AP + All remaining Coherent Data |
| **Limit** | Once per combat |
| **Chant** | 1 full turn (applies Causal Thread to ALL combatants) |
| **Options** | Harmonic Convergence OR Entropic Cascade |
| **Trauma** | Massive Psychic Stress + Massive Runic Blight Corruption |

The capstone **The Great Rewrite** is the ultimate act of reality-scripting—seizing control of the battlefield's master clock.

**Option 1: Harmonic Convergence**
> For 2 rounds, all damage dealt by allies is added to a central "pool." At the end of each round, this damage is redistributed evenly among all enemies as pure Psychic damage.

**Option 2: Entropic Cascade**
> For 2 rounds, all damage taken by allies is added to a central "pool." At the end of each round, this damage is unleashed upon a single enemy of the Norn-Spinner's choice.

> *"The Great Rewrite is the moment I cease to be a scripter and become the system administrator. I seize control of the battlefield's master clock. I apply a Causal Thread to every combatant—friend and foe alike. Then I execute a single, grand, causal function: either I pool all ally damage and redistribute it as devastating Psychic damage to every enemy, or I pool all ally suffering and unleash it as a catastrophic strike on a single target. This is not a spell. This is a hostile takeover of reality's operating system. And the system *will* punish me for it."*

## Systemic Integration

### The Ultimate High-Skill Class

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Primary Function** | Combo enabler; force multiplier; tactical controller |
| **Power Source** | Direct reality-editing; code injection into broken OS |
| **Unique Contribution** | Only specialization with conditional cause-and-effect linking |

The Norn-Spinner is **arguably the most complex specialization in the game**. Their power is entirely dependent on the player's ability to plan several turns in advance, correctly identify the key targets to tag, and execute their Weave at the most impactful moment.

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Heretical (High Trauma risk) |
| **Corruption Sources** | Every successful Weave inflicts Runic Blight Corruption |
| **Psychic Stress Sources** | Scry the Flow (direct mental interface with Blighted logic) |
| **Trauma Economy Role** | High-cost, high-reward; trades soul purity for tactical control |

The Norn-Spinner is a **core heretical class**:
- Every Weave = Corruption gain
- Scry the Flow = Psychic Stress gain
- The Great Rewrite = Massive amounts of both

> *"I am not like the Grove-Warden, channeling uncorrupted code. I am not like the Vard-Warden, building stable patches. Every script I write is foreign code injected into a virus-ridden system. The Blight does not forgive intrusion. My soul darkens with every Weave. My mind frays with every Scrying. This is the price of playing god with causality. I pay it willingly."*

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Controllers (Thul, Grove-Warden)** | Shared Misfortune doubles their status effect efficiency |
| **Healers (Bone-Setter, Grove-Warden)** | Shared Vigor doubles healing efficiency |
| **Tanks (Skjaldmær, Atgeir-Wielder)** | Retribution punishes enemies for attacking tank |
| **Damage Dealers** | Harmonic Convergence pools and redistributes all damage |
| **AoE Specialists** | Tag multiple enemies → mass status spread |

**Negative Synergies:**

| Situation | Issue |
|-----------|-------|
| **Fast-killing parties** | Targets die before Weaves trigger |
| **Disruption-heavy enemies** | Setup interrupted before execution |
| **Short encounters** | 3-action setup cost not worth it |
| **Solo play** | No allies to tag; limited weave options |

> *"The Bone-Setter heals one ally. With Shared Vigor, I make that heal affect two. The Thul terrifies one enemy. With Shared Misfortune, I make that Fear affect two. The Skjaldmær draws attacks. With Retribution, I make those attacks punish the attacker. I don't deal damage. I don't heal. I don't control directly. I make every other member of the party twice as effective. That is my value."*

### Situational Power Profile

| Condition | Effectiveness |
|-----------|---------------|
| **God-Tier** | Long boss fights; parties with strong controllers/healers; predictable enemy patterns |
| **Standard** | Mixed encounters with time to set up |
| **Weak** | Fast encounters; unpredictable enemies; solo play |
| **Useless** | Combat ends before Weaves activate |

---

## Lore Integration

### The Trikainen Heritage

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ancestry** | Descended from mythical three-armed Trikainen |
| **Perception** | Multi-threaded awareness of causal links and data flows |
| **Philosophy** | The Norns' loom is shattered; we write new code in the gaps |
| **Status** | Respected as brilliant; feared as heretics; valued for tactical genius |

The Norn-Spinners descend from the **Trikainen**—mythical beings said to have possessed three arms, allowing them to weave multiple threads of fate simultaneously. In the post-Glitch world, this lineage manifests as **multi-threaded perception**—the ability to see and manipulate the underlying causal code of reality.

> *"The old tales speak of the Norns—three sisters who wove fate upon a great loom. But the Great Glitch was the sound of that loom shattering. The threads are tangled now. The pattern is broken. The Trikainen descendants—we Norn-Spinners—do not try to repair the loom. We have learned to write code directly into the chaos. We are not weavers. We are programmers. And reality is our development environment."*

### The Norn-Spinner's Philosophy

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Code Over Fate** | Fate is broken; conditional logic is what remains |
| **Variables and Scripts** | Every entity is a variable; every effect is a function |
| **Calculated Heresy** | The Blight punishes intrusion, but control is worth the cost |

The Norn-Spinner's power is not magic—it is **programming**. They understand that reality now operates like a broken computer system, and they have learned to write scripts that execute within that system.

> *"The Skald speaks of 'narrative coherence.' The Örlög-bound speaks of 'probability manipulation.' These are metaphors. I speak in precise terms: variables, conditionals, scripts, execution. 'If X, then Y.' This is not poetry. This is logic. And in a world where logic is the rarest resource, I am very, very valuable."*

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Jötun-Readers** | Clinical fascination; "their multi-threaded perception could advance our research" |
| **Iron-Banes** | Grudging respect; "heretical methods, but undeniable tactical value" |
| **Örlög-bound** | Philosophical cousins; "they write code where we nudge variables" |
| **Coherent Mystics** | Concern; "their path leads to corruption, but their results are impressive" |
| **General Population** | Awe and fear; "fate-weavers who can link your pain to another's" |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the Age of Echoes, when the Great Glitch shattered the Norns' loom and left fate itself in tangled disarray, the Norn-Spinners emerged as heretical hope. Descended from the three-armed Trikainen, they possess a unique, multi-threaded perception of reality's broken code. They do not weave upon the shattered threads of destiny—they write new scripts into the chaos itself. Their magic is the art of conditional logic: 'If this ally bleeds, then that enemy bleeds.' They tag entities as variables, then link them with Weaves that create tangible cause-and-effect relationships across the battlefield. An ally's pain becomes an enemy's punishment. A healer's touch flows to a second wounded soul. A debuff on one foe spreads to another. At the height of their power, they can execute The Great Rewrite—seizing control of reality's master clock to pool all damage dealt or suffered and redistribute it according to their design. But this direct reality-editing is profound heresy. Every Weave stains their soul with Runic Blight Corruption. Every Scrying taxes their mind with Psychic Stress. They are scripters of a broken reality, trading their spiritual purity for tactical supremacy, writing elegant code in a virus-ridden system that punishes every intrusion. Their saga is a chronicle of perfect execution and spectacular system crashes—the story of those who dared to program fate itself."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Norn-Spinner (Causality Weaver) represents the high-skill-ceiling heretical Mystic specialization optimized for setup-and-payoff combo enabling. Mechanical role: strategic controller and force multiplier. Core mechanics: Causal Threads (variable tagging), Complex Weaving (conditional script execution), and Coherent Data (stable code resource). Key differentiator: only specialization with cause-and-effect linking between combatants; extreme setup cost (3+ actions) balanced by massive payoff when executed correctly. Signature ability: The Great Rewrite (once per combat, tags all combatants, then executes either damage pooling/redistribution or damage-taken revenge strike). Trauma Economy integration: High; every Weave inflicts Corruption, Scry the Flow inflicts Psychic Stress, capstone inflicts massive amounts of both. Social function: descended from Trikainen; multi-threaded perception; heretical programmer in a world of broken code. Optimal deployment: long boss encounters; parties with strong controllers/healers; players who enjoy complex strategic planning; synergy with any ally who deals damage, heals, or applies status effects."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Norn-Spinner (Causality Weaver). ARCHETYPE: Mystic. PATH TYPE: Heretical. ROLE: Causality Weaver / System Scripter / High-Skill Controller. PRIMARY STAT: WILL. SECONDARY STAT: WITS. RESOURCE: Aether Pool (AP) + Coherent Data (unique, max 3). CORE MECHANICS: Causal Threads (neutral status tags on entities), Complex Weaving (conditional if/then scripts linking tagged entities), Coherent Data (clean code fragments, generated via Scry/Efficient Code, spent for stable weaves). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Scripting): Code Perception (passive, +1d10 WITS checks magic/glitch, unlocks Coherent Data), Tag Variable (25 AP, apply Causal Thread 3 rounds, max 2), Simple Weave: Retribution (40 AP, ally damage → 50% Psychic to enemy). T2 (Advanced Weaving): Scry the Flow (30 AP, WILL check reveals enemy next action, +1 Coherent Data, +Psychic Stress), Simple Weave: Shared Vigor (45 AP + 1 CD, ally healing → 50% to other ally), Stable Compiler (passive, reduced Wild Magic Surge chance). T3 (Mastery of Causality): Complex Weave: Shared Misfortune (55 AP, enemy status effects spread to linked enemy), Efficient Code (passive, 3 max threads, Weave triggers may generate Coherent Data). CAPSTONE: The Great Rewrite (90 AP + all CD, once per combat, 1-turn chant, threads all combatants, then Harmonic Convergence [pool ally damage → Psychic to all enemies] OR Entropic Cascade [pool ally damage taken → single target revenge], massive Psychic Stress + Corruption). TRAUMA ECONOMY: High; Weaves = Corruption, Scry = Psychic Stress, Capstone = massive both."*

---

## Summary

The Norn-Spinner is the **scripter of a broken reality**.

They are heretical Mystics who have learned to write conditional code directly into the world's glitching operating system. Their Causal Threads tag entities as variables. Their Weaves create "if/then" statements that link the fates of allies and enemies. When an ally is struck, an enemy feels the pain. When an ally is healed, another ally shares the restoration. When an enemy is debuffed, another enemy shares the affliction.

Their gameplay is the highest-skill-ceiling in the game: three or more actions of setup before any payoff, but devastating results when executed correctly. They make tanks punish attackers. They make healers twice as efficient. They make controllers affect twice as many targets. They are the ultimate **force multiplier**.

This power comes at a cost. Every Weave injects foreign code into a system that punishes intrusion—Runic Blight Corruption stains their soul with every successful script. Every Scrying requires direct mental interface with Blighted logic—Psychic Stress accumulates with every glimpse of enemy intent. They walk the heretical path, trading spiritual purity for tactical supremacy.

The capstone The Great Rewrite represents the ultimate expression of their philosophy—the moment they cease to be users and become the system administrator, seizing control of reality's master clock to execute a single, grand causal function across the entire battlefield.
