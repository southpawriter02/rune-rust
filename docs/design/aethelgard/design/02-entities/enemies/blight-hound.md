# Blight-Hound

> *"You want to know about the Ash-Stalkers? Sit down, pup. And listen. First thing—you don't run. You never run. They feel your feet hitting the ground before you've taken three steps. Those crystal bones of theirs, they drink up every tremor. You run, they know exactly where you're going. And they don't eat you. Never seen one feed. They just... stop. Once you're down, once you're not moving anymore, they lose interest. That's the worst part. They don't even want you. You're just... a thing that was moving wrong."*

## 1. Overview

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Category** | Blight-Creature (Blight-Forged Fauna) |
| **Threat Tier** | Standard |
| **Origin** | Blight-Mutated / Vanir Bio-Asset |
| **Habitat** | Industrial Ruins, Abandoned Mining Complexes, Knuckle-Bone Fields Periphery |
| **Behavior** | Pack Hunter / Gradient-Seeker |
| **Pack Size** | 3-6 (loose aggregations) |

---

## 2. Lineage & Origin (Domain 5 Compliance)

### 2.1 Pre-Glitch Baseline

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Baseline Species** | Canis-Vigilax Pattern Tracker (CV-Series) |
| **Original Function** | Multi-purpose K9 service platform for search-and-rescue, security screening, and infrastructure diagnostics |
| **Era of Creation** | Age of Forging — bio-engineered by Vanir on the Vanaheim Deck; deployed across Yggdrasil Network |

### 2.2 Mutation Vector

| Vector | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Primary Cause** | Ginnungagap Glitch flooding Aetheric olfaction array with uniform, high-amplitude paradox noise; subsequent seven centuries of Runic Blight environmental saturation |
| **Visible Mutations** | Cachectic habitus (emaciated, starved appearance); crystalline ossification replacing cranium, spine, and forelimbs; dermal lesions with luminescent glyph-like striations; advanced mandibular polyptych (quad-mandible) for armored prey latching; atrophied optical organs |
| **Behavioral Changes** | Original discriminative filters collapsed into "World-Scent" syndrome; behavioral kernel reoriented toward elimination of paradox signal sources; pursuit generalized to any signal emitter (organic or synthetic); pack hunting replaces loyal companionship |

> **Domain 5 Note:** The Blight-Hound is not a natural species. It is the pathological endpoint of the CV-Series' Aetheric olfaction capability, overwhelmed by the Runic Blight and twisted into a compulsive null-hunt. Each specimen represents Blight-Forged Fauna—organisms achieving stable integration with Blight crystallization while retaining sufficient organic tissue to qualify as "alive." The Scriptorium classifies the Blight-Hound as the Type Specimen for this category.

## 3. Stat Block

### 3.1 Core Statistics

| Stat | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **HP** | 32 | Moderate for Standard tier; cachectic physiology |
| **Armor** | 2 | Crystalline bone protrusions (partial coverage) |
| **Speed** | Walk 6 / Sprint 8 | Fast and relentless; vibration-guided pursuit |
| **Initiative** | +2 | Heightened sensory response to movement |

### 3.2 Attributes

| Attribute | Value | Modifier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MIGHT** | 12 | +1 |
| **AGILITY** | 14 | +2 |
| **WITS** | 4 | -3 |
| **WILL** | 8 | -1 |
| **PRESENCE** | 6 | -2 |

### 3.3 Defenses

| Defense | Value | Save DC |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Physical** | 12 | DC 12 |
| **Mental** | 6 | DC 6 |
| **Aetheric** | 14 | DC 14 |

### 3.4 Resistances & Vulnerabilities

| Type | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Resistant** | Aetheric — crystalline integration absorbs Blight-based attacks |
| **Vulnerable** | Fire — ignites remaining organic tissue; Lightning — disrupts crystalline resonance |
| **Immune** | [Corrupted] — already Blight-saturated; [Feared] — no coherent self-preservation instinct |

---

## 4. Abilities

### 4.1 Basic Attack

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | Corrupting Bite |
| **Type** | Melee |
| **Range** | Adjacent |
| **Damage** | 2d6 + 1 — *Tier: Light d6* |
| **Effects** | On hit: Target must pass DC 12 WILL save or gain 1 Corruption (Blight vector saliva) |

**Resolution:** Roll AGILITY d10 vs target Physical Defense DC

### 4.2 Special Abilities

### Vibration Sense (Passive)

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Type** | Passive |
| **Trigger** | Any creature moves within 3 zones |
| **Effect** | Blight-Hound automatically detects movement regardless of visibility, stealth, or cover. Cannot be surprised by moving creatures. Ignores concealment penalties |
| **Cooldown** | None |

> **Aetheric Grounding (Domain 3):** The crystalline ossification in the Blight-Hound's skeletal structure conducts vibrations with terrifying precision—a corrupted echo of the CV-Series' original sensor fusion capabilities. Movement is "heard" through bone.
> 

### Aetheric Resonance Sense (Passive)

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Type** | Passive |
| **Trigger** | Creature with CPS symptoms, active Runic equipment, or Corruption ≥ 1 within 5 zones |
| **Effect** | Blight-Hound gains [Fixated] on target. +2 to all attack rolls against Fixated target. Will pursue Fixated target relentlessly, ignoring other threats unless attacked |
| **Cooldown** | None |

> **Aetheric Grounding (Domain 3):** The Aetheric olfaction array, though corrupted, still responds to high-noise gradients. Elevated CPS, leaking Undying, and corrupted artifacts register as the "strongest scents"—and must be silenced.
> 

### Pack Herding (Active)

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Type** | Active |
| **Trigger** | When 2+ Blight-Hounds are present; Standard action; 2-round cooldown |
| **Effect** | Coordinated movement forces target to pass DC 12 AGILITY save or be pushed 1 zone in a direction chosen by the pack. If pushed into hazardous terrain (Blight-zone, unstable floor, etc.), target immediately suffers terrain effects |
| **Cooldown** | 2 rounds |

> **Aetheric Grounding (Domain 3):** Despite neural degradation, pack coordination persists as a fragmented echo of the CV-Series' team-based search protocols—now twisted into tactical flanking and prey isolation.
> 

### Ash-Venting (Passive)

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Type** | Passive |
| **Trigger** | Blight-Hound is in the same zone as a target |
| **Effect** | Target must pass DC 10 WILL save at start of their turn or suffer -1 to all checks (Blight particulate contamination) until they leave the zone. Cumulative with multiple Blight-Hounds (max -3) |
| **Cooldown** | None |

> **Aetheric Grounding (Domain 3):** Respiration expels fine particulate matter carrying trace Blight contamination—hence the "Ash-Stalker" designation. Proximity is itself a hazard.
> 

### 4.3 Signature Ability (Elite Variant Only)

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | Paradox Howl |
| **Type** | Major action |
| **Effect** | The Alpha emits a keening harmonic associated with paradox gradients. All creatures within 2 zones must pass DC 14 WILL save or suffer 2d6 Aetheric damage and gain 1 Corruption. On failed save, creatures with existing Corruption are [Stunned] for 1 round. All Blight-Hounds in range gain +1 to attack rolls for 3 rounds |
| **Limitations** | Once per combat; affects allies (but Blight-Hounds are immune to Corruption) |

```

### 5.2 Tactical Notes

| Situation | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Opening** | Packs patrol loosely around Blight-saturated terrain; alert triggers on rapid movement or Aetheric resonance |
| **Grouped** | Two or more Hounds coordinate Pack Herding—one flanks while others drive prey toward hazardous ground |
| **High-Corruption Target** | Ignores all other threats to pursue Fixated target; will not disengage until target is down or removed from detection range |
| **Target Incapacitated** | Immediately loses interest once target stops moving; wanders away seeking new stimuli |
| **Fleeing** | Does not flee; fights until destroyed or stimulus removed |

### 5.3 Environmental Use

| Element | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| **Terrain** | Herds prey toward unstable floors, Blight-zones, and environmental hazards |
| **Ambush** | Does not ambush; relies on relentless pursuit rather than surprise |
| **Territory** | Crystalline deposits at territorial boundaries serve as warning markers (mild informational hazard) |
| **Blight Zones** | Thrives in high-Blight areas; cannot survive prolonged removal from Blight-saturated environment |

## 6. Encounter Design

### 6.1 Recommended Encounters

| Encounter Type | Composition | Challenge |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Easy** | 2 Blight-Hounds (dispersed, no pack tactics) | Low |
| **Medium** | 3-4 Blight-Hounds (coordinated pack) | Moderate |
| **Hard** | 5-6 Blight-Hounds (full pack with Pack Herding) | High |
| **Deadly** | 1 Blight-Hound Alpha (Elite) + 4 Standard + environmental Blight-zone | Extreme |

### 6.2 Synergies

| Paired With | Synergy Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Forlorn** | Forlorn's CPS aura attracts Blight-Hounds; creates pincer threat |
| **Blight-Zone Terrain** | Pack Herding pushes targets into Corruption-inducing terrain |
| **Undying (Leaking)** | Undying's Aetheric emissions draw Blight-Hound pack; chaotic multi-threat encounter |
| **Rust-Mites** | Mites weaken armor; Blight-Hounds apply Corruption to vulnerable targets |

### 6.3 Counter-Play

| Method | Effectiveness |
| --- | --- |
| **Stillness** | Freezing in place causes Blight-Hounds to lose tracking; must pass DC 14 WILL to remain motionless while pack investigates |
| **Fire-based attacks** | Ignites organic tissue; high damage and potential [Burning] |
| **Lightning-based attacks** | Disrupts crystalline resonance; chance to [Stun] |
| **Vibration discipline** | Soft boots and measured movement reduce detection range by 50% |
| **Aetheric shielding** | Shielded Runic equipment does not trigger Aetheric Resonance Sense |
| **Split party** | Pack cannot effectively herd if targets move in opposite directions |

## 9. Voice Guidance

### 9.1 Description Templates (Narrator Voice)

**First Sighting:**

> "The shadows shift wrong. Something moves at the edge of the rubble—lean and low, ribs visible through mottled hide. Its skull is all wrong, faceted with crystalline growths where eyes should be. It doesn't look at you. It doesn't need to. Its head tilts, and you realize with sick certainty that it's listening to your heartbeat through the stone."
> 

**In Combat:**

> "The Blight-Hound lunges with a speed that belies its emaciated frame, jaws splitting into four mandibles that lock onto armor with grinding precision. Where its teeth pierce flesh, you feel something else—a cold seeping wrongness, a whisper of static behind your eyes. The creature's breath washes over you: ash and ozone and something older. Something that was never meant to be smelled."
> 

**Death:**

> "The Blight-Hound collapses mid-stride, crystalline bones shattering where they strike stone. For a moment, the glyph-like lesions on its hide pulse brighter—a last transmission to nowhere—then fade to dull grey. The ash-breath rattles once and stops. It was never really alive. Just something that forgot how to stop moving."
> 

**Pack Sighting:**

> "They emerge from the ruins in eerie silence—three, then four, then more. Their movements are synchronized in ways that make your skin crawl, heads tilting in unison as if receiving the same broken signal. They don't charge. They fan out. They're not hunting you. They're herding you."
> 

### 9.2 Vocabulary Rules (Domain 4 Compliance)

| Concept | ❌ Avoid | ✅ Use Instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creature origin | "mutated by radiation" | "twisted by the paradox-scent of the Glitch" |
| Sensory ability | "echolocation," "sonar" | "vibration-sense," "bone-listening" |
| Crystalline parts | "crystal armor," "mineral growth" | "Blight-bone," "ossified paradox" |
| Pack behavior | "hive mind," "telepathy" | "broken-signal coordination," "echo of old protocols" |
| Corruption effect | "infection," "disease" | "the creeping wrongness," "the Blight's kiss" |

### 9.3 Sound Design Notes

| Event | Sound Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Idle** | Ragged, asthmatic breathing; faint crystalline chime when moving; ash particles settling |
| **Alert** | Sharp intake of breath; low subsonic vibration (felt more than heard) |
| **Attack** | Wet snap of mandibles; grinding of crystal-on-metal; victim's cry distorting into static |
| **Pack Coordination** | Overlapping wheezes syncing into rhythm; crystalline resonance harmonics |
| **Death** | Shattering glass; dying wheeze; static crackle fading to silence |

## 11. Phased Implementation Guide

### Phase 1: Data & Persistence

- [ ]  **Define Entity**: Create `EnemyType` entity for Blight-Hound with base stats, behavior flags, and category tags.
- [ ]  **Seed Data**: Add Blight-Hound (Standard), Blight-Hound Alpha (Elite), Juvenile (Minion), Blight-Saturated (Variant), and Den Mother (Boss) to `EnemyTypes` table in `DataSeeder.cs`.
- [ ]  **Validation**: Verify `Threat Tier` = Standard, `Category` = Blight-Creature matches Domain rules.

### Phase 2: Core Logic

- [ ]  **Stat Block**: Implement `BlightHoundStats` value object with HP 32, Armor 2, Speed 6.
- [ ]  **Abilities**: Implement `IAbility` strategy classes:
    - `CorruptingBiteAbility` (basic attack with Corruption application)
    - `VibrationSenseAbility` (passive detection)
    - `AethericResonanceSenseAbility` (passive Fixation trigger)
    - `PackHerdingAbility` (active forced movement)
    - `AshVentingAbility` (passive zone debuff)
    - `ParadoxHowlAbility` (Elite signature)
- [ ]  **AI State Machine**: Define states in `BlightHoundAI.cs`:
    - `Patrol` → `Alert` (on movement/Aetheric detection)
    - `Alert` → `Fixate` (high-gradient target) or `Pursue` (standard)
    - `Pursue` → `PackHerd` (if pack size ≥ 2) or `Attack` (solo)
    - `TargetDown` → `Disengage` (lose interest; seek new stimulus)
- [ ]  **Unit Tests**: Verify Fixation priority; test Pack Herding forced movement; test Corruption application.

### Phase 3: Systems Integration

- [ ]  **Spawn Rules**: Add to `EncounterTable` for Blight-saturated zones, Industrial Ruins, Knuckle-Bone Fields periphery.
- [ ]  **Combat Engine**: Register `BlightHoundAI` with `TurnOrderService`; implement pack coordination logic.
- [ ]  **Loot**: Connect `BlightHoundDropTable` to `LootService`; implement harvesting DCs and Corruption fumble risk.

### Phase 4: UI & Feedback

- [ ]  **Logs**: Detailed AI decision logs (Fixation triggers, Pack Herding coordination, Corruption applications).
- [ ]  **TUI**: "A Blight-Hound pack emerges from the ash..." notification; combat log flavor text for Corruption.
- [ ]  **GUI**: Assign model/sprite; implement ash-venting particle effect; crystalline glow pulsing; Pack Herding visualization.

## 15. Changelog

| Version | Date | Changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0 | 2025-12-29 | Initial specification; synthesized from v2.0, v4.0, v5.0 sources |

---

This specification is ready for review. The Blight-Hound is designed as a pack-based threat emphasizing Corruption mechanics and relentless pursuit—a corrupted service animal whose greatest gift (Aetheric olfaction) became its curse. It synergizes with environmental Blight-zones and rewards parties that practice vibration discipline while punishing those who run or carry high Corruption loads. The creature's unique "loss of interest" behavior when targets stop moving provides tactical counterplay while reinforcing the horror of being hunted by something that doesn't even want you—just wants you to stop moving wrong.
