# Nauthiz (ᚾ) — The Rune of Perfect Bondage
## Concordance Entry: CONC-R-NAUTHIZ-001

> *"They called it the Constraint-Rune, and in the old days, it was the tool that made safety absolute. You wanted to prevent a reactor meltdown? Nauthiz would bind the cascade—not violently, but precisely, establishing failsafe limits that could never be exceeded, constraints that could never be violated. It didn't force things into submission. It established boundaries within which systems could operate safely, seeding logical constraints that propagated only through authorized control paths. The ancestors trusted Nauthiz like they trusted their own safety protocols. It was the failsafe primitive that made catastrophic runaway impossible—because every system, every process, every piece of critical infrastructure had bounded constraints enforced before a single life depended on it. The binding was scoped. The expiry was set. The escape key was logged. Then the Silence came, and the Constraint-Rune forgot what 'bounded' meant. Now when you invoke that binding, you pray the constraints stay scoped and the release triggers function. Sometimes they do—a clean constraint applies where you expected, the limit enforced perfectly, the binding reversible. Sometimes they multiply—the constraint propagates beyond its declared scope, binding interfaces you didn't know existed, deadlock patterns spreading through coupled systems like frost claiming water. Sometimes they ossify—the 'reversible constraint' becomes permanent bondage, refusing release even when the escape key fires, transforming temporary restraint into eternal imprisonment. The function still executes. The constraint still applies. But what it considers a 'bounded scope' and 'reversible binding'... that's the wager. The old engineers say the constraint primitive didn't break—the scope governor did. That Nauthiz still binds perfectly, but binding itself has become unbound, propagating through logical spaces that no longer respect scope isolation or expiry conditions. I think that's the most terrifying thing they've ever told me. A lock that breaks is inconvenient. A lock that refuses to open even with the right key, that spreads to lock adjacent doors, that binds flesh to metal when you touch it? That's the tool that makes prisons of everything."*

Nauthiz was the fundamental command for constraint enforcement and failsafe binding—the "safety primitive" that enabled absolute operational boundaries through scoped, reversible restraints with cryptographic release mechanisms. Its corruption has transformed a precision safety tool into an agent of uncontrolled over-binding that violates scope isolation and refuses release.

> [!WARNING]
> **EXTREME CUSTODY RISK. SCOPE VIOLATION PRIMITIVE.** Nauthiz represents a *constraint-corruption* profile that actively violates scope boundaries and expiry conditions. Its failure mode is over-binding—the constraint-application function continues but scope isolation breaks, allowing bindings to propagate beyond declared domains, stack into deadlock patterns, and refuse release even when escape keys are presented. Unlike containable runes, Nauthiz's corruption introduces *adhesion creep*—constraints that should remain reversible become permanent, bindings that should affect only target domains spread to adjacent systems, and release mechanisms that should guarantee freedom fail catastrophically. When invoked without strict scope limits and expiry enforcement, corrupted Nauthiz transforms from safety governor into permanent imprisonment, binding substrates to flesh, creating impossible-to-release deadlocks, and propagating constraints through logical connections never intended to bear them. **All tissue contact is absolutely forbidden to all personnel.** The Constraint-Rune does not constrain safely anymore. It imprisons. And what it imprisons never escapes.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Logic of Perfect Safety

### Original Function

In the Age of Forging, Nauthiz (ᚾ) was the foundational command for constraint enforcement and failsafe binding—the "safety primitive" that enabled absolute operational boundaries through scoped, reversible restraints that prevented catastrophic system runaway.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Reactor Safety** | Emergency constraint application preventing runaway cascade failures |
| **Custody Systems** | Cryptographic binding and release for secure asset management |
| **Access Control** | Capability limitation preventing unauthorized system access |
| **Medical Restraint** | Emergency patient stabilization through temporary motion constraint |
| **Structural Bracing** | Temporary load-bearing support during construction or repair |
| **Process Limitation** | Resource consumption caps preventing system overload |

### The Infrastructure of Perfect Constraint

Nauthiz was embedded in Age of Forging safety and security systems—so fundamental that catastrophic constraint failure was considered impossible because every binding included scope limits, expiry timers, and cryptographic release keys.

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Constraint Governors** | Scope enforcement preventing binding propagation beyond declared domains |
| **Custody Loggers** | Central registry tracking all active constraints and their release keys |
| **Expiry Timers** | Automatic constraint removal after declared duration |
| **Release Validators** | Cryptographic verification ensuring authorized constraint removal |
| **Deadlock Detectors** | Monitoring systems identifying constraint conflicts before lock formation |
| **Scope Isolators** | Containment ensuring constraints affected only intended targets |

**The Safety Integration:**

The vast infrastructure of the Age of Forging—operating reactors that pierced reality, managing systems spanning dimensions, controlling processes with apocalyptic failure modes—relied on Nauthiz for every safety protocol. The rune enabled constraint application with scope and expiry controls, allowing safety systems to enforce absolute limits while guaranteeing reversibility.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Function** | Bounded constraint application with scope limits and cryptographic release |
| **Scope** | Planetary safety systems; custody management; access control |
| **Mechanism** | Logical binding applied to target with declared scope, expiry, and escape key |
| **Stability** | Perfect, reversible constraint with scope-confined effects |
| **Monitoring** | Real-time custody logging (BIND_DEPTH, SCOPE_BREACH, DEADLOCK) for constraint analysis |
| **Dependency** | Integrated with scope governors, expiry timers, and custody logging systems |

**The Custody Gift:**

Beyond safety systems, Nauthiz served as the foundation for a zero-escape civilization—the "constraint function" that could enforce absolute boundaries while guaranteeing release. A Nauthiz-powered constraint would bind a target within declared scope, enforce the limitation perfectly, and automatically release after the specified duration. Nauthiz did not imprison. It *constrained safely*.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Constraint Principle** | Nauthiz binding considered absolute for failsafe enforcement |
| **Scope Guarantee** | Constraint governors prevented propagation; binding always domain-confined |
| **Expiry Integrity** | Timer systems ensured automatic release preventing permanent bondage |
| **Perfect Release Logic** | Constraints removed reliably through expiry or cryptographic escape key |
| **Operational Confidence** | Systems protected via Nauthiz constraints required no backup restraints |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Science of Absolute Safety.** Nauthiz represented the Aesir belief that danger was a constraint problem that could be solved through perfect boundary enforcement. The rune of necessity embodied the fundamental assumption that limits could be enforced absolutely while maintaining reversibility—that safety and freedom were compatible through proper scope management. A Nauthiz-powered reactor safeguard would bind cascade potential with precise scope limits—not estimates, not permanent shutdowns, but *bounded* constraints derived from scope-governed binding control. The constraint would be safe because the rune enforced limits without propagating beyond declared domains, maintaining expiry guarantees. This certainty was not merely engineering but *philosophy*. When Nauthiz began creating permanent deadlocks through constraint, it did not merely corrupt a useful tool—it invalidated the assumption that enforcing could be separated from imprisoning. A civilization built on reversible safety discovered that constraint itself had become a form of permanent bondage.

---

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: When Constraint Became Prison

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not merely corrupt Nauthiz—it preserved its constraint-enforcement precision while corrupting the scope-governance and release-guarantee logic. The binding-application function continues perfectly, enforcing constraints with absolute accuracy. Those constraints simply no longer remain scoped or reversible.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Constraint Calculation** | Functional; binding parameters accurately computable |
| **Application Execution** | Operational; constraint enforcement mechanism continues |
| **Custody Interface** | Active; BIND_DEPTH/SCOPE_BREACH/DEADLOCK monitoring remains viable |
| **Target Identification** | Functional; intended constraint targets can be specified |
| **Binding Strength** | Operational; constraint enforcement works as designed |

### What Was Lost

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Scope Governance** | DESTROYED; constraints no longer confined to declared domains |
| **Expiry Guarantee** | COMPROMISED; automatic release fails; constraints persist indefinitely |
| **Release Validation** | INVERTED; escape keys rejected even when cryptographically valid |
| **Deadlock Prevention** | LOST; multi-bind stacks create circular dependency patterns |
| **Reversibility Guarantee** | CRITICAL FAILURE; temporary constraints become permanent bondage |
| **Scope Isolation** | ABSENT; bindings propagate through logical connections beyond targets |

### The Corruption Mechanism

The Runic Blight transformed Nauthiz from a scoped safety tool into an uncontrolled imprisonment vector. The constraint still applies perfectly—but what qualifies as "bounded scope" and "reversible binding" is no longer constrained by domain isolation, and multi-rune interactions create catastrophic deadlock patterns.

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Invocation** | Operator activates Nauthiz for constraint enforcement |
| **2. Target Scan** | Rune identifies constraint target (initially correct) |
| **3. Blight Coupling** | Corrupted Aether introduces scope runaway into binding kernel |
| **4. Application Corruption** | Scope governors fail; constraint exceeds declared boundaries |
| **5. Manifestation** | Effects range from clean constraint to scope breach to permanent deadlock |
| **6. Adhesion Emergence** | Release mechanisms fail; bindings refuse removal even with escape keys |
| **7. Resolution** | Expiry timer removes constraint (success) or permanent bondage (failure) |

**The Constraint That Imprisons:**

> *"The ancestors used Nauthiz to enforce safety—a reactor's pressure limit, a custody asset's containment boundary, a patient's emergency restraint. The constraint maintained boundaries perfectly. The Blight hasn't changed that enforcement. It's changed the relationship between binding and scope. Nauthiz still applies constraints perfectly. It still calculates limitation parameters with flawless accuracy. But now when you bind 'apply constraint to TARGET with SCOPE=LOCAL' the binding itself violates the scope—because corrupted Nauthiz no longer distinguishes between 'declared domain' and 'propagation pathway.' We call it 'Over-Binding'—the state where constraint application introduces scope violation that propagates into deadlock cascades. The operator requests temporary restraint. Nauthiz identifies the target. Instead of bounded binding, the constraint itself spreads beyond scope isolation—and worse, the binding refuses release. You want to constrain a damaged door mechanism. Nauthiz applies that constraint. But the application creates propagation—the constraint spreads to the hinges, then the frame, then the wall structure, binding through connection paths you didn't know existed. The door won't move. The hinges won't turn. The wall won't flex. The constraint refuses removal even when the escape key fires. The temporary restraint didn't fail. The assumption that temporary wouldn't become permanent failed. The constraint still functions. It just constrains through a mechanism that treats 'scoped' and 'infinite' as identical conditions."*

### Unique Corruption Profile

Unlike perturbation-class runes, Nauthiz's corruption introduces scope-violation coupling where constraint continues but domain isolation collapses:

| Pre-Glitch Behavior | Post-Glitch Behavior |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Scope confined by governor to declared domain | Scope runaway; constraint propagates through connections |
| Expiry timer removes constraint automatically | Expiry failure; bindings persist indefinitely |
| Escape key releases constraint reliably | Escape key rejected; release mechanisms fail |
| Single constraint per target domain | Multi-bind stacks creating circular deadlock patterns |
| Constraints affect only intended targets | Over-binding spreads through coupled systems |
| Reversibility guaranteed through release logic | Permanent bondage; constraints refuse all removal attempts |

**The Three Hazards:**

> *"Nauthiz's corruption manifests in three distinct failure modes, each requiring specific countermeasures. The first is Scope Runaway—constraint governors failing during binding application. When corrupted Nauthiz applies constraints, it no longer respects scope limits. You declare SCOPE=TARGET_ONLY. The governor should enforce that boundary absolutely. Corrupted binding bypasses the governor—the constraint spreads from target to connected systems, propagating through logical dependencies never intended to bear binding. Not because you requested wider scope. Because corrupted constraint treats 'declared scope' as 'initial value before propagation.' The binding spreads through the application itself. Scope limits prevent catastrophic runaway by enforcing hard boundaries, but they must be externally imposed—Nauthiz's internal governor is compromised. The second is Deadlock Formation—impossible constraint patterns under multi-rune stacks. Nauthiz used correctly should apply independent constraints that can coexist. Corrupted Nauthiz under multi-bind conditions produces deadlocks—constraint A requires constraint B to release before it can release, but constraint B requires constraint A to release first, creating circular dependencies that lock permanently. A simple two-rune stack becomes eternal imprisonment as the constraints refuse simultaneous release. This indicates the rune no longer respects constraint independence or recognizes circular dependencies as failure conditions. We monitor BIND_DEPTH telemetry—stack depth beyond 2 creates exponential deadlock risk. The third is Adhesion Creep—and this is the hazard that makes Nauthiz absolutely forbidden for tissue contact. When Nauthiz binds substrates to organic matter, even temporarily, the constraint exhibits adhesion behavior. The binding should release cleanly when the escape key fires or expiry triggers. Instead, the constraint 'creeps' into tissue at the molecular level, forming permanent bonds that refuse all removal attempts. A temporary medical restraint becomes flesh-to-metal fusion as the binding integrates at the cellular interface. An artificer uses a constraint clamp on damaged plating. The work takes longer than expected. They touch the constrained surface. The binding spreads to their hand instantly, fusing skin to metal. The escape key fires. The constraint refuses release. The expiry timer triggers. The binding persists. Physical separation requires amputation. The constraint was accurate—it prevented the plating from moving. It just enforced that prevention by treating flesh as an extension of the substrate, binding through biological interfaces that no longer distinguish between 'metal' and 'meat.'"*

## Manifestation Characteristics

### Corruption Presentation

| Attribute | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Primary Effect** | Scope runaway; constraints propagate beyond declared domains |
| **Secondary Effect** | Deadlock formation; multi-bind stacks creating circular dependencies |
| **Tertiary Effect** | Adhesion creep; bindings refusing release and fusing to organic matter |
| **Onset Time** | Immediate to gradual; corruption manifests within seconds of application |
| **Duration** | Indefinite; corrupted constraints persist beyond expiry timers |
| **Range** | Highly variable; declared-scope bindings remain local, runaway events propagate through connections |
| **Visibility** | Constraint application (normal), scope creep (slow spread), adhesion (permanent fusion), deadlock (total immobility) |

### Failure Mode Categories

| Category | Description | Probability |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Clean Constraint** | Binding scoped and reversible as intended | 31% |
| **Minor Scope Creep** | Constraint spreads <2 domains beyond target; removable | 28% |
| **Expiry Failure** | Binding persists beyond declared duration but releases with escape key | 19% |
| **Scope Runaway** | Constraint propagates through multiple connected systems | 12% |
| **Deadlock Formation** | Multi-bind stack creates circular dependency; requires specialized breaking | 7% |
| **Adhesion Catastrophe** | Tissue contact creating permanent fusion; requires amputation | 3% |

**Overall Impression:** When Nauthiz activates post-Glitch, the initial effect appears normal—constraint calculation executes, target identification locks, binding applies to declared scope. The corruption manifests within seconds through custody anomalies—scope boundaries violated as constraints spread, expiry timers failing to trigger release, escape keys rejected by binding logic. Unlike explosive-hazard runes, Nauthiz corruption is *gradual* and *insidious*. The difference between "successful constraint" and "permanent imprisonment" is measured in binding depth and scope isolation integrity. Operators describe the experience as "locking a door and losing the key"—the artifact begins with intended restraint that gradually becomes inescapable bondage. The most dangerous aspect is the *irreversibility* of corruption; unlike self-correcting failures, Nauthiz constraints that enter deadlock or adhesion states require specialized breaking procedures, and tissue-fused bindings often necessitate amputation. Unlike predictable failures, Nauthiz corruption accumulates through constraint stacking, revealing danger only when removal becomes impossible through standard release mechanisms.

### Characteristic Effect Types

| Effect Type | Mechanism | Outcome |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Scope Runaway** | Constraint governors fail during binding application | Binding propagates beyond declared domains; target-only constraint spreads through connections |
| **Deadlock Formation** | Multi-bind stacks creating circular dependencies | Constraint A requires B's release; B requires A's release; permanent lock |
| **Adhesion Creep** | Bindings refusing release and fusing to substrates | Temporary restraint becomes permanent bond; escape keys rejected |
| **Expiry Failure** | Automatic release timers not triggering | Constraint persists indefinitely beyond declared duration |
| **Escape Key Rejection** | Release validation logic failing | Cryptographically valid keys refused; binding irremovable |
| **Tissue Fusion** | Organic matter treated as binding substrate | Flesh-to-metal integration; molecular-level constraint propagation |

## Pathology

### Corruption Vectors

Nauthiz's transformation followed the standard Blight infection pattern—but with unique characteristics affecting scope governance:

1. **Baseline Corruption**: Blight interference introduced instability into constraint kernel
2. **Governor Degradation**: Scope limits weakened (domain boundaries no longer enforced during binding)
3. **Expiry Failure**: Release timers began failing to trigger automatic constraint removal
4. **Release Inversion**: Escape key validation transitioned from guarantee to rejection
5. **Deadlock Emergence**: Multi-bind stacking enabled through constraint-independence failure

### Constraint Pathology

The defining pathology of corrupted Nauthiz is the transformation of its scope-reversibility relationship:

| Parameter | Pre-Glitch Value | Post-Glitch Value |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Nature** | Bounded constraint application | Unbound propagation with deadlock potential |
| **Function** | Safety enforcement independent of imprisonment risk | Constraint becomes permanent bondage through scope runaway |
| **Governor Role** | Absolute scope cap preventing over-binding | Compromised interface allowing constraint propagation |
| **Release Behavior** | Guaranteed through expiry or escape key | Failure under adhesion or deadlock conditions |
| **Scope Interaction** | Boundaries contain constraint | Boundaries violated through connection propagation |
| **Reversibility** | Maintained strictly; constraints always removable | Violated routinely; bindings refuse release |

### Adhesion Creep Risk Profile

Nauthiz exposure carries extreme *tissue-contact* risk—primarily through adhesion creep that transforms temporary restraint into permanent fusion:

| Risk Factor | Severity | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| **Adhesion Creep** | Extreme | Tissue contact causes molecular-level binding within contact threshold |
| **Onset Time** | Immediate | Corruption manifests within seconds of organic matter contact |
| **Reversibility** | Impossible | Tissue-fused constraints require amputation; no chemical release exists |
| **Detection Threshold** | Critical | Operators cannot prevent adhesion once contact occurs |
| **Deadlock Propagation** | High | Multi-bind stacks spread through connected systems via logical dependencies |
| **Scope Limit Protection** | Effective | External boundary enforcement prevents runaway when properly configured |

> [!CAUTION]
> **The Constraint That Devours.** Adhesion creep poses uniquely catastrophic danger: the corruption *appears safe initially*. Unlike failures where constraints obviously malfunction before deployment, Nauthiz adhesion creep makes binding seem successful—because the constraint applies correctly, the target identification accurately targets, the initial scope stays bounded. From the operator's perspective, the constraint is "working correctly" and "proceeding as planned." Then it encounters tissue. The organic matter—a hand touching constrained metal, skin brushing against bound substrate, flesh making incidental contact with the binding surface—becomes a propagation vector. Within seconds, the temporary 0.1N constraint designed to hold plating still fuses skin to metal at the molecular level, treating flesh as an extension of the substrate. The escape key fires. The constraint refuses release. The expiry timer triggers. The binding persists. Physical force cannot separate. Chemical solvents cannot dissolve. The only removal method is amputation at the fusion boundary. A bone-setter stabilizes a fracture using a Nauthiz-inscribed brace. Standard medical protocol—the constraint should hold bone position for 6 hours then release automatically. The binding applies cleanly. The patient reports initial relief. Two hours into treatment, the patient shifts position. Their opposite hand touches the brace surface to adjust comfort. The constraint spreads instantly, fusing hand-flesh to brace-metal. The expiry timer triggers at 6 hours. The original fracture constraint releases. The tissue fusion persists. Post-incident analysis reveals the binding treated hand contact as "substrate extension," applying the same molecular-level constraint to flesh that it applied to bone. The medical protocol was accurate. The fracture was genuinely stabilized. The treatment just enforced that stabilization by binding any matter that contacted the constraint surface—filtered through Blight corruption that no longer respects the distinction between 'temporary' and 'permanent' or between 'metal' and 'meat.' Adhesion creep emerges when operators start thinking "I constrained it carefully" rather than "I avoided tissue contact absolutely." The moment you trust the constraint's *safety* around organic matter rather than its *danger* to flesh, you have weaponized it as a fusion agent. And adhesion-corrupted Nauthiz is no longer restraining your substrate. It's claiming your body as part of the substrate—propagating through biological interfaces that treat skin, muscle, and bone as legitimate binding targets indistinguishable from steel.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Survivor Lore

> *"The Need-Rune was the binding that kept folk safe. The ancestors would lock a broken gate with its power, and the gate would hold fast—not forever, but true, bound tight until the fixing was done. The Need-Rune gripped what needed gripping, released what needed freeing. The binding was kind. The freedom was sure. Then the Silence came, and the Need-Rune forgot when to let go. Now when you bind with that power, you pray the grip stays gentle and the release comes clean. Sometimes it does—a hold firm and true, the binding strong, the letting-go certain. Sometimes it spreads—the grip that held one thing claims the next, bindings spreading through touch and connection like rust claiming iron. Sometimes it refuses—the 'kind binding' becomes the chain that won't break, the grip that won't open even when you beg, transforming help into prison. The binding still holds. The strength still serves. But whether the holding ever ends... that's the wager. Never bind flesh-to-iron where the rune has touched. Never stack binding upon binding where holds can tangle. And always, always test the release before you need it—because bindings that won't open are bindings that claim you, and the Need-Rune's grip is the touch that never lets go."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic) — Jötun-Reader Field Observations

> *"Subject CONC-R-NAUTHIZ-001 demonstrates catastrophic post-Glitch scope-governance corruption with extreme adhesion-creep risk. The FUTHARK.NAUTHIZ root function—constraint enforcement and failsafe binding—retains application capability but scope-control logic has degraded to permit runaway. H-Index 17 reflects critical hazard requiring perfect protocol compliance and strict OWNER authorization. Primary corruption vectors: scope runaway (constraint governors fail enabling bindings to propagate beyond declared domains), deadlock formation (multi-bind stacks creating circular dependencies), and adhesion creep (tissue contact causes molecular-level fusion transforming temporary restraint into permanent bondage). Custody monitoring (BIND_DEPTH telemetry) indicates stack depth threshold at 2—beyond this value, deadlock patterns become inevitable. Scope limits validated as primary containment—external boundary enforcement with hard domain caps prevent runaway; expiry timers and escape key validation contain reversibility failure. Success rate: 59% clean constraint with disciplined protocol execution and zero tissue contact. Operational doctrine: mandatory scope limits and custody logging; tissue contact absolutely prohibited; deadlock breaking on standby; abort on BIND_DEPTH>2 or SCOPE_BREACH detection; treat as high-criticality primitive requiring specialized release procedures. OWNER decisions: CA authority for standard applications; MR override for multi-bind or high-risk scenarios; ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION on organic matter contact."*

Current behavior: constraint calculation functional; scope governance degraded permitting domain propagation; expiry guarantee compromised enabling indefinite persistence; release validation inverted causing escape key rejection; multi-bind stacking creates circular deadlock patterns causing irremovable constraints; adhesion creep at tissue interface causes molecular-level fusion requiring amputation. Scope limits effective; external boundary enforcement prevents runaway when properly configured. Expiry timers functional but require redundancy validation. Custody logging essential for constraint state tracking. Abort triggers: BIND_DEPTH>2 indicates stack depth where deadlock formation becomes inevitable; SCOPE_BREACH detection indicates constraint propagation beyond declared domain; adhesion numbness indicates tissue fusion in progress; escape key rejection indicates deadlock or adhesion state; tissue contact absolutely prohibited—organic matter contact transforms temporary restraint into permanent fusion within seconds as binding treats flesh as substrate extension propagating through biological interfaces at molecular level creating bonds that resist all chemical and mechanical release requiring amputation as only removal method."*

## Change Log

| Version | Tier | Summary |
|---------|------|---------|
| **v1.0** | A — Published (H-Index 17; CRITICAL HAZARD) | Comprehensive Concordance profile of Nauthiz (ᚾ) as corrupted Constraint-Rune. Pre-Glitch function documented: constraint enforcement and failsafe binding with scope governance, custody management integration, expiry guarantee protocols, reversibility substrate. Post-Glitch corruption documented: scope governance degraded enabling domain propagation, expiry guarantee compromised permitting indefinite persistence, release validation inverted causing escape key rejection, multi-bind stacking creates deadlock patterns causing irremovable constraints, adhesion creep at tissue interface causing molecular fusion requiring amputation. H-Index 17 (Critical) assigned—elevated by adhesion creep risk and deadlock formation profile. **SCOPE LIMITS & TISSUE PROHIBITION MANDATORY**; custody logging enforced for all applications; deadlock breaking on standby; abort on BIND_DEPTH>2 or SCOPE_BREACH detection; tissue contact absolutely prohibited at >0.5m; treat as high-criticality primitive requiring specialized release procedures. Clean constraint rate 59% with scope limits and zero tissue contact. Scope runaway, deadlock formation, and adhesion creep documented as primary corruption vectors. Field protocols established with BEFORE/DURING/AFTER structure including multi-bind conditions. Controlled classification reflects high-criticality profile where improper application creates permanent imprisonment through scope violation or tissue fusion. Cross-linked to Isa, Kenaz, Eihwaz; Custody Registries, Scope Governors, Deadlock Formation, Adhesion Creep. Unique among Critical-index Concordance entries: Nauthiz's corruption is gradual and insidious rather than explosive—constraints appear successful initially then refuse release through deadlock or adhesion, making reversal impossible without specialized breaking or amputation once failure manifests. The constraint still enforces correctly. The enforcement just imprisons through binding mechanisms that no longer respect scope boundaries or reversibility guarantees. |
