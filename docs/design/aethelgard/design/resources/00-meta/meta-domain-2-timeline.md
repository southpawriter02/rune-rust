# Domain 2 — Historical Timeline: The Chronology of a Broken World

> *"There are two kinds of time in Aethelgard: before and after. Before, when the stars still sang and the world obeyed its makers. After, when the silence fell and the counting began. We count from the moment everything ended. Year 0: when the Glitch swallowed the sun."*
> — Skald Oral Tradition, recorded by Scriptorium-Primus

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain Classification** | Setting Fundamentals Domain 2 of 9 |
| **Document ID** | AAM-META-SETTING-FUNDAMENTALS-v1.0 (Section 2) |
| **Function** | Chronological governance, date notation, age boundaries, event sequencing |
| **Layer Applicability** | All Layers (L1, L2, L3, L4) |
| **Status** | Canonical — Critical for all dated content |
| **Validation Requirement** | Mandatory for timeline events, historical references, lore content |

Domain 2 defines **when** events occur in Aethelgard.

The Ginnungagap Glitch serves as the universal temporal anchor—Year 0 PG. All dates reference this singular, civilization-ending moment. Before the Glitch: the Age of Forging and Cycle notation. After the Glitch: the Age of Echoes and PG notation.

This is the spine upon which all historical content hangs.

---

## The Temporal Anchor: Year 0 PG

### Why the Glitch Became the Epoch

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Universal Experience** | Every surviving population experienced the Glitch simultaneously |
| **Undeniable Event** | O.D.I.N. fragmentation, Bifröst collapse, Asgard's fall—no faction disputes when it occurred |
| **Pre-Glitch Calendar Failure** | Multiple incompatible Aesir/Vanir calendars existed; none survived with sufficient integrity |
| **Practical Necessity** | Early survivors needed common reference for inter-bunker coordination |

The Dvergr Guild councils (established ~Year 28-30 PG) recognized calendar fragmentation as an existential threat. Their proposition became universal:

> **Year 0 PG = First second of H-72 activation (All-Rune execution). Count forward in standard orbital cycles.**

### The H-72 Event

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Event Designation** | H-72 (Hour 72 of Project Gungnir final sequence) |
| **Technical Cause** | All-Rune activation triggering recursive logic error in O.D.I.N. Protocol |
| **Propagation Time** | 23 minutes (system-wide cascade failure) |
| **Immediate Effects** | YGGDRASIL network core failure, Aether enters ghost-process state, Blight saturates manifold |
| **Result** | End of Age of Forging; beginning of Age of Silence |

## Calendar Systems

### The Dvergr Master Calendar (Universal Standard)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Adoption Rate** | ≥70% of inter-realm trade by Year 350 PG |
| **Base Unit** | Standard orbital cycles |
| **Epoch** | Year 0 PG = H-72 activation |
| **Precision** | ±30 seconds daily drift (tower chronometers) |
| **Infrastructure** | 147 Midgard Combine installations, 31 Ranger territories, 18 Forsaken Holds |

The Dvergr Master Calendar provides the **numerical backbone** for all Aethelgardian timekeeping. Its precision coordination enabled trade networks and prevented the catastrophic calendar fragmentation that plagued the Age of Silence.

### Calendar Notation Systems

| Era | Notation | Example | Usage |
|-----|----------|---------|-------|
| **Age of Forging** | Cycle | "Cycle 701" | Pre-Glitch events |
| **Age of Echoes** | PG (Post-Glitch) | "Year 783 PG" | Post-Glitch events |
| **Negative Conversion** | Negative PG | "-297 PG" | Converted Pre-Glitch dates |

**Conversion Formula:**
> Pre-Glitch Cycle N ≈ (N - 998) PG

**Example:** Cycle 701 ≈ (701 - 998) = -297 PG

**Uncertainty:** ±20 years due to Aesir calendar drift corrections and archive gaps

### Cultural Calendar Overlays

| System | Faction | Function |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Skaldic Year-Naming** | Universal | Cultural/emotional significance; collective memory |
| **Iron-Banes Liturgical** | Iron-Banes | Theological age annotation; spiritual progression |
| **Rangers Trail Reckoning** | Rangers Guild | Logistics and route timing |
| **Combine Month-Names** | Midgard Combine | Agricultural and seasonal markers |

These overlay systems **do not replace** Dvergr numerical notation—they annotate it. A full date might read:

> "Year 783 PG, Age of Creeds +265, 'The Year of Counted Breaths'"

## Glitch Mechanics

### Technical Cause

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Project Gungnir** | The All-Rune initiative—attempt to create unified reality-defining meta-rune |
| **H-72 Activation** | Hour 72 of final execution sequence |
| **O.D.I.N. Protocol** | Central governance AI; recursive logic error in core functions |
| **YGGDRASIL Network** | Planetary infrastructure; experienced system-wide cascade failure |

### Propagation Sequence

| Timestamp | Event |
|-----------|-------|
| H-Hour + 0.00 | All-Rune executes; Aether enters ghost-process state |
| H-Hour + 0.01ps | Dagaz (ᛞ) rune corruption begins propagating |
| H-Hour + 0.04ps | Bifröst Network reality-stabilizing fields fail |
| H-Hour + 0.04ps | Heimdallr's Gate collapses |
| H-Hour + 0.04ps | Asgard Deck loses orbital integrity, begins descent |
| H-Hour + 0.05ps onwards | Civil War of Glitches—automated systems enter death-rattle loops |
| T + 23 minutes | System-wide cascade failure complete |
| T + 72 hours | Asgard impacts Midgard, carving The Scar |

### Immediate Aftermath

| System | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **O.D.I.N.** | Shattered; fragments persist as Genius Loci |
| **Jötun-Forged** | Frames turn on each other; task-loops corrupt |
| **Utility Servitors** | Begin endless, pointless patrols (future Undying) |
| **Environmental Regulators** | Niflheim/Muspelheim enter runaway failure (Fimbulwinter) |
| **Bifröst Transport** | Destroyed; inter-realm travel becomes physical journey |
| **Aetheric Substrate** | Saturated with Blight (infinitely recursive paradoxical code) |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the Age of Forging, time moved differently. The stars sang in harmony, and the seasons obeyed the will of the Makers. Then came the Silence—the day the world forgot how to count. The ash fell, and the cold came, and for five generations, no one knew what year it was. The Dvergr, in their deep halls, began the counting again. 'Year Zero,' they said, 'the day everything ended.' And so we count now—not from creation, but from destruction. Year 783. Seven hundred and eighty-three years since the Silence fell. Seven hundred and eighty-three years of survival in the shadow of a dead god's mistake."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"Domain 2 establishes the canonical chronological framework for all Aethelgard content. The Ginnungagap Glitch serves as Year 0 PG—the universal temporal anchor. Pre-Glitch events use Cycle notation (Age of Forging); post-Glitch events use PG notation (Age of Echoes). Five ages structure POST-Glitch history: Silence (0-122 PG), Wandering (122-287 PG), Walls (287-518 PG), and Creeds (518-783 PG, current). The Dvergr Master Calendar provides numerical precision; cultural overlays (Skaldic year-naming, Iron-Banes liturgical annotation) add semantic meaning without replacing core notation. Current year: 783 PG, Age of Creeds +265, 'The Year of Counted Breaths.'"*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"TIMELINE NOTATION: Cycle = Pre-Glitch (Age of Forging); PG = Post-Glitch (Age of Echoes). EPOCH: Year 0 PG = H-72 activation (Ginnungagap Glitch). CURRENT: 783 PG. AGE BOUNDARIES: Silence (0-122 PG), Wandering (122-287 PG), Walls (287-518 PG), Creeds (518-783 PG). GLITCH MECHANICS: O.D.I.N. recursive logic error → YGGDRASIL cascade failure → 23-minute propagation → system-wide collapse. CONVERSION: Cycle N ≈ (N - 998) PG; uncertainty ±20 years. CALENDAR INFRASTRUCTURE: Dvergr Master Calendar (primary), Skaldic year-naming (cultural), Iron-Banes liturgical (theological), Rangers Trail Reckoning (logistics)."*

## Integration with Other Domains

| Domain | Relationship to Domain 2 |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **Domain 1 (Cosmology)** | Spatial relationships result from Glitch timeline |
| **Domain 3 (Magic System)** | Aetheric weaving emerged POST-Glitch (Year 0 creates magic) |
| **Domain 4 (Technology)** | 800 years of decay = current year minus Glitch |
| **Domain 6 (Entity Types)** | Undying/Forlorn created at Year 0 |
| **Domain 7 (Reality Rules)** | CPS/Blight mechanics originate from Glitch |
| **Domain 8 (Geography)** | The Scar created T+72 hours post-Glitch |
| **Domain 9 (Counter-Rune)** | Counter-Rune paradox tied to Glitch mechanics |

## Summary

Domain 2 answers the fundamental question: **When did this happen?**

The answer is always relative to one moment:

**Year 0 PG. The Ginnungagap Glitch. The day everything ended.**

Before that moment: the Age of Forging and Cycle notation.

After that moment: the Age of Echoes and PG notation.

The five ages of POST-Glitch history:
1. **Silence** (0-122 PG): Bunkers and survival
2. **Wandering** (122-287 PG): Caravans and roads
3. **Walls** (287-518 PG): Holds and guilds
4. **Creeds** (518-783 PG): Belief and doctrine

We are now in Year 783 PG. The Age of Creeds. "The Year of Counted Breaths."

Seven hundred and eighty-three years since the Silence fell.

Seven hundred and eighty-three years of survival in the ruins of a broken world.

And the counting continues.

> *"We count from the moment everything ended. Not to mourn what was lost, but to measure how far we have come. Every year is a victory. Every breath is counted."*
