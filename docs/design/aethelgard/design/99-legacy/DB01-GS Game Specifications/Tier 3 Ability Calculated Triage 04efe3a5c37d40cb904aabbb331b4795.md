### **Ability Overview**

**Specialization:** Jötun-Reader (System Pathologist)

**Tier:** 3 (Mastery of Lore)

**Type:** Passive (Positional Aura)

**Prerequisite:** 20 PP spent in the Jötun-Reader tree

**Cost:** 7 PP

### **Description**

The Jötun-Reader's analytical mind extends to battlefield medicine. They can spot the most efficient way to apply a poultice or stabilize a comrade—identifying optimal wound access, pressure points, and treatment sequences. Their clinical guidance makes healing more effective through pure tactical optimization.

### **Mechanics**

**Effect:** Any character using a healing consumable on an ally standing **adjacent** to the Jötun-Reader will cause that consumable to heal for **25% more**.

**Range:** Adjacent squares only (must be in melee range of the Jötun-Reader)

**Application:** The bonus applies to:

- Bone-Setter healing abilities that consume items
- Any character using healing consumables
- Does NOT apply to non-consumable healing (spells, innate regeneration, etc.)

**Framing:** The Jötun-Reader provides real-time anatomical guidance:

- "Apply pressure to the brachial artery first"
- "The wound track angles upward—follow it with the needle"
- "That bone is fractured—set it at 15 degrees, not perpendicular"

### **Thematic Justification**

The Jötun-Reader is not healing—they're **optimizing someone else's healing**. Their anatomical knowledge allows them to guide the actual healer to more effective treatment. Think of them as a surgical assistant calling out anatomical landmarks during field surgery.

### **Progression & Milestones**

### **Rank 1 (Foundational)**

- **Effect:** Healing consumables used on allies adjacent to Jötun-Reader heal for **+25% more**
- **Range:** Adjacent squares only

### **Rank 3 (Mastery)**

- **Unlocked:** Capstone ability unlocked (35-40 PP in tree)
- **Effect:** Healing bonus increased to **+50%**
- **Range:** Increased to **2 squares**
- **Additional:** Healing consumable within range removes one minor debuff ([Bleeding], [Poisoned], or [Disoriented])
- **Special:** Once per combat, can designate a **"Field Hospital" zone** (3x3 area) for 3 rounds:
    - All healing increased by **+75%**
    - Allies gain **+2 to all defensive Resolve Checks**
    - Healing consumables cost **half normal action**

### **Integration Notes**

- **Support Synergy:** Creates powerful interaction with Bone-Setter specialization
- **Positional Play:** Rewards tactical positioning and party coordination
- **Resource Efficiency:** Makes limited healing consumables stretch further
- **Non-Combat Value:** Useful during rest/recovery phases as well as combat

### **Synergies**

- **Bone-Setter Specialization:** All Bone-Setter healing abilities benefit from this bonus
- **Consumable-Heavy Builds:** Parties relying on crafted healing items gain significant resource efficiency
- **Tank Warriors:** Skjaldmær and other front-line fighters benefit from positioning near Jötun-Reader
