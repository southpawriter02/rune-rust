The **Blót-Priest** is the conduit of a sick world.

They are not safe healers. They are not coherent scholars. They are practitioners of a dark and forbidden bio-Aetheric transduction who have learned that in the Age of Echoes, **life force is the ultimate currency**—and every transaction spreads Corruption.

Their magic bypasses the chaotic, tainted Aether by using a more stable, potent, and dangerous catalyst: **their own vitality, their very blood**. They drain the Blighted life force of enemies, filter it through the crucible of their own body, and offer it up as a desperate, tainted gift of healing to their allies.

They walk a razor's edge between martyrdom and monstrosity.

Their saga is a grim ledger of debts paid in blood and soul, a constant struggle to cleanse others by embracing their own Corruption.

## Core Philosophy: The Sanguine Sacrament

### The Three Principles

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **The Body is the Antenna** | Organic tissue is the only stable conduit through corrupted Aether |
| **The Ledger Must Balance** | Every gift of life requires payment in blood, soul, and purity |
| **Corruption Flows Downhill** | Healing transfers sickness; the cost is never yours alone |

The Blót-Priest's creed is not written in scripture or saga. It is written in the **language of transaction**—wound, breath, will, and the precise accounting of what is given and what is taken.

> *"They understand that the Aether is a poisoned well, and that life force itself is a currency in a failing system. Their magic is not one of creation, but of transference. They drain the corrupted life force of their enemies, filter it through the crucible of their own body, and offer it up as a desperate, tainted gift of healing."*

This is not worship. This is not salvation. This is a **brutal bargain with a broken world**.

The Blót-Priest does not pray for miracles. They open their veins and pay the price themselves. And in doing so, they become figures of both terror and desperate necessity—the only ones willing to accept the world's sickness so that others might live.

### The Heretical Path

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Source** | Bio-Aetheric transduction using organic tissue as a biological antenna |
| **Method** | Sacrificial casting, life siphon, direct vitality transfer |
| **Cost** | EXTREME Corruption accumulation; spreads Corruption to allies through healing |
| **Philosophy** | The world's sickness can be redirected, but never destroyed—only transferred |

Unlike the Vard-Warden who maintains safe barriers or the Rúnasmiðr who inscribes stable code, the Blót-Priest walks the **heretical path**. Every ability carries a cost. Every healing spreads taint. Every siphon consumes corrupted data.

This is not a sustainable path. The question is not "if" the Blót-Priest becomes deeply corrupted, but **"how fast"** and **"who else gets corrupted with them."**

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Sacrificial martyr; the healer who pays in blood |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Sacrifice → siphon → heal → corrupt → repeat |
| **Success Metric** | Party survives; Corruption is managed (or accepted) |
| **Decision Space** | HP/AP economy, Corruption distribution, risk tolerance |

Playing a Blót-Priest is about **managing a volatile economy of life and death**.

You can unleash the most powerful emergency healing in the game—but at direct cost to your own survival and long-term purity. You can keep casting long after your Aether Pool is depleted by spending HP instead. You can siphon life from enemies to replenish your reserves. But every transaction spreads Corruption.

> *"Your saga is written in the blood you spill—both your own and your enemies'. You walk a razor's edge, balancing your own life force against the fate of your allies, a figure of both terror and desperate necessity in a world that has forgotten the old gods."*

Your power creates moral choices no other specialization faces:
- Save an ally now, but damn them with Corruption later?
- Spread the taint evenly, or concentrate it on one willing sacrifice?
- Use Heartstopper knowing it corrupts the entire party?

This is unique to the Blót-Priest. No other specialization forces players to **harm allies to help them**.

## Abilities: The Rites of Blood

### Tier 1 — Foundational Rites

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Sanguine Pact** | Passive | — | Unlocks HP casting at 2:1 ratio (2 HP per 1 AP); each HP-cast inflicts Corruption |
| **Blood Siphon** | Active | 35 AP (or 70 HP) | Moderate Arcane damage; heal 50% of damage dealt; inflicts Corruption on self |
| **Gift of Vitae** | Active | 15% Max HP | Large single-target heal; transfers small amount of Corruption to ally |

**Sanguine Pact** is the irreversible opening. The Blót-Priest learns to open their veins to the tainted Aether, their blood becoming a conduit for magic that is both potent and perilous.

| Mechanic | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| HP Casting Ratio | 2 HP per 1 AP |
| Corruption per HP-Cast | +1 Runic Blight Corruption |
| Requirement | Unlocks all HP-cost abilities |

> *"Using one's own life force as a direct conduit bypasses the 'filter' of the mind, opening a direct channel for the Blight's corruption. This is a profoundly heretical act."*

**Blood Siphon** is the corrupted harvest—a crimson tendril of energy that leeches the tainted life force of a foe, drawing it back to the caster. This is not simple theft; it is consumption of Blighted data.

> *"You extend a hand, and a crimson tendril of energy leeches the tainted life force of your foe. The vitality flows back to you—but so does a fraction of their Blight."*

**Gift of Vitae** is the tainted gift—a direct transfer of the Priest's own vital essence into an ally. The most powerful single-target heal in the early game, but it carries a subtle, insidious price.

| Effect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Healing | Large amount (scales with Max HP sacrificed) |
| Cost | 15% of Priest's Max HP |
| Corruption Transfer | Small amount to ally |

### Tier 2 — Advanced Sacraments

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Blood Ward** | Active | 10% Max HP | Places damage-absorbing \[Blood Ward\] on ally; ward HP = 2× HP sacrificed |
| **Exsanguinate** | Active | 50 AP (or 100 HP) | 3-turn curse; Arcane DoT; 25% lifesteal per tick; inflicts Corruption |
| **Crimson Vigor** | Passive | — | Lower HP = stronger healing/siphon; significant bonus when \[Bloodied\] |

**Blood Ward** is the sacrificial aegis—a glyph drawn in the air with the Priest's own life force, solidifying into a shimmering crimson shield.

| Ward Property | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Duration | 2 rounds |
| Ward HP | 2× the HP sacrificed |
| Target | Single ally |

**Exsanguinate** is the parasitic curse—a vicious, metaphysical sigil that doesn't just wound, but slowly drains the victim's life force back to the caster over time.

> *"You place a curse that does not merely harm—it harvests. Each tick of damage returns a portion of vitality to you, but consuming Blighted life force taints your own soul."*

**Crimson Vigor** is the masochistic feedback loop. The Blót-Priest learns to not just endure pain, but to thrive on it.

| Health Threshold | Effect |
|------------------|--------|
| Above 50% HP | Standard healing/siphon potency |
| \[Bloodied\] (<50% HP) | Significantly increased healing and siphon effectiveness |
| High Corruption | Additional siphon bonus |

### Tier 3 — Mastery of Life and Death

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Hemorrhaging Curse** | Active | 60 AP (or 120 HP) | Arcane DoT + \[Bleeding\] + reduces incoming healing on target |
| **Martyr's Resolve** | Passive | — | While \[Bloodied\]: significant Soak bonus + Resolve bonus vs Psychic Stress |

**Hemorrhaging Curse** is the evolved siphon—a curse that doesn't just drain life, but corrupts it, causing the victim's blood to actively rebel and their wounds to resist the logic of healing.

| Effect | Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Arcane DoT | 3d6/turn | 4d6/turn | 5d6/turn |
| \[Bleeding\] | 1d6/turn | 2d6/turn | 3d6/turn |
| Healing Reduction | 50% | 75% | 100% (cannot be healed) |
| Lifesteal | 25% total damage | 25% total damage | 25% total damage |

> *"Their blood rebels. Their wounds refuse to close. The logic of healing fails against the entropy you have inscribed into their flesh."*

**Martyr's Resolve** represents the profound acceptance of pain and imminent death that is the cornerstone of the Blót-Priest's practice. As their life force ebbs away, their corrupted soul hardens.

| Threshold | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| \[Bloodied\] (<50% HP) | +5 Soak, +2d to Resolve vs Psychic Stress |
| Rank 2 | +7 Soak, +3d Resolve |
| Rank 3 | Enhanced further |

### Capstone — Heartstopper

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Cost** | 50% of Current HP, once per combat |
| **Corruption** | Massive Runic Blight Corruption inflicted on the Priest |
| **Death Defiance** | If sacrifice would kill, HP set to 1 instead |

The capstone **Heartstopper** is the ultimate sacrament—the Priest willingly stops their own heart for a single, terrifying moment to become a pure conduit for the world's cycle of corrupted life and death.

**Choose one effect:**

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Crimson Deluge** | Massive AoE heal to all allies; transfers moderate Corruption to each of them |
| **Final Anathema** | Massive Arcane damage to single enemy bypassing all resistances; transfers large portion of Priest's Corruption to target (may cause Reality Glitch) |

> *"You perform the ultimate sacrament. Your heart stops. For a single, terrifying moment, you become a pure conduit for the world's cycle of corrupted life and death. And then you choose: save them all, or destroy one utterly."*

**Warning:** Crimson Deluge saves the party but spreads your Corruption to every ally. Final Anathema can potentially cause a catastrophic Reality Glitch in the target if enough Corruption is transferred.

## Systemic Integration

### v5.0 Setting Compliance: Bio-Aetheric Transduction

| Fantasy Term | v5.0 Technical Reality |
|--------------|------------------------|
| "Blood Magic" | Bio-Aetheric transduction using organic tissue as biological antenna |
| "Life Siphon" | Extracting bio-electric energy from dying neural tissue (contaminated with Blight patterns) |
| "Blight Transference" | Direct cellular-level Corruption exchange through biological contact (blood-to-blood) |
| "Hemorrhaging Curse" | Inducing cascading cellular breakdown via Aetheric resonance frequencies |

**The Blót-Priest is NOT a fantasy blood mage.** They are a biological system hacker who uses their own body as a corruptible medium for power transfer. It's horrifying biotech, not magic.

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Heretical (extreme negative Trauma interactions) |
| **Self-Inflicted Risk** | EXTREME (every HP-cast inflicts Corruption; siphons inflict Corruption) |
| **Ally Risk** | HIGH (healing transfers Corruption to allies) |
| **Mitigation** | Martyr's Resolve provides Resolve bonus; high WILL essential |
| **Strategic Implication** | Corruption spiral is inevitable; question is speed and distribution |

The Blót-Priest is the most Corruption-intensive specialization in the game:

| Action | Corruption Gain |
|--------|-----------------|
| Every HP-cast | +1 Corruption |
| Every Life Siphon | +1 Corruption |
| Gift of Vitae | Transfers Corruption to ally |
| Heartstopper (Crimson Deluge) | Massive gain + transfers to all allies |

This is intentional. **Blót-Priests are inevitably corrupted.**

### The Moral Dimension

Blight Transference creates unique ethical gameplay:

| Decision | Consequence |
|----------|-------------|
| Save ally with Gift of Vitae | They gain a fraction of your Corruption |
| Use Crimson Deluge | Entire party gains moderate Corruption |
| Focus healing on one ally | They accumulate more Corruption than others |
| Use Final Anathema | Enemy may suffer Reality Glitch from Corruption overload |

> *"This is unique to Blót-Priest. No other spec forces players to harm allies to help them."*

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Iron-Hearted / Tanks** | Enables "death-ball" tactics; massive burst healing keeps damaged party alive |
| **Heretical Builds** | Shared Corruption tolerance; party accepts taint as cost of power |
| **Vard-Warden** | Shield before HP-cast reduces self-damage; protects Priest during sacrificial casting |
| **Bone-Setter** | Coherent healer can manage Corruption spread; provides alternative healing |
| **Controllers** | Formation control creates windows for safe sacrificial casting |

The Blót-Priest is the **ultimate enabler for attrition parties**—groups that expect to take heavy damage and trade Corruption for survival.

> *"A skilled Blót-Priest in a target-rich environment can be a perpetual motion machine, siphoning health from enemies to fuel the healing of allies."*

### Positional Considerations

| Position | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Behind Front Line** | Protected while casting; can reach all allies with healing |
| **Adjacent to Enemies** | Blood Siphon and Exsanguinate at optimal range |
| **\[Bloodied\] State** | Crimson Vigor active; significantly enhanced potency |

The Blót-Priest is optimized for **mid-line operation**—close enough to siphon, protected enough to survive the HP costs.

## Lore Integration

### Social Function in Aethelgard

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Crisis Healer** | Pays real costs to prevent worse losses; exists because someone bled with consent |
| **Self-Sustaining Engine** | In crowded rooms of foes, disciplined siphon loops keep the celebrant standing |
| **Window Maker** | Works best behind a held wall (Skjaldmær, Atgeir) to buy the breath a rite requires |
| **Corruption Sink** | Accepts the world's sickness so others don't have to |

The Blót-Priest is not a beloved figure. They are a **necessary horror**—the one willing to pay the price no one else will pay.

> *"No theatrical suffering. Cruelty disguised as sacrament is malpractice; the ledger records motive and math."*

### Ethics and Risk Governance

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Consent Before Transaction** | Never transfer Corruption without the recipient's knowledge |
| **The Ledger Balances** | Record every cost, every transfer, every debt paid and owed |
| **No Theatrical Suffering** | Cruelty disguised as sacrament is malpractice |
| **Contain the Spread** | Kaupmaðr custody for rite implements; sealed bowls reduce rumor |

The Blót-Priest tradition has formalized strict protocols around consent, containment, and accounting. CPS (Corruption/Psychic Stress) exposure from chant-adjacent focus and repeating pain patterns can open cognitive loops; Skald cadence is used to ground witnesses.

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Iron-Banes** | Heresy; the practice spreads the very Corruption they seek to purge |
| **Jötun-Readers** | Clinical fascination; the bio-Aetheric transduction merits study |
| **Bone-Setters** | Professional tension; coherent medicine vs. sacrificial rites |
| **God-Sleepers** | Theological complexity; sacrifice has divine precedent, but Corruption spreads |
| **Rust-Clans** | Pragmatic respect; they understand blood-pacts and the Tinkerer's Prayer |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the old tales, the priests who healed did so with prayer and blessing. In the Age of Echoes, prayer is static and blessing is noise. The Blót-Priest learned a different way. They open their veins and let the world's sickness flow through them. They drain the life from the dying and give it to the living. They are the conduits of a sick world, and their magic is written in blood. Every gift of life is paid in soul. Every healing spreads the taint. They walk between martyrdom and monstrosity, figures of terror and desperate necessity. When the shield-wall breaks and the wounded scream, it is the Blót-Priest who steps forward, opens their veins, and pays the price no one else will pay. Their saga is a grim ledger of debts. Blood given. Soul taken. The world's sickness accepted so that others might live one more day."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Blót-Priest (Sacrificial Conduit) represents the Heretical Mystic specialization optimized for high-risk healing and life-force manipulation. Mechanical role: emergency healer with HP-as-resource casting and Corruption transference. Key differentiator: can cast after AP depleted by spending HP at 2:1 ratio; healing transfers Corruption to allies. Core mechanics: Sanguine Pact (HP casting unlock), Life Siphon (enemy HP drain with self-Corruption), Blight Transference (healing spreads taint). Signature ability: Heartstopper (once-per-combat ultimate sacrifice; choose massive AoE heal with party-wide Corruption transfer OR massive single-target damage with Corruption dump). Social function: crisis healer and Corruption sink—pays real costs to prevent worse losses. Trauma Economy interaction: EXTREME risk; every HP-cast and siphon inflicts Corruption; inevitable spiral. Optimal deployment: attrition parties, extended operations where Corruption is accepted cost, emergency rescue scenarios."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Blót-Priest (Sacrificial Conduit). ARCHETYPE: Mystic. PATH TYPE: Heretical. ROLE: Sacrificial Caster / High-Risk Healer. PRIMARY STAT: WILL. SECONDARY STAT: STURDINESS. RESOURCE: Aether Pool (AP) OR Health Pool (HP). CORE MECHANICS: Sanguine Pact (HP casting at 2:1 ratio, +1 Corruption per cast), Life Siphon (50% lifesteal, +1 Corruption), Blight Transference (healing transfers Corruption to target). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Rites): Sanguine Pact, Blood Siphon, Gift of Vitae. T2 (Advanced Sacraments): Blood Ward, Exsanguinate, Crimson Vigor. T3 (Mastery): Hemorrhaging Curse, Martyr's Resolve. CAPSTONE: Heartstopper (50% Current HP, once per combat; Option 1: Crimson Deluge [massive AoE heal + Corruption transfer to all allies]; Option 2: Final Anathema [massive Arcane damage bypassing resistances + Corruption transfer to enemy]). DEATH DEFIANCE: If HP sacrifice would kill, set HP to 1 instead. CORRUPTION RATE: Every HP-cast +1, every siphon +1, Gift of Vitae transfers small amount, Heartstopper transfers moderate/large amount. SYNERGIES: Tanks (death-ball enable), Vard-Warden (shield before sacrifice), Heretical builds (shared Corruption tolerance)."*

## Summary

The Blót-Priest is the **conduit of a sick world**.

They do not pray for healing. They do not channel pure light. They open their veins and pay the price in blood and soul. They drain the corrupted life force of enemies, filter it through their own body, and offer it up as a desperate, tainted gift to their allies.

Their power is unmatched. The most powerful emergency healing in the game. The ability to cast long after Aether is depleted. Self-sustaining siphon loops that keep them standing in target-rich environments. But every transaction spreads Corruption.

This creates a unique role: the **heretical healer** who exists because someone must be willing to pay the price no one else will pay. When the shield-wall breaks and the wounded scream, it is the Blót-Priest who steps forward.

But this is not salvation. This is transaction.

The Blót-Priest understands that in the Age of Echoes, there is no free healing. Every gift of life requires payment. Every act of mercy spreads taint. They accept this. They open their veins anyway. And they keep the grim ledger of what is given and what is taken.

*Every act of healing is a willing acceptance of the world's sickness.
Every gift of life is paid in blood and soul.
The ledger must balance.*
