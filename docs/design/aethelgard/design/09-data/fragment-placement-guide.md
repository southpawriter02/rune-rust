# Data Capture Placement Guide

This document provides guidelines for placing Data Captures in the game world to create a satisfying discovery experience.

---

## 1. Placement Principles

### 1.1 Core Philosophy

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Rewarded Exploration** | Thorough players find more fragments |
| **Multiple Paths** | Different playstyles can complete entries |
| **Escalating Difficulty** | Later fragments require more effort |
| **Contextual Discovery** | Fragments found where they make sense |
| **Optional Depth** | Mastery is rewarding but not required |

### 1.2 The 1-3-5 Rule

For entries with multiple fragments:

| Fragment Position | Difficulty | Typical Method |
|-------------------|------------|----------------|
| **First 1/3** | Easy | Exploration, common loot |
| **Middle 1/3** | Medium | Examination, dialogue, quests |
| **Final 1/3** | Hard | Specialist, hidden areas, boss rewards |

---

## 2. Placement by Capture Type

### 2.1 Text Fragments

**Best Locations:**
- Readable objects (data-slates, journals, inscriptions)
- Corpse loot (personal effects, notes)
- Archive/library rooms
- Settlement shops (purchasable)

**Placement Examples:**

| Location Type | Example |
|---------------|---------|
| **Ruin exploration** | Data-slate on desk in collapsed office |
| **Container loot** | Journal in locked chest |
| **Environmental** | Inscription on monument base |
| **Purchasable** | Manuscript from scholar vendor |

---

### 2.2 Echo Recordings

**Best Locations:**
- Jötun-Forged sites (cockpits, control rooms)
- Silver Cord infrastructure
- Communication terminals
- Memory echo hotspots

**Placement Examples:**

| Location Type | Example |
|---------------|---------|
| **Jötun-Forged** | Recording in dormant frame cockpit |
| **Control center** | Terminal in ODIN facility |
| **Battlefield** | Echo at significant death location |
| **Archive** | Preserved recording in data vault |

**Special Consideration:** Echo Recordings often require entering dangerous areas. The audio corruption level should hint at the area's danger.

---

### 2.3 Visual Records

**Best Locations:**
- Engineering facilities
- Archives and libraries
- Hidden chambers (puzzle rewards)
- Quest rewards

**Placement Examples:**

| Location Type | Example |
|---------------|---------|
| **Workshop** | Schematic on drafting table |
| **Hidden room** | Blueprint in secret vault |
| **Quest reward** | Map fragment from grateful NPC |
| **Examination** | Detailed diagram requires WITS check |

---

### 2.4 Specimens

**Best Locations:**
- Enemy corpses (post-combat)
- Environmental features (unusual materials)
- Specialist examination results
- Lab/workshop analysis

**Placement Examples:**

| Location Type | Example |
|---------------|---------|
| **Combat drop** | Examine defeated Rust-Horror |
| **Environmental** | Analyze strange crystal formation |
| **Quest objective** | Collect sample for researcher |
| **Specialist** | Jötun-Reader analyzes mechanism |

**Special Consideration:** Specimens should feel like "scientific discovery" — the player is learning through direct observation.

---

### 2.5 Oral History

**Best Locations:**
- NPC dialogue (reputation-gated)
- Quest completion rewards
- Keyword-unlocked conversations
- Random encounter NPCs

**Placement Examples:**

| Location Type | Example |
|---------------|---------|
| **Reputation gate** | Elder shares lore at Friendly status |
| **Keyword unlock** | Scholar responds to "All-Rune" topic |
| **Quest reward** | Survivor tells story after rescue |
| **Random** | Traveling merchant shares rumor |

**Special Consideration:** Oral History should feel like a conversation — personal, sometimes unreliable, emotionally resonant.

---

### 2.6 Runic Traces

**Best Locations:**
- Specialist-only examination results
- Seiðkona/Vard-Warden abilities
- Ancient rune sites
- High-danger Blight zones

**Placement Examples:**

| Location Type | Example |
|---------------|---------|
| **Specialist ability** | Vard-Warden reads Blight residue |
| **Rune examination** | Analyze inscription with Runic Lore |
| **Dangerous zone** | Pattern visible only in Blight hotspot |
| **Ritual site** | Decoded at ancient ceremonial location |

**Special Consideration:** Runic Traces are rare and valuable — they should feel like privileged knowledge.

---

## 3. Difficulty Scaling

### 3.1 Fragment Difficulty by Position

| Entry Progress | Difficulty | Methods |
|----------------|------------|---------|
| **Fragment 1** | Trivial | Automatic discovery, common loot |
| **Fragment 2** | Easy | Basic exploration, simple examination |
| **Fragment 3** | Medium | Dialogue (reputation), detailed examination |
| **Fragment 4** | Hard | Hidden areas, expert examination, quests |
| **Fragment 5+** | Very Hard | Specialist, boss rewards, major quests |

### 3.2 Examination Difficulty

| Level | WITS DC | Stress Cost | Typical Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Cursory** | — | 0 | Creates stub entry only |
| **Basic** | 10 | 5 | First 50% of combat data |
| **Detailed** | 14 | 10 | Vulnerabilities, most abilities |
| **Expert** | 18 | 15 | Hidden abilities, full data |
| **Specialist** | Varies | Varies | Tactical notes, unique content |

### 3.3 Dialogue Requirements

| Requirement | Typical Use | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **None** | Early fragments | Merchant mentions rumor |
| **Neutral reputation** | Mid fragments | Elder shares history |
| **Friendly reputation** | Later fragments | Scholar reveals secrets |
| **Keyword unlock** | Advanced content | "All-Rune" topic response |
| **Quest completion** | Major reveals | Rescued NPC tells full story |

---

## 4. Location Theming

### 4.1 Match Content to Location

| Entry Category | Ideal Locations |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **BlightOrigin** | Jötun-Forged sites, Blight zones, archives |
| **TechnicalKnowledge** | Dvergr workshops, engineering bays |
| **FactionHistory** | Faction settlements, historical sites |
| **Mechanical creatures** | Industrial ruins, workshops |
| **Undying creatures** | Jötun-Forged cockpits, battlefields |
| **Beast creatures** | Wilderness, hunting grounds |

### 4.2 Environmental Storytelling

Fragments should feel naturally placed:

| Good Placement | Poor Placement |
|----------------|----------------|
| Dvergr journal in Dvergr ruin | Dvergr journal in random cave |
| Servitor schematic in workshop | Servitor schematic in bedroom |
| Ash-Vargr specimen from corpse | Ash-Vargr specimen in library |

---

## 5. Cross-Entry Linking

### 5.1 Fragment Networks

Design fragments to reference related entries:

```
The Ginnungagap Glitch
├── Fragment 1 → mentions "Einherjar" (links to The Forlorn)
├── Fragment 2 → mentions "Silver Cord" (links to Jötun-Forged entry)
├── Fragment 3 → mentions "All-Rune" (keyword unlock)
└── Fragment 4 → mentions "Dvergr artificers" (links to Dvergr Engineering)
```

### 5.2 Location Clusters

Group related fragments in the same area:

| Area | Fragment Cluster |
|------|------------------|
| **Jötun-Forged Site** | Ginnungagap, Forlorn, Einherjar, Silver Cord |
| **Dvergr Workshop** | Iron Heart, Servitor, Dvergr Engineering |
| **Rust-Clan Settlement** | Rust-Clan History, Salvage Economy, Bodging |
| **God-Sleeper Shrine** | God-Sleeper Faith, Holy Martyrs, Divine Machines |

---

## 6. Reward Pacing

### 6.1 Discovery Frequency

Target discovery rate per hour of play:

| Content Type | Target Rate |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Text Fragments** | 3-5 per hour |
| **Echo Recordings** | 1-2 per hour |
| **Visual Records** | 1-2 per hour |
| **Specimens** | 2-4 per hour (combat dependent) |
| **Oral History** | 1-3 per hour (dialogue dependent) |
| **Runic Traces** | 0-1 per hour (specialist only) |

### 6.2 Entry Completion Pacing

| Entry Size | Expected Time to Complete |
|------------|---------------------------|
| 3 fragments | 1-2 play sessions |
| 4 fragments | 2-3 play sessions |
| 5 fragments | 3-4 play sessions |
| 6+ fragments | Multiple sessions, zone completion |

### 6.3 Keyword Unlock Timing

Keywords should unlock at moments of narrative significance:

| Unlock Point | Narrative Purpose |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **25%** | Early hint, encourages further exploration |
| **50%** | Core concept understood, enables dialogue |
| **75%** | Deep understanding, reveals connections |
| **100%** | Full mastery, unlocks advanced content |

## 7. Special Placement Patterns

### 7.1 The "Breadcrumb" Pattern

Lead players through an area with sequential fragments:

```
Room 1: Fragment 1 (entry visible as stub)
       ↓
Room 2: Fragment 2 (hints at Room 3)
       ↓
Room 3: Fragment 3 (hints at boss room)
       ↓
Boss Room: Fragment 4 (entry complete)
```

### 7.2 The "Hub" Pattern

Central location with radiating fragments:

```
         Fragment 1 (North)
              ↑
Fragment 2 ← HUB → Fragment 3
              ↓
         Fragment 4 (South)
```

### 7.3 The "Gatekeeper" Pattern

Progression-locked fragments:

```
Fragment 1: Free (exploration)
Fragment 2: Requires Faction Rep
Fragment 3: Requires Keyword from Fragment 2
Fragment 4: Requires Quest Completion
Fragment 5: Requires Specialist (final insight)
```

## 8. Common Mistakes

### 8.1 Avoid These Patterns

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **All in one room** | No exploration reward | Spread across area |
| **Random placement** | No thematic coherence | Match content to location |
| **All high-difficulty** | Frustrating progression | Escalate difficulty |
| **No cross-references** | Isolated entries | Link related content |
| **Mandatory specialists** | Locks out playstyles | Specialists add depth, not gates |

### 8.2 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Can entry be started without specialist abilities?
- [ ] Are fragments distributed across multiple locations?
- [ ] Does difficulty escalate appropriately?
- [ ] Do fragments make sense in their locations?
- [ ] Are keywords unlocked at useful moments?
- [ ] Do fragments reference related entries?

## 9. Placement Templates

### 9.1 Standard Codex Entry (4 fragments)

| Fragment | Type | Placement | Difficulty |
|----------|------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | Text Fragment | Readable object in relevant area | Easy |
| 2 | Echo Recording | Requires entering dangerous sub-area | Medium |
| 3 | Oral History | NPC dialogue (reputation or keyword) | Medium |
| 4 | Runic Trace or Visual | Specialist OR hidden area reward | Hard |

### 9.2 Standard Bestiary Entry (3 lore fragments)

| 2 | Text or Oral | Workshop note OR hunter dialogue | Medium |
| 3 | Specialist | Specialist analysis (tactical notes) | Hard |

### 9.3 Field Guide Entry (auto-discovery)

Field Guide entries typically auto-unlock on first encounter with the mechanic — no manual placement required.
