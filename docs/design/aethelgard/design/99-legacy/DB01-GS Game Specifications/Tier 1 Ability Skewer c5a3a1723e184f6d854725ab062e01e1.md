## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Skewer is the Atgeir-wielder's **bread-and-butter attack**—the disciplined thrust that defines their entire playstyle. Its core identity is the **[Reach]** property, which enables the "back-row fighter" fantasy by allowing attacks on the enemy Front Row while positioned safely in the Player Back Row.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Deal FINESSE-based single-target Physical (Piercing) damage
- **Secondary:** Enable safe damage contribution via [Reach] property
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The precise, practiced polearm thrust from safety

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Moderate (standard single-target damage)
- **[Reach] Advantage:** Safety trades for damage output
- **Polearm Requirement:** Must have [Polearm] weapon equipped
- **Positioning Reward:** Maximum value when used from Back Row

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Skewer is not a wild lunge or desperate thrust—it is **geometry made lethal**. The Atgeir-wielder has calculated the angles, measured the distance, and executed the motion ten thousand times. The atgeir's length becomes an advantage as the tip finds its mark with mechanical precision.

From the safety of the back row, the warrior's blade reaches past their allies, past the chaos of the frontline, to pierce the enemy's defenses with surgical accuracy.

### Thematic Resonance

Skewer is the Atgeir-wielder's core expression—proof that superior positioning and technique defeat brute force.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Activation

- **Action Type:** Standard Action
- **Cost:** 40 Stamina
- **Range:** Melee with [Reach] (see below)
- **Target:** Single enemy in Enemy Front Row
- **Prerequisite:** [Polearm] weapon equipped

### The [Reach] Property

**Core Rule:** Can attack Enemy Front Row while positioned in Player Back Row

- Bypasses normal melee engagement rules
- Does NOT allow attacking Enemy Back Row from Player Back Row
- Standard melee attack if both combatants in Front Rows

### Effect

**Damage:** Weapon damage + FINESSE (Physical - Piercing)

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Validation:** Confirm target in Enemy Front Row, Polearm equipped
2. **Position Check:** If attacker in Back Row, [Reach] allows attack
3. **Cost Payment:** Spend 40 Stamina
4. **Attack Roll:** FINESSE + Weapon Skill vs target Defense
5. **Damage Application:** On hit, deal Weapon + FINESSE Piercing

---

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Skjaldmær (Front Tank):** Perfect formation—tank absorbs hits, Atgeir deals damage
- **Formal Training I:** Stamina regen sustains Skewer usage
- **Hook and Drag:** Pull target to Front Row, then Skewer safely
- **Vargr-Born:** [Bleeding] from Rank 2 feeds their Taste for Blood

### Negative Synergies

- **No Polearm:** Cannot use without proper weapon
- **Back Row enemies:** Cannot reach Enemy Back Row from Player Back Row
- **Crowded Front Row:** Less value if forced into Front Row
