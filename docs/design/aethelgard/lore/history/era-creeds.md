## Exposure Timeline (Age of Creeds)

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **T+7c: Post‑Wall Stabilization** | Food surplus and urban consolidation create cognitive surplus → Great Question emerges. |
| **Propagation Vectors** | Trade routes of the Midgard Combine carry missionaries and doctrine alongside grain and steel. |
| **Factional Consolidation** | Scriptoriums (Jötun‑Readers), Pure Forges (Iron‑Bane), Shrines/Pilgrimages (God‑Sleepers). |
| **Frontier Divergence** | Niflheim and northern decks see Scavenger Baron ascendancy and Dreadnought polities. |

## Diagnostic Flags

| Flag | Assessment |
|------|------------|
| **Ideological Epidemiology** | Rapid memetic uptake where Undying pressure or Jötun‑Forged proximity are high. |
| **Urban Risk Zones** | Mixed‑Creed holds like Crossroads prone to proxy conflicts and resource capture contests. |
| **Operational Hazards** | Dreadnought corridors disrupt Combine logistics and Scriptorium courier networks. |
| **Language Weapons** | Proliferation of Anvil‑Cant and counter‑cant practices increases polarization and violence efficiency. |

## Preface

> This document comprises the fourth chapter of the definitive meta-narrative of the post-Glitch world. It details the societal and philosophical schism that occurred following the relative stability of the Age of Walls. This period, known as the **Age of Creeds**, is defined by the rise of three dominant, irreconcilable ideologies born from the ashes of the old world. Their escalating conflict, a "cold war of ideas," continues to shape the social, political, and military landscape of the present day.

## 0.9 Synopsis — Age of Creeds (L2)

Belief becomes infrastructure in the Age of Creeds. When walls steady surplus and roads regularize risk, the Combine's arteries begin to carry doctrine as predictably as grain. Readers turn field craft into law via Scriptoriums, codifying custody, concordance debates, and courier charters. God‑Sleepers sanctify humming sites and pilgrim roads, translating maintenance hum into liturgy and building maps of mercy between shrines. Iron‑Banes weaponize certainty, converting purity into policy through edicts, marches, and charters that carve corridors of enforced absence.

For a generation, the Crossroads truces hold—markets and messengers passing through a civic neutral—until guarantees fail and border fires resume.

**The age's signature** is administrative faith: texts, rites, and roads bind the Combine as tightly as stone.

**Its method** is memetics: cant and counter‑cant evolve into tools, and inversion debates move from lecture to law.

**Its risk** is polarization: belief hardens borders faster than stone, and logistics become arguments.

**The legacy** is a continent where arguments have addresses—Scriptoriums, Pure Forges, Shrines—each with its own calendar and courier. The struggle for meaning is no longer private grief; it is public works.

## 1.0 The Genesis of the Schism

The Age of Creeds was born from the success of the Age of Walls. The relative safety, stability, and food surpluses achieved within the fortified Holds provided the necessary "breathing room" for a profound societal shift. With the immediate, daily question of survival—*"Will I eat today?"*—answered for many, a new, more complex, and more dangerous question rose to dominate the collective consciousness: *"Why did the world fall, and what is our place in this new order?"*

This is the **Great Question** of the modern era.

### 1.1 The Spiritual & Intellectual Vacuum

The sagas of the Skalds, which had been the cultural bedrock for centuries, proved insufficient to answer this new, existential question.

- **The Limit of the Saga:** The Skalds' oral traditions perfectly preserved the memory of Ragnarok—the tales of falling fire, the death of the gods, the coming of the Fimbulwinter. But they offered no *meaning*. The stories were a record of a trauma, not an explanation for it.
- **The Unanswered Question:** This created a profound spiritual and intellectual vacuum. People, now safe behind their walls, looked out at the silent, moss-covered Jotun-Forged frames on the horizon and needed to know: *"Was that a god? A demon? A tool? And what does its existence mean for me, my children, and our future?"* The sagas had no answer.

### 1.2 The Foundations of Dogma: From Fear and Awe to Faith

The proto-philosophies born in the isolated Holds during the Age of Walls now codified into formal, expansive, and evangelizing faiths, each offering a complete, compelling, and absolute answer to the Great Question.

- **The Iron-Banes' Answer (Fear):** The localized fear of corrupted Undying solidified into a universal dogma. The machines were not just dangerous; they were the physical manifestation of the "Iron-Curse," the original sin of the ancestors. The answer to "Why?" was simple and terrifying: *we were punished for our hubris, and the punishment is not yet over.* Their mission was born from this conclusion: to finish the purification that Ragnarok had started.
- **The God-Sleepers' Answer (Awe):** The localized reverence for the silent, majestic Jotun-Forged blossomed into an organized faith. The machines were not dead; they were divine, slumbering gods. The answer to "Why?" was simple and hopeful: *the gods are resting, and if we are faithful, they will awaken and remake the world.* Their mission was to keep a holy vigil.
- **The Jötun-Readers' Answer (Data):** While the new faiths grew, the scattered scholars and archivists continued their methodical work. Their answer to "Why?" was not a belief but a hypothesis, based on fragmented evidence: *the ancestors were not gods but brilliant programmers who made a single, catastrophic compiler error.* Their mission was to find the bug and, if possible, write the patch.

### 1.3 The Method of Spread: A Wildfire of Belief

These three core philosophies spread from their origin points along the newly secured trade routes of the Midgard Combine "like wildfire."

- **A Market for Meaning:** The merchants' caravans that carried grain and steel now also carried missionaries and zealots. They found a populace hungry for more than just food. They were hungry for purpose, for community, and for a clear path forward in a world that the old sagas could no longer explain.
- **The Birth of a Cold War:** The Creeds offered certainty in an uncertain world, and the people flocked to them. The informal, localized beliefs of the Age of Walls had become continent-spanning, competing, and mutually exclusive ideologies. The battle for physical survival was ending, and the battle for the soul of humanity had begun.

## 2.0 The Three Core Ideologies

The Age of Creeds is defined by the competing, irreconcilable worldviews of the three major factions. Each offers a distinct, absolute, and all-encompassing answer to the trauma of the Ginnungagap Glitch.

### A. The Jötun-Reader Creed ("The Debuggers" / The Archivists)

The intellectual heirs of the Aesir Technocracy, tempered by the brutal lesson of their ancestors' ultimate failure.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Dogma** | "The world is not cursed; it is broken." They believe the ancestors were not gods but brilliant programmers who made a single, catastrophic compiler error. Knowledge is salvation, and their sacred purpose (The Great Work) is to "debug" reality by recovering the lost "source code" of the past. |
| **Structure** | A hierarchical, monastic order dedicated to the preservation of knowledge. Their settlements are fortified libraries known as Scriptoriums. Their society is a meritocracy of intellect, ruled by Archivists and defended by warrior-scholars known as Lex-Guardians. |

**View of Rivals:**
- **Iron-Banes:** Viewed as ignorant, superstitious Luddites. Their crusade to destroy ruins and "tainted" technology is the ultimate sacrilege.
- **God-Sleepers:** Viewed with a kind of clinical pity. Their faith is seen as a dangerous, if understandable, pathology, a "collective fever-dream."

---

### B. The Iron-Bane Crusade ("The Purifiers")

The ultimate, violent rejection of the Aesir's technological legacy. A militant, ascetic, and fanatical faith.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Dogma** | "The world is not broken; it is sick." They believe the world is gravely ill with the "Iron-Curse"—a spiritual plague born from the blasphemous fusion of metal and spirit. Their holy duty is to act as the world's surgeons and purify it through the total destruction of all pre-Glitch technology. |
| **Structure** | A militant, hierarchical faith, organized into crusading chapters. Their settlements are grim, heavily fortified Pure Forges. Their culture is defined by discipline and the ritualized, weaponized language of Anvil-Cant. |

**View of Rivals:**
- **Jötun-Readers:** Seen as their sworn, mortal enemies. Scriptoriums are "Heretic-Towers" where the "original sin" of tainted knowledge is hoarded.
- **God-Sleepers:** Viewed as "blasphemous idolaters" and "Cog-Worshippers" who have committed the ultimate heresy: praying to the very demons the Banes must purge.

---

### C. The God-Sleeper Creed ("The Devotionals")

The final, ironic inheritors of the Aesir's power, having taken the cold, logical machines of the past and transformed them into the warm, illogical gods of a new, populist faith.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Dogma** | "The world is not broken; it is sleeping." They believe the colossal Jotun-Forged and tireless Undying are their slumbering idols. They prophesy the Great Awakening, when the gods will rise and remake the world in their own perfect, logical image. Faith is the greatest virtue, and analytical reason is a sin. |
| **Structure** | The most populist and widespread of the Creeds. Their society is organized around charismatic Prophets who lead great Pilgrimages to sacred sites (Shrines). |

**View of Rivals:**
- **Iron-Banes:** Viewed as murderous, blasphemous iconoclasts who seek to murder the sleeping gods.
- **Jötun-Readers:** Pitied as "soulless fools" and heretics who commit the ultimate sacrilege: attempting to dissect a divine miracle rather than worship it.

## 3.0 Societal and Political Impact

The rise of the Creeds transformed the scattered, isolated Holds of Aethelgard into a tense, complex, and continent-spanning battleground for the very soul of humanity.

### 3.1 Consolidation of Power: From Philosophy to Faction

- **The Jötun-Readers** founded the Scriptoriums, transforming their libraries into centers of learning and governance, protected by the Lex-Guardians.
- **The Iron-Banes** launched the first Crusades, their purifying zeal giving them a terrifying military focus. Their Pure Forges became grim, martial city-states.
- **The God-Sleepers** established great Shrines at the sites of the most colossal dormant Jotun-Forged, their mass Pilgrimages creating vast, mobile populations.

### 3.2 The Ideological Battleground: The Soul of Midgard

Every major Hold in the Midgard Combine is now a microcosm of this conflict, a cold war fought in the taverns, marketplaces, and council halls.

- **A Tense Coexistence:** Scriptorium-Annexes, Iron-Bane Chapter-Houses, and God-Sleeper Shrines all exist in a state of tense, fragile peace within cities like Crossroads, vying for the hearts, minds, and resources of the unaligned populace.
- **The Prize of the Combine:** The Midgard Combine is the primary ideological battleground precisely because its large, stable, and largely pragmatic population is "un-claimed." To the Creeds, the soul of the Combine is the soul of the future.

### 3.3 The New Lawlessness: The Rise of the Barons

While the settled Holds grew more civilized, the wild, resource-rich frontiers grew more dangerous.

- **The Power Vacuum:** In the high-risk northern Decks like Niflheim, the Creeds had little influence. The brutal realities of survival in the Fimbulwinter created a power vacuum filled not by faith but by force.
- **The Dreadnought Kings:** Powerful Scavenger Barons rose to power. They salvaged and repaired the colossal, pre-Glitch Jötun-Hauler transport vehicles, transforming them into mobile fortresses known as Dreadnoughts.
- **Mobile Feudalism:** From these roving castles, the Barons used their repaired Aesir technology and control over geothermal warmth to enforce their will, creating personal, kleptocratic fiefdoms outside the influence of any Hold or Creed.

### 3.4 The Un-Creed: The Philosophy of the Grey

A fourth, shadow-philosophy also emerged in this age, a direct and cynical response to the absolute dogmas of the great Creeds.

- **The Creed of the Self:** Primarily centered among the Rust-Clans of Utgard, the Creed of the Self (or Philosophy of the Grey) is a pragmatic rejection of all three grand narratives.
- **The Trinity of the Immediate:** Its adherents focus only on what is tangible: the Self, the Crew, and the Contract. They see the Jotun-Forged not as gods or demons but as "derelict machines, sources of salvage and danger."
- **A Sanctuary for Apostates:** This cynical, brutally honest philosophy has made Utgard a recognized sanctuary for apostates, heretics, and the disillusioned who have fled the rigid dogmas of the main Creeds.
