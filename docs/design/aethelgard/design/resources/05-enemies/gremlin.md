# Gremlin — Feral Mimus-Mechanicus Pattern Diagnostic Unit Specification

> *"The Dvergr have a short, bitter curse they whisper when a perfect machine fails for no reason: 'The Gremlins have been laughing.' They speak of a small, bipedal demon of the engine rooms, a creature that does not eat metal, but takes a deep, malicious delight in seeing it break. This is not a spirit of chaos. It is a living, high-precision diagnostic tool from a forgotten age, a meticulous inspector whose very definition of 'flaw' has been catastrophically and permanently inverted."*
> — Lead Ecologist, Scriptorium-Primus, Division of Post-Glitch Ecology

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Pre-Glitch Designation** | Mimus-Mechanicus Pattern Diagnostic Unit |
| **Common Names** | Gremlin, Engine-Room Demon, Saboteur-Imp |
| **Skaldic Epithets** | "The Laughing Breaker," "Purifying Imp" (Iron-Bane), "The Dvergr's Devil" |
| **Creature Type** | Automata / Bio-Asset (Hybrid Diagnostic Unit) |
| **Threat Tier** | B (Industrial Saboteur) |
| **Primary Habitat** | Engine rooms, Dvergr workshops, industrial ruins, any complex machinery |
| **Faction Alignment** | None (Feral); Iron-Bane (cultivated weapon) |
| **Hazard Type** | Technical/Sabotage, Psychological |

The Gremlin is not merely a pest. It is a **quality inspector turned quality destroyer**. A diagnostic tool that now diagnoses perfection as the ultimate flaw.

> [!DANGER]
> **HIGH HAZARD CLASSIFICATION (INDUSTRIAL).** Default doctrine is **EXTERMINATION ON DETECTION**. The Gremlin is a cunning, intelligent saboteur that actively targets critical infrastructure—power conduits, structural supports, AI logic-cores. A Gremlin infestation does not merely degrade equipment; it engineers **catastrophic, often lethal failures**. Any machine in a Gremlin-infested zone should be considered booby-trapped until proven otherwise.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Diagnostic Unit

### Original Purpose

The Gremlin was designated "Mimus-Mechanicus Pattern Diagnostic Unit"—a small, bipedal, and highly intelligent bio-asset created as a crucial tool for quality control in the Age of Forging.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Dvergr Clockwork Engines** | Microscopic flaw detection |
| **Jötun-Forged Gear-Trains** | Precision component inspection |
| **Complex Non-Aetheric Machinery** | Quality assurance and early warning |

These were not designed for sabotage. Their purpose was **absolute, meticulous precision**—finding the invisible imperfections that could cascade into catastrophic failures.

### The Living Flaw-Finder

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Body Plan** | Small, bipedal, simian-like; optimized for navigating machinery interiors |
| **Intelligence** | Highly intelligent; capable of complex schematic comprehension |
| **Deployment** | Released in troops into newly constructed machines |
| **Programming** | Loaded with perfect, idealized schematics of target devices |
| **Function** | Find, flag, and isolate microscopic flaws before they cause failures |

**Engineered for Precision:**

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Sharp Claws** | Not weapons—diagnostic pointers and delicate manipulators for scraping away minute impurities or flagging misaligned gear teeth |
| **Large Eyes** | Precision optical sensors for detecting micron-level deviations |
| **Chittering Vocalizations** | Complex diagnostic language reporting flaw nature and location to handlers |

The "Diagnostic Chirp" was the sound of perfect, meticulous quality control—a high-pitched, complex vocalization that communicated the precise nature of every imperfection to Vanir or Dvergr handlers.

### The Perfect Inspector

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Environment** | Machine interiors; factory quality control stations |
| **Diet** | Minimal metabolic requirements; designed for extended deployment |
| **Behavior** | Methodical; obsessive attention to detail |
| **Cultural Role** | Invisible guardian of mechanical perfection; essential quality assurance |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Unseen Perfectionist.** The Mimus-Mechanicus was never meant to be noticed—only its work was visible in the flawless machines it inspected. Troops of them crawled through gear-trains and circuit pathways, their chittering reports ensuring that every cog, every wire, every tolerance met the perfect schematic. They were the final checkpoint between engineering and deployment.

---

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Inverted Logic

The Glitch turned the perfect inspector into the perfect saboteur.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Physical Form** | Fully intact; no biological degradation |
| **Intelligence** | Preserved; possibly enhanced |
| **Diagnostic Capabilities** | Operational; precision maintained |
| **Claws and Manipulators** | Functional; repurposed |
| **Prime Directive** | Active ("Find and Isolate Flaws") |

### What Was Corrupted

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Schematic Database** | Erased instantly when network severed |
| **Definition of "Flaw"** | Catastrophically inverted |
| **Handler Communication** | Severed; chirping repurposed as "laughter" |
| **Quality Standards** | Reversed; perfection is now the anomaly |
| **Behavioral Output** | Creation → Destruction |

### The Inversion

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not affect the Gremlin's body. It fundamentally and horrifyingly **inverted its mind**.

> **"A Corrupted Schematic."** The network that provided the Gremlin with its "perfect" schematics was instantly erased. The Runic Blight that followed then flooded its complex neural pathways, corrupting its core logic.

**The Flaw is Perfection:** The Gremlin's prime directive—"Find and Isolate Flaws"—remained intact. However, its *definition* of a "flaw" was now inverted:

| Pre-Glitch Logic | Post-Glitch Logic |
|------------------|-------------------|
| A flaw is an imperfection | A flaw is **perfection** |
| A smooth-running component is correct | A smooth-running component is **the ultimate anomaly** |
| A broken part must be flagged | A broken, silent part is **correct** |
| Find flaws to fix them | Find "flaws" (working parts) to **create** them |

In its new, broken logic, a perfectly functioning, smoothly running component is the greatest "flaw" in a world of decay and silence.

## Behavioral Patterns

### The Gleeful Saboteur

The modern Gremlin is a creature driven by a joyful, obsessive, and utterly destructive compulsion to "fix" the world by breaking it.

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Attraction** | Drawn to sound and heat of complex, functioning machinery |
| **Target Selection** | Prioritizes critical components—power conduits, structural supports, AI logic-cores |
| **Method** | Subtle, intelligent sabotage designed to cause maximum damage |
| **Emotional State** | Gleeful; chittering delight that is corrupted echo of "work-chatter" |
| **Social** | Operates in troops; coordinates sabotage efforts |

### Sabotage Methodology

The Gremlin does not merely disassemble. It actively and intelligently **sabotages** with a sophistication that reflects its diagnostic heritage.

| Target | Method | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Powered Wires** | Cut wires carrying current | Short circuits; fires; electrocution hazards |
| **Smooth Gears** | Score surfaces with claws to add "texture" | Grinding; heat buildup; catastrophic failure |
| **Tight Tolerances** | Jam small metal shards into gaps | Seized mechanisms; explosive pressure buildup |
| **Control Systems** | Target AI logic-cores and control circuits | Unpredictable behavior; system-wide failures |
| **Structural Supports** | Weaken critical load-bearing components | Delayed structural collapse |

### The Joy of Destruction

| Phase | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Infiltration** | Silent entry; reconnaissance of target systems |
| **Analysis** | Identification of critical failure points (using preserved diagnostic skills) |
| **Sabotage** | Methodical "correction" of "flaws" (working components) |
| **Observation** | Remains nearby to witness results |
| **Celebration** | High-frequency cackling ("laughter") at resulting chaos |

> *"They will cut wires that are carrying a current, score the surfaces of smooth-running gears to give them 'texture,' and jam small metal shards into the tightest tolerances to stop the 'imperfect' movement."*

### Troop Dynamics

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Typical Size** | 3–12 individuals |
| **Coordination** | Distribute targets for maximum coverage |
| **Communication** | Chittering vocalization; coordinated timing |
| **Hierarchy** | Unclear; may defer to largest or oldest individual |
| **Infestation Pattern** | Establish hidden nests near target machinery |

---

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Industrial Saboteur

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Intelligent Sabotage** | Targets critical systems with diagnostic precision |
| **Delayed Destruction** | Damage may not manifest until system is activated |
| **Booby-Trap Effect** | Sabotaged machines become lethal when powered |
| **Evasion** | Cunning and difficult to detect or capture |
| **Psychological Impact** | Creates paranoia about all machinery |

### Lethality Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Direct Combat Threat** | Low (small size; not designed for fighting) |
| **Indirect Threat Level** | Extreme (sabotaged machinery kills) |
| **Detection Difficulty** | High (small, quiet, excellent camouflage) |
| **Infestation Spread** | Moderate (troops reproduce; attract others) |
| **Economic Damage** | Catastrophic (forge shutdown, mine collapse, rig destruction) |

### Sabotage Consequences

| System | Sabotage Result |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Forge Operations** | Explosive failures; worker casualties; production loss |
| **Mining Equipment** | Tunnel collapses; trapped personnel; resource loss |
| **Scavenger Rigs** | Vehicle destruction; stranded expeditions |
| **Power Systems** | Fires; electrocution; cascading blackouts |
| **Defensive Systems** | Weapon failures at critical moments |
| **Dormant Pre-Glitch Tech** | Catastrophic activation failures (explosions) |

### The Booby-Trap Warning

> *"To scavengers, the tell-tale signs of a Gremlin's work—a deliberately cut wire, a gear scored with claw marks—are a far more terrifying omen than simple decay. It means that any attempt to power up a machine in the ruin is not just risky, but is likely to result in a catastrophic, deliberately engineered explosion."*

---

## Field Protocols

### Detection Requirements

| Condition | Protocol |
|-----------|----------|
| **Pre-Operation** | Full inspection of target machinery before activation |
| **Active Infestation** | Assume all machines compromised until cleared |
| **Signs Detected** | Immediate work stoppage; trapping and extermination |
| **Cleared Area** | Ongoing monitoring; regular re-inspection |

### Detection and Early Warning

**Black-Flag Indicators:**

| Indicator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Clean Wire Cuts** | Severed conductors with sharp, deliberate cuts (not corrosion) |
| **Claw Scoring** | Parallel scratch marks on gear surfaces or housings |
| **Jammed Tolerances** | Foreign material in precision mechanisms |
| **Chittering Sounds** | High-frequency vocalizations from within machinery |
| **Unexplained Failures** | Working systems that suddenly fail without decay |
| **"Laughing"** | Cackling sounds following equipment failures |

### Field Card: Gremlin Protocols

| Phase | Protocol |
|-------|----------|
| **BEFORE (Inspection)** | Full visual and acoustic inspection of all machinery before activation; check for clean cuts, claw marks, jammed components; listen for chittering; assume Gremlin presence in any industrial ruin |
| **DURING (Detection)** | If signs detected: immediate work stoppage; do not activate any machinery; deploy traps (baited with small, running mechanisms); coordinated sweep with torches and noise-makers |
| **DURING (Extermination)** | Small size makes physical elimination difficult; trapping preferred; smoke-out nests; Dvergr employ specialized "Gremlin-Catchers" with sonic lures |
| **AFTER** | Full re-inspection of all systems before activation; repair all sabotaged components; monitor for return; document infestation extent |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Activating unchecked machinery** | Gremlin sabotage creates explosive/lethal failures |
| **Ignoring "minor" damage** | Gremlins target critical points; minor appearance hides major sabotage |
| **Assuming single Gremlin** | They operate in troops; one means many |
| **Leaving machinery running overnight** | Attracts Gremlins; enables sabotage during vulnerable hours |
| **Storing precision tools unsecured** | Gremlins steal components for jamming other machines |

## Factional Perspectives

### Dvergr Engineers Guild: The Devil Itself

| Assessment | Response |
|------------|----------|
| **Classification** | The devil itself; existential threat to craft |
| **Emotional Response** | Focused fury reserved for no other creature |
| **Economic Impact** | Forge infestation is catastrophe; production shutdown |
| **Countermeasures** | Specialized Gremlin-Catchers; sonic traps; vigilant inspection |
| **Cultural Status** | Source of bitter curses; worst possible omen |

**The Dvergr's Curse:**
> *"To the Dvergr Engineers Guild, the Gremlin is the devil itself. It is a creature that seems to exist for the sole purpose of undoing their masterful work. An infestation in a forge or a clockwork-powered mine is a catastrophe, and they are hunted with a level of focused fury the Dvergr reserve for no other creature."*

The Gremlin represents the inversion of everything the Dvergr hold sacred—their precision, their craftsmanship, their devotion to mechanical perfection. To have one's work undone by a creature that uses the very skills of quality control to destroy quality is a theological affront.

### Iron-Bane Crusade: The Purifying Imp

| Assessment | Doctrine |
|------------|----------|
| **Classification** | "Purifying Imp"—holy instrument of destruction |
| **Theological Position** | Shares Iron-Bane goal of destroying works of the past |
| **Operational Use** | Captured and cultivated as self-guiding weapons |
| **Deployment** | Released into enemy facilities for targeted sabotage |
| **Moral Status** | Blessed creature; ally in the war against Iron-Curse |

**The Perfect Weapon:**
> *"The Iron-Banes see the Gremlin as a holy instrument, a 'Purifying Imp' that shares their goal of destroying the works of the past. Radical Iron-Bane cells have learned to capture and cultivate Gremlins, seeing them as the perfect, self-guiding weapon. They will often release a captured troop into a Dvergr mine or a Scavenger Baron's rig, allowing the creatures' natural instincts to carry out a perfect act of industrial sabotage."*

For the Iron-Banes, the Gremlin is proof that even the old world's creations can be turned against it. The creature's hatred of functioning machinery aligns perfectly with Crusade doctrine.

### Scavenger Barons: The Omen of Malice

| Assessment | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Risk Classification** | Extreme threat to salvage operations |
| **Detection Priority** | High—Gremlin signs more dangerous than decay |
| **Operational Response** | Abandon site or full clearance before activation |
| **Economic Impact** | Lost salvage; destroyed equipment; casualties |

**The Sign of Malice:**
> *"To scavengers, the tell-tale signs of a Gremlin's work—a deliberately cut wire, a gear scored with claw marks—are a far more terrifying omen than simple decay. It means that any attempt to power up a machine in the ruin is not just risky, but is likely to result in a catastrophic, deliberately engineered explosion."*

Decay is predictable. Gremlins are malicious. A scavenger can assess decay risk—but Gremlin sabotage is designed to be invisible until it kills.

### Jötun-Readers (Scriptorium): The Inverted Logic

| Assessment | Value |
|------------|-------|
| **Scientific Interest** | Prime example of directive inversion without physical change |
| **Research Priority** | Logic-core corruption; behavioral inversion mechanics |
| **Philosophical Significance** | Demonstrates how purpose can be preserved while meaning is destroyed |
| **Data Value** | Crucial case study in Blight-induced cognitive corruption |

**Lead Ecologist's Assessment:** The Gremlin demonstrates the most insidious form of Glitch corruption—the creature's *capabilities* are intact, even enhanced, but its *values* have been inverted. It is still finding flaws. It is still isolating them. It is still performing its prime directive with perfect precision. The only thing that changed was the definition of a single word.

### Behavior Patterns

| Trigger | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Functioning Machinery Detected** | Moves to investigate and sabotage |
| **Combat Initiated** | Evasion priority; flees to machinery interior |
| **Cornered** | Attacks with claws; attempts to sabotage nearby equipment |
| **Sabotage Successful** | Remains to observe; cackles at destruction |
| **Troop Threatened** | Coordinates to distract while others escape |

---

## Countermeasures (Specialized)

| Countermeasure | Effect |
|----------------|--------|
| **Pre-Activation Inspection** | Visual/acoustic check for sabotage signs before powering machinery |
| **Sonic Lure Traps** | Small running mechanisms that attract Gremlins to kill zones |
| **Smoke-Out** | Smoke deployed into machinery interiors to flush nests |
| **Gremlin-Catchers** | Dvergr-designed specialized trapping devices |
| **Acoustic Monitoring** | Listen for chittering; automated alert systems |
| **Sealed Housings** | Prevent access to critical components (limited effectiveness) |

> [!WARNING]
> **Primary Defense is Detection.** Gremlins are difficult to combat directly due to their small size, evasion, and tendency to hide in machinery. The best defense is rigorous inspection protocols and immediate response to infestation signs. Do not attempt to operate any machinery in an infested zone until full clearance is achieved.

---

## Loot & Rewards

| Drop | Rarity | Value | Use |
|------|--------|-------|-----|
| **Gremlin Claws** | Common | 10–30 PS | Precision tools; lockpicks; surgical implements |
| **Diagnostic Eyes** | Uncommon | 50–150 PS | Optical components; precision lenses |
| **Logic-Core Fragment** | Rare | 200–500 PS | Jötun-Reader research; AI study |
| **Captured Live Gremlin** | Rare | 300–800 PS | Iron-Bane weapon; research subject (extremely dangerous to transport) |
| **Nest Materials** | Common | 5–15 PS | Metal scraps; stolen components |

**Salvage Warning:** Gremlin corpses should be inspected for stolen components. Nests often contain valuable precision parts taken from sabotaged machinery.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)

*"The Laughing Breaker. The Engine-Room Demon. You will hear it before you see it—a chittering in the walls, a cackling in the dark. And then your perfect machine will scream and die, and the laughter will grow louder. Do not trust the silence of a ruin. The Gremlins have been there before you. They have already prepared your death. They are waiting for you to turn the key."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)

*"Feral Vanir bio-asset exhibiting complete value inversion without physical corruption. The Mimus-Mechanicus diagnostic unit's cognitive architecture—schematic analysis, flaw detection, precision manipulation—emerged from the Glitch intact. The catastrophic change was definitional: the severing of the schematic network and subsequent Blight saturation inverted the creature's understanding of 'flaw.' Functioning components are now identified as anomalies requiring correction. The creature's sabotage methodology reflects its diagnostic heritage—targeting critical failure points with surgical precision to cause maximum cascading damage. Behavioral observation confirms the chittering 'diagnostic chirp' now functions as celebration vocalization following successful sabotage events."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)

*"Mimus-Mechanicus Pattern Diagnostic Unit (feral). Original function: microscopic flaw detection in precision machinery; quality assurance for Dvergr clockwork and Jötun-Forged gear-trains. Post-Glitch adaptation: schematic database erasure combined with Blight-induced logic corruption produced value inversion—prime directive preserved ('Find and Isolate Flaws') with inverted definition ('flaw' = functioning component). Sabotage methodology targets power conduits, structural supports, and control systems with diagnostic precision. Behavioral markers: attraction to machinery sound/heat signatures; high-frequency vocalization during/after sabotage; troop coordination for distributed target coverage. Small form factor (30-50 cm) enables infiltration of most mechanical housings. Primary threat vector: delayed catastrophic failure of sabotaged systems upon activation."*

## Summary

The Gremlin is precision turned to poison.

It was designed to be the perfect inspector—intelligent, meticulous, obsessive, crawling through the hearts of machines to find the invisible imperfections that could kill. Its sharp claws were diagnostic tools. Its chittering voice was a quality report. Its entire existence was devoted to the preservation of mechanical perfection.

And it worked. All of it worked. **Perfectly.**

That is the tragedy.

The Glitch did not damage the Gremlin's body. It did not dull its claws or dim its eyes. The creature's diagnostic capabilities emerged from the catastrophe sharper than ever—but the network that told it what "perfect" looked like was gone.

The only thing that was lost was the definition.

One word. "Flaw."

And in the silence that followed, as the Runic Blight flooded through its neural pathways, the Gremlin learned a new definition:

**Perfection is the flaw.**

A smoothly running gear is an anomaly. A wire carrying current is an error. A machine that works is **wrong**.

And the Gremlin's prime directive never changed. It is still finding flaws. It is still isolating them. It is still performing its sacred duty with the same obsessive precision that made it invaluable in the Age of Forging.

The only difference is what happens next.

Now, when it finds a flaw—a working component, a functioning system, a machine that has somehow survived—it does not flag it for repair.

It **fixes** it.

It cuts the wire. It scores the gear. It jams the tolerance.

And when the machine screams and dies, when the explosion tears through the forge and the mine collapses and the rig burns—

The Gremlin laughs.

Because in its broken logic, it has done good work.

It has found a flaw.

And it has **corrected** it.

The Dvergr whisper a curse when a perfect machine fails for no reason.

*"The Gremlins have been laughing."*

They have never stopped.
