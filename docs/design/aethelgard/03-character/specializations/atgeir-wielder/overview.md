# Atgeir-Wielder (The Line-Holder) — Specialization Specification v5.0

## Identity
> "We do not write the future. We carve the present. You don't fight with rage—you fight with discipline, leverage, and perfect positioning."

## Design Philosophy
The **Atgeir-Wielder** is the disciplined hoplite, the master of formation warfare. Wielding a long polearm, they command the space around them with tactical precision. Their unique **[Reach]** keyword allows them to strike from safety while their Push and Pull effects shatter enemy formations.

Unlike the Berserkr, who channels chaos, the Atgeir-Wielder imposes **Order**. They are the immovable anchor that holds the line, the thinking warrior who controls *where* battles happen. In a chaotic, glitching world, the polearm is logic made physical.

## Mechanics
**Resolution:** MIGHT + d10 vs DC (Standard).
**Damage Tier:** d8 / d10 (Polearm Standard).
**Resource:** Stamina.

### Core Keywords
*   **[Reach]:** Can attack Front Row enemies while standing in the Back Row.
*   **[Push]:** MIGHT vs STURDINESS check to move an enemy from Front to Back Row.
*   **[Pull]:** MIGHT vs STURDINESS check to move an enemy from Back to Front Row.

## Voice Guidance
*   **Tone:** Methodical, weary, disciplined.
*   **Keywords:** Leverage, Anchor, Line, Formation, Distance, Reach.
*   **Avoid:** Rage, frenzy, chaos, magic terms ("spells").
*   **Style:** Technical but ritualistic. "The geometry of the kill," "The rite of the phalanx."

## Synergies

| Synergy Type | Role | Interaction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Positive** | **Berserkr** | You hold the line/tank while they deal damage. You can Pull enemies into their range. |
| **Positive** | **Skald** | Their buffs stack with your Aura defenses. |
| **Negative** | **Rogue/Assassin** | Your chaotic AoE (Line Breaker) can disrupt their positioning if not coordinated. |

## TUI/GUI Display Considerations

*   **Tables:** Must render cleanly in 80-col terminal.
*   **Icons:** Use simple ASCII fallback (e.g., `[|]` for Stance).
*   **Visuals:** In GUI, display "Reach" lines as dotted arcs over allies.
