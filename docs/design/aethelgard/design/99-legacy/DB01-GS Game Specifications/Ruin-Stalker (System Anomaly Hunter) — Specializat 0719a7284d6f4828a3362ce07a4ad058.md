# Ruin-Stalker (System Anomaly Hunter) — Specialization Specification v5.0

## I. Core Philosophy: The Disciplined Entrant

The **Ruin-Stalker** is the Skirmisher specialization that has mastered the deadly art of ruin entry. Where others see crumbling Old World facilities as death traps, you see charted harvest routes, documented anomaly patterns, and survivable extraction protocols. You are the surveyor who reads geometry, sound, and symbol for warning and wealth alike.

To choose the Ruin-Stalker is to embrace the philosophy that **preparation defeats danger**. Your saga is written in mapped corridors, bypassed hazards, and teammates who survived because you entered first. You don't explore ruins—you systematically dismantle their threats.

## II. Player-Facing Presentation

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Role** | Scout, Hazard Navigator, Anomaly Specialist, Trap Expert |
| **Primary Attribute** | WITS (for perception, analysis, and anomaly detection) |
| **Secondary Attribute** | FINESSE (for trap disarmament and precise movement) |
| **Resource** | Stamina |
| **Trauma Risk** | Medium (CPS exposure from anomaly interaction) |

### Gameplay Feel

The Ruin-Stalker is a **methodical utility specialist** who enables safe exploration of dangerous Old World sites. Your operational loop is:

1. **Survey**: Identify anomalies, hazards, and threats before the party advances
2. **Map**: Document safe routes, mark dangers, establish extraction paths
3. **Disable**: Disarm traps, veil dangerous surfaces, bypass active systems
4. **Extract**: Guide the party through with minimal exposure and maximum yield

You operate on the **principle of controlled entry**: timed windows, rotation cadences, and CPS hygiene protocols that keep the party coherent while harvesting from the Age of Forging's carcass.

### The Trade-Off

Your power is **situational**. In ruins, Old World facilities, and anomaly-rich zones, you're invaluable. In open wilderness or standard combat, your specialized toolkit provides less advantage. You trade direct combat power for unmatched exploration utility.

## III. Mechanical Implementation

### A. Core Mechanic: Anomaly Detection & Classification

Ruin-Stalkers can perceive and classify Old World anomalies:

| Anomaly Type | Description | Counter-Protocol |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Echo Surface** | Reflective materials that copy movement/breath | Veil with anti-pattern cloth |
| **Singing Vent** | Repeating tones that pull breath to match | Ear baffles, off-rhythm steps |
| **Animated Script** | Drifting runes responsive to gaze/sound | Cover immediately, call Rúnasmiðr |
| **Loop Corridor** | Architecture that returns in short cycles | Mark and exit; don't argue distances |
| **Frame Residue** | J.T.N. work-prints felt in the teeth | Record with air candles, return with specialists |

### B. Core Mechanic: CPS Hygiene

**Cognitive Paradox Syndrome** is the occupational hazard of ruin work. Ruin-Stalkers maintain strict protocols:

- **Entry windows**: 15-30 minutes maximum first entry
- **Rotation cadence**: Rotate lead observer every 12 minutes
- **Abort criteria**: Any two Stage 1 precursors (auditory paresthesia, semantic drift, looped prosody, fixation)
- **Silent Room protocol**: Dim • Dampen • De-pattern • Document

### C. Core Mechanic: Trap Mastery

Ruin-Stalkers excel at both **disarming** enemy traps and **deploying** their own:

- Superior detection range and success rates
- Can salvage components from disarmed traps
- Unique trap types unavailable to other specializations

## V. Systemic Integration

### Trauma Economy

- **Coherent Specialization**: No heretical mechanics
- **CPS Exposure**: Primary risk from anomaly interaction
- **CPS Resistance** passive mitigates occupational hazard
- **Medium Risk**: Careful play minimizes Stress; reckless entry accumulates it rapidly

### Situational Power Profile

**Optimal Conditions**:

- Old World ruins, facilities, and anomaly-dense zones
- Exploration-heavy sessions with environmental hazards
- Party compositions lacking perception/trap specialists
- Campaigns featuring Jötun-Forged technology and CPS threats

**Weakness Conditions**:

- Open wilderness or standard combat
- Anomaly-free zones with no traps
- Time-pressured scenarios where careful survey isn't viable
- Direct combat against non-trap-related threats

### Synergies

**Positive**:

- **Jötun-Reader**: Your survey + their translation = full site comprehension
- **Bone-Setter**: CPS management and coherence medicine
- **Rúnasmiðr**: You find the inscriptions; they contain or extract them
- **Skjaldmær/Atgeir-wielder**: Hold thresholds while you complete surveys

**Negative**:

- **Aggressive parties**: May not respect your survey cadence
- **Impatient playstyles**: Your value is in preparation, not speed
