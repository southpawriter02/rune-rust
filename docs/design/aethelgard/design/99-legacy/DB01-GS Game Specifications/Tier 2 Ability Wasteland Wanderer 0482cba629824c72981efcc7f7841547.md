## Core Identity

**Wasteland Wanderer** represents your body's adaptation to constant hazards. **Toxins that kill others merely inconvenience you.** Your immune system has adapted, lungs filter corrupted air, skin toughened.

---

## Mechanics

### Always Active

- **Resistance:** Half damage from environmental hazards
- **+1d10** to STURDINESS vs environmental effects
- **+1d10** to resist [Poisoned]/[Disease]
- Can rest in mildly hazardous environments

### Rank Progression

| Rank | PP Cost | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 4 | Base effects (50% reduction) |
| 2 | 20 | Environmental resistance → **75%** reduction |
| 3 | 35 | **Immune** to common environmental hazards, rest in any environment |

---

## Tactical Applications

**Toxic Zone Survival:**

```
Party enters toxic gas zone (10 damage/turn)
Others: 10 damage/turn
Karla (Rank 1): 5 damage/turn (Resistance)

[Poisoned] check vs gas:
Karla: 2d10+4+1d10 = 27 vs DC 18 → SUCCESS!
Others: Afflicted | Karla: Unaffected
```

**Impervious (Rank 3):**

- **Immune** to common environmental hazards (radiation, toxins, disease)
- Explore lethal zones others cannot reach
- Rest anywhere without penalty

**Synergies:**

- **Live off the Land:** Combined = thrive anywhere
- **Extended expeditions:** Ignore environmental barriers
- **Solo exploration:** Scout lethal areas safely

## Failure Modes

<aside>
⚠️

**Overwhelming Damage** — Half of 50/turn still lethal (25/turn). Know environmental magnitude limits. Lava/vacuum bypass even Rank 3.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Novel Threats** — Resistance covers common hazards. Exotic Pre-Glitch bioweapons may bypass standard resistance entirely.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Party Disparity** — Solo immunity enables exploration but party takes full damage attempting to follow. Discoveries may be unretrievable.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Apex Venoms** — +1d10 resistance insufficient vs apex/elite sources (DC 20+). Carry antidotes despite bonuses.
