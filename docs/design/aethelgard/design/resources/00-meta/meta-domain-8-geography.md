# Domain 8 — Geographic Fundamentals: The Nine Realms of a Broken World

> *"The Skalds call them the Nine Realms, the branches of the World-Tree. The truth is simpler and stranger: they are decks. Continent-sized structures stacked by design, not by accident. The gods who built this place were engineers, and their architecture was deliberate. Midgard is not 'above' Jötunheim because of cosmic fate—it is above Jötunheim because that is where the habitation layer was installed."*

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain Classification** | Setting Fundamentals Domain 8 of 9 |
| **Document ID** | AAM-META-SETTING-FUNDAMENTALS-v1.0 (Section 8) |
| **Function** | Canonical geographic governance, realm purposes, biome systems, location validation |
| **Layer Applicability** | All Layers (L1, L2, L3, L4) |
| **Status** | Canonical — Critical for procedural generation, dungeon themes, location descriptions |
| **Validation Requirement** | Mandatory for realm geography, key locations, biome design |

Domain 8 defines **where** things exist in Aethelgard.

The answer is **nine realms**—not eight, not ten. Each realm has a canonical pre-Glitch purpose and a post-Glitch state. These are not arbitrary fantasy locations; they are the functional layers of a planet-spanning megastructure.

## The Nine Realms Baseline

### Core Architecture

| Realm | Deck | Pre-Glitch Purpose | Post-Glitch State |
|-------|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Asgard** | 01 | Primary Administration Spire (Orbital Command) | Shattered Spire; partially crashed; Genius Loci hazard |
| **Vanaheim** | 03 | Primary Bio-Engineering Preserve (Genesis Engine) | Verdant Hell; Gene-Storm mutagen floods |
| **Alfheim** | 04 | Theoretical & Applied Aetheric Research | Supercomputer of Madness; Glimmer psychoactive hazard |
| **Midgard** | 05 | Central Habitation Tier (Engineered Paradise) | Tamed Ruin; heartland of civilization |
| **Svartalfheim** | 06 | Primary Resource Extraction & Fabrication | Kingdom of Controlled Light; Dvergr Hegemony |
| **Jötunheim** | 07 | Grand Assembly Deck (Industrial Production) | Industrial Graveyard; Rust-Clans territory |
| **Muspelheim** | 08 | Primary Power Generation (Geothermal) | Eternal Meltdown; Surtr AI corruption |
| **Helheim** | 09 | Waste Processing & Reclamation | Gangrenous Gut; toxic oceans |
| **Niflheim** | 10 | Strategic Asset & Cryo-Preservation | Frozen Tomb; Fimbulwinter engine |

### Spatial Relationships (Cross-Reference: Domain 1)

| Relationship | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Midgard** | Central habitation deck; clear-ish sun visibility through ash-filled atmosphere |
| **Vanaheim** | Borders Midgard as **adjacent continent** (NOT overhead) |
| **Alfheim** | Hidden atop Vanaheim or connected to Asgard |
| **Asgard** | **Overhead** (orbital command station); crash debris created Asgardian Scar on Midgard |
| **Sub-Midgard Realms** | Jötunheim, Svartalfheim, Helheim, Niflheim, Muspelheim form infrastructure layers beneath |

**Critical v5.0 Correction:**
> Vanaheim and Alfheim are positioned **laterally adjacent** to Midgard, not directly overhead. This preserves sun visibility from Midgard.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"The Skalds sing of the Nine Realms hanging from the branches of the World-Tree—Midgard in the center, Asgard above, Helheim below. They are not wrong, but they are not quite right either. The World-Tree is not a tree. It is a tower, built by the gods to house their perfect civilization. Midgard was the garden they tended; Jötunheim the forge where they built their giants; Helheim the pit where they threw their waste. The Glitch killed the gods, but it did not destroy their architecture. We live in the corpse of their ambition."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"Domain 8 establishes canonical geography for the Nine Realms: Asgard (Deck 01, orbital command), Vanaheim (Deck 03, bio-engineering), Alfheim (Deck 04, research), Midgard (Deck 05, habitation), Svartalfheim (Deck 06, fabrication), Jötunheim (Deck 07, industrial), Muspelheim (Deck 08, geothermal), Helheim (Deck 09, waste), Niflheim (Deck 10, cryo). Realms are continent-sized structures stacked by design, not crash-landed orbital bodies. Vanaheim and Alfheim are positioned laterally adjacent to Midgard (not overhead), preserving sun visibility. Sub-Midgard realms form infrastructure layers."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"REALM REGISTRY: 9 realms (fixed). Deck assignments: Asgard (01), Vanaheim (03), Alfheim (04), Midgard (05), Svartalfheim (06), Jötunheim (07), Muspelheim (08), Helheim (09), Niflheim (10). PRE-GLITCH PURPOSES: Command (Asgard), Bio-Engineering (Vanaheim), Research (Alfheim), Habitation (Midgard), Fabrication (Svartalfheim), Assembly (Jötunheim), Power (Muspelheim), Waste (Helheim), Cryo (Niflheim). SPATIAL: Vanaheim/Alfheim = lateral; Asgard = overhead; Sub-Midgard = infrastructure layers. KEY LOCATIONS: Scriptorium-Primus (Midgard), Asgardian Scar (Midgard), Bifröst remnants (multi-realm), Utgard (Jötunheim), Nidavellir (Svartalfheim)."*

## Integration with Other Domains

| Domain | Relationship to Domain 8 |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **Domain 1 (Cosmology)** | Spatial arrangement; deck architecture; lateral vs overhead positioning |
| **Domain 4 (Technology)** | Pre-Glitch infrastructure status by realm |
| **Domain 5 (Species)** | Species distribution by realm |
| **Domain 6 (Entities)** | Entity concentration by realm (Draugr/Haugbui in Jötunheim, Midgard) |
| **Domain 7 (Reality Rules)** | Blight saturation by realm; CPS exposure risk |

---

## Summary

Domain 8 answers the fundamental question: **Where is everything?**

The answer is **nine realms**—each with a purpose:

| Realm | Purpose | Post-Glitch |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Asgard** | Command | Shattered Spire |
| **Vanaheim** | Life Creation | Verdant Hell |
| **Alfheim** | Research | Supercomputer of Madness |
| **Midgard** | Habitation | Tamed Ruin |
| **Svartalfheim** | Fabrication | Kingdom of Controlled Light |
| **Jötunheim** | Assembly | Industrial Graveyard |
| **Muspelheim** | Power | Eternal Meltdown |
| **Helheim** | Waste | Gangrenous Gut |
| **Niflheim** | Preservation | Frozen Tomb |

These are not fantasy locations chosen for aesthetic variety.

They are the **functional layers of a megastructure**—decks of a continent-spanning installation built by engineers who thought in terms of infrastructure, not mythology.

The mythology came later, after the engineers died.

> *"The World-Tree is not a tree. It is a tower. We are living in the basement."*
