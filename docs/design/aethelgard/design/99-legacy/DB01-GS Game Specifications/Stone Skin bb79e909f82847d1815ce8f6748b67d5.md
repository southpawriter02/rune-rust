## Overview

| Attribute | Value |

| **Ability Type** | Passive |
| **Tier** | 1 (Foundational) |
| **PP Cost** | 3 / 3 / 3 |

## Thematic Description

> *"The flesh learns from the stone; it hardens where the blows fall most."*
> 

Stone Skin represents the Gorge-Maw's **adaptive defense**. Your body has learned to harden in response to trauma, developing stone-like resilience where attacks land. The more you're struck, the tougher you become.

## Mechanical Implementation

### Base Effect (Rank 1)

- **Base Soak**: Gain **+1 permanent Soak**
- **Reactive Hardening**: When you take Physical damage, gain additional **+1 Soak** until end of your next turn
- **Stack Limit**: Temporary Soak stacks up to **+3**

### Rank 2

- **Base Soak**: +2 permanent (up from +1)
- **Stack Limit**: +4 temporary (up from +3)
- **PP Cost**: 3

### Rank 3

- **Base Soak**: +3 permanent
- **Stack Limit**: +5 temporary
- **Duration**: Stacks persist for **2 rounds** (up from 1)
- **PP Cost**: 3

## Soak Stacking Example

### Rank 3 Maximum Soak Buildup

| Source | Soak |
| --- | --- |
| Base Armor | +4 |
| Stone Skin (permanent) | +3 |
| Rooted Stance R3 | +4 |
| Stone Skin (5 stacks) | +5 |
| **Total** | **16 Soak** |

At 16 Soak, most standard attacks deal **0 damage**.

## Synergies

### Internal (Gorge-Maw Tree)

- **Rooted Stance**: Combined Soak creates impenetrable defense
- **Mountain's Endurance**: High Soak delays death trigger
- **Tectonic Fury**: +5 Soak during capstone adds to stacks

### External (Party Composition)

- **Healers**: High Soak means healing goes further
- **Aggro management**: You can afford to hold threat
- **Multi-enemy fights**: More hits = more stacks

---

## Tactical Applications

### Reactive Defense Loop

1. Position in chokepoint
2. Take hits (builds Stone Skin stacks)
3. Take more hits (generates Resonance)
4. Reach maximum Soak (near-invulnerable)
5. Unleash built Resonance in terrain control

### Rank 3: Extended Duration

2-round stack persistence means:

- Stacks build faster than they fade
- Maximum stacks achievable and maintainable
- Brief repositioning doesn't reset defense

## v5.0 Compliance Notes

✅ **Tank Identity**: Core defensive passive

✅ **Reactive Design**: Rewards taking damage

✅ **Stacking System**: Clear cap prevents runaway scaling

✅ **Synergy Design**: Combines with other Soak sources
