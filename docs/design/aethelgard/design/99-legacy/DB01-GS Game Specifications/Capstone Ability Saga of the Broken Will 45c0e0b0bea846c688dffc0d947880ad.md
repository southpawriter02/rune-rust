## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Saga of the Broken Will is the Thul's **ultimate psychological weapon**—a devastating prediction of inevitable defeat so flawlessly constructed that it shatters the target's will to exist. This is the capstone that defines the Thul as the ultimate anti-leader class.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Inflict [Will Broken] — damage halved, Vulnerable to all damage types
- **Secondary:** Ultimate single-target debuff in the game
- **Self-Cost:** Large Psychic Stress from profound mental deconstruction
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The perfectly logical prediction of doom that breaks the spirit

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Extremely high (halved damage + universal Vulnerability)
- **Once Per Combat:** Cannot be spammed
- **Self-Damage:** Large Psychic Stress creates meaningful risk
- **Intelligence Requirement:** Useless against mindless enemies
- **Massive Bonus:** Thul gains huge bonus to ensure success

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Thul does not recite a heroic saga. They recite a **prophecy of doom**.

Step by step, with perfect logical precision, they describe how the target will fall. They name the weakness that will be exploited, the mistake that will be made, the ally that will fail to arrive. Every word is undeniable. Every prediction is flawlessly reasoned.

The target listens—and somewhere deep in their mind, they *believe*. Not because of magic, but because the logic is **perfect**. The argument is unassailable. The conclusion is inevitable.

And in that belief, their will to fight *breaks*.

### Thematic Resonance

This is the Thul's ultimate expression: the weaponization of pure logic. In a world where narrative shapes reality, a perfectly constructed prediction of defeat can *become* defeat.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Activation

- **Action Type:** Standard Action
- **Cost:** 70 Stamina + **large Psychic Stress** (15-20, TBD by system)
- **Range:** 8 meters (voice range)
- **Target:** Single **intelligent** enemy
- **Frequency:** Once per combat

### Resolution

**Opposed Check:**

- Thul rolls: **WITS + Rhetoric + Massive Bonus** (+3 or +4 dice)
- Target rolls: **WILL** (Mental Defense)

### On Success

- Target gains **[Will Broken]** for 3 rounds

### [Will Broken] Effect

- **Damage Output Halved:** All damage dealt by target is reduced by 50%
- **Universal Vulnerability:** Target is **Vulnerable to ALL damage types** (+25% damage taken from everything)
- **Duration:** 3 rounds
- **Cannot be removed:** [Will Broken] persists for full duration (no cleanse)

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Targeting:** Thul selects intelligent enemy within 8 meters
2. **Intelligence Check:** System verifies target is intelligent
3. **Cost Payment:** Thul spends 70 Stamina
4. **Stress Cost:** Thul gains large Psychic Stress (15-20)
5. **Frequency Check:** Verify not already used this combat
6. **Opposed Roll:** Thul (WITS + Rhetoric + massive bonus) vs Target (WILL)
7. **Success/Failure:** On success, apply [Will Broken]; on failure, no effect (but costs still paid)
8. **Duration Track:** [Will Broken] expires after 3 rounds
