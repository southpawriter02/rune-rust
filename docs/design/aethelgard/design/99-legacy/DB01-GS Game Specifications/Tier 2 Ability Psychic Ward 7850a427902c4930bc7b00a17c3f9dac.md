## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Psychic Ward is the Seiðkona's **protective support ability**—a spiritual barrier that shields allies from Psychic damage and mental effects. This establishes their healer/support role by providing meaningful defensive utility.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Grant ally significant Psychic damage resistance
- **Secondary:** Provide bonus to Resolve Checks against mental effects
- **Fantasy Delivery:** Weaving a barrier of benevolent spirits around the protected

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High defensive value (significant Psychic protection)
- **Single Target:** Must choose who to protect
- **Duration:** 3 rounds requires timing and prediction
- **No Psychic Cost:** Can be used freely as primary support action

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Seiðkona reaches out to the spirits that attend them—the friendly dead who linger at the edge of their perception—and asks for their protection. The spirits respond, weaving themselves into an invisible shroud around the target.

To psychic sight, the warded ally is surrounded by a **constellation of pale lights**—the gathered attention of guardian spirits. Any psychic attack must first pass through this barrier of the dead, and the dead are *stubborn* about protecting their chosen.

### Thematic Resonance

Psychic Ward is the Seiðkona using their connection to the dead for protection rather than offense. The spirits serve as shields, their lingering will deflecting the mental attacks that would harm the living.

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Targeting:** Seiðkona selects ally within 8 meters (or self)

## VI. Synergies & Interactions
