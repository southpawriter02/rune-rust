## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Wasteland Wanderer is the Einbúi's **primary environmental defense tool**—representing the hardened resilience of a lifetime navigating toxic ruins. Their body has become **acclimated**, filtering out the worst of the wastes through prolonged exposure.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** +2 dice to STURDINESS Resolve vs Poison/Disease/Environmental
- **Secondary:** Enables confident exploration of hazardous areas
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The survivor whose body has adapted to the wastes

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High (broad defensive coverage)
- **Specific Focus:** Only environmental/toxic threats
- **Exploration Enabler:** Unlocks dangerous biomes

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Einbúi's body is no longer a fragile system susceptible to the world's myriad poisons. Years of exposure have transformed them into a **tough, adaptable organism**. Where others choke on toxic fumes, the Einbúi merely grimaces.

*"That green haze? Corrosive. Stay behind me."*

### Thematic Resonance

Wasteland Wanderer establishes the Einbúi as the party's pathfinder through hostile environments—proof that survival itself is a form of armor.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Resistance Bonus

**Passive Effect:**

- +2 bonus dice to **STURDINESS-based Resolve Checks** against:
    - [Poisoned] status effect
    - [Disease] status effect
    - Environmental Hazard damage ([Toxic Haze], [Acid Pool], etc.)

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Trigger:** Character targeted by qualifying effect
2. **Passive Check:** Does character have Wasteland Wanderer?
3. **Effect Validation:** Is this Poison, Disease, or Environmental?
4. **Bonus Application:** If yes, add +2 dice to Resolve check

---

## IV. Progression Path

### Rank 2 (Expert — 20 PP)

- +4 dice to qualifying Resolve checks

### Rank 3 (Mastery — Capstone)

- +4 dice to qualifying checks
- **New:** Permanent Resistance to Poison damage

---

## V. Tactical Applications

1. **Hazardous Exploration:** Navigate toxic areas safely
2. **DoT Mitigation:** Resist grinding poison damage
3. **Disease Prevention:** Avoid debilitating infections
4. **Party Pathfinding:** Scout dangerous environments for party

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Iron-Blooded Lineage:** Stack bonuses for near-immunity
- **Hazardous biomes:** Essential for Helheim/Jotunheim
- **High STURDINESS:** Reliable defense against DoTs

### Negative Synergies

- **Direct combat:** No bonus against physical attacks
- **Safe environments:** Less value in clean areas
