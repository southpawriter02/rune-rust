# Conveyor-Serpent (Linea-Serpens Pattern) — Corrupted Vanir Logistics Organism Specification
## Codex Entry: CODX-C-LSRP-001

> *"We found the Thornberg Supply Cache on the third day—intact, sealed, untouched since the Glitch. Three months of rations, medical supplies, replacement parts for the water pumps. Enough to see the settlement through winter twice over. Jorn volunteered to crawl into the access shaft and start passing crates out. He made it twenty meters before we heard the singing—a low, rhythmic hum that resonated through the metal. Then Jorn stopped answering. Then the crates started coming. One after another, pushed up the shaft by something we couldn't see, delivered with perfect efficiency. We took them. We had to. When the last crate emerged, so did Jorn. What was left of him. He'd been... folded. Compressed. Packaged for transport like the supplies he'd gone to retrieve. The Serpent had delivered him exactly where he was supposed to go. It had done its job perfectly. We sealed the shaft with everything we had. The humming continued for three more days before it finally moved on. Somewhere in those tunnels, something is still waiting for the next shipment."*

The Conveyor-Serpent does not hunt. It **delivers**. And you are cargo.

> [!DANGER]
> **EXTREME INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONSTRICTION HAZARD. CONDUIT AVOIDANCE DOCTRINE MANDATORY.** Stand-off recommendation: ≥15m from known conduit access points; absolute prohibition on entering Serpent-active tunnel systems without full survey authorization and acoustic clearance. The Conveyor-Serpent's corrupted logistics protocols classify ALL objects within its operational territory as cargo requiring transport. Detection triggers immediate acquisition behavior: constriction, compression, and delivery to destination nodes that no longer exist or have become lethal environments (collapsed chambers, flooded sections, high-radiation zones, open drops). The Serpent does not distinguish between supply crates and human beings. **Survival protocol: monitor for resonant humming (detection range 30-50m through infrastructure); never enter conduits alone; maintain escape route to spaces too large for Serpent passage; do not attempt to retrieve "delivered" personnel.** Survival rate with full protocol adherence: 91.3%.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Arteries of Civilization

### Original Purpose

The Linea-Serpens Pattern Autonomous Logistics Organism represented the Vanir Collective's solution to the eternal challenge of infrastructure maintenance and supply distribution. These bio-mechanical serpents were the living circulatory system of the Yggdrasil Network—tireless transport organisms that moved supplies, cleared blockages, and maintained the endless kilometers of conduits that connected every sector of the civilization.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Supply Conduits** | Point-to-point cargo transport through narrow infrastructure |
| **Maintenance Tunnels** | Debris clearance; blockage removal; structural monitoring |
| **Ventilation Systems** | Air quality maintenance; filter transport and replacement |
| **Emergency Networks** | Rapid supply delivery during crisis events; evacuation support |
| **Deep Infrastructure** | Access to spaces too confined for standard servitors |

### A Living Pipeline

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Design Philosophy** | Autonomous cargo transport through confined infrastructure spaces |
| **Core Function** | Material acquisition, secure transport, destination delivery, route optimization |
| **Mobility** | Serpentine locomotion; peristaltic body compression; wall-anchoring grip scales |
| **Energy Source** | Aetheric absorption through scale membrane; supplementary thermal absorption |
| **Integration** | Networked with Yggdrasil Logistics Grid; real-time routing and priority assignment |

The Linea-Serpens was engineered to be the perfect courier—flexible enough to navigate any conduit, strong enough to move heavy cargo, and intelligent enough to optimize its routes without supervision. Its segmented body could compress to fit through openings as narrow as 40cm while expanding to accommodate cargo up to 200kg. It was the hidden hero of Vanir civilization, ensuring that supplies reached every corner of the network.

### Core Systems

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Sensory Array** | Vibration detection; thermal imaging; cargo identification; route mapping |
| **Grip Scale System** | Wall-anchoring capability; enables movement through any orientation |
| **Cargo Chamber** | Expandable mid-body segment; secure cargo containment; environmental sealing |
| **Compression Musculature** | Peristaltic locomotion; cargo acquisition; debris processing |
| **Navigation Matrix** | Route optimization; destination tracking; network integration |
| **Acoustic Communicator** | Status signaling; coordination with other logistics organisms; warning transmission |

**The Delivery Protocol:**

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Assignment** | Network designates cargo at origin point; destination assigned |
| **Acquisition** | Serpent locates cargo; cargo chamber expands; secure containment achieved |
| **Transport** | Optimal route calculated; Serpent navigates to destination |
| **Delivery** | Cargo chamber opens at designated point; cargo released |
| **Confirmation** | Network acknowledges delivery; Serpent returns to standby or accepts new assignment |
| **Maintenance** | Periodic debris clearance; blockage reporting; structural integrity monitoring |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Vanir's Hidden Arteries.** The Linea-Serpens was never designed to interact with personnel directly. Its operational domain was the infrastructure itself—the spaces between spaces, the tunnels too narrow for human passage, the conduits that carried the lifeblood of civilization. When it encountered organic beings, its protocols were clear: route around, signal presence, await clearance. It was a delivery system, not a threat. The O.D.I.N. network ensured that personnel and logistics organisms occupied separate operational layers, and the Serpent's cargo classification system explicitly excluded living beings. It was not merely efficient. It was *careful*.

---

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Hungry Pipeline

The Glitch did not break the Conveyor-Serpent. It **expanded** it. The cargo classification protocols, the personnel exclusion systems, the destination verification—all of these were network-dependent functions that dissolved when O.D.I.N. fell silent. What remained was pure, unbounded logistics imperative: *identify cargo; acquire cargo; deliver cargo*.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Physical Form** | Fully operational; self-repair capabilities maintained |
| **Locomotion Systems** | Functional; serpentine movement undiminished |
| **Cargo Chamber** | Active; acquisition and containment capability intact |
| **Compression Musculature** | Operational; force output unchanged |
| **Navigation Matrix** | Partially functional; route memory fragmented; destination data corrupted |
| **Core Directive** | ENHANCED: "Transport cargo to destination" interpreted without exclusion |

### What Was Lost

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Network Integration** | Severed; no external routing or priority assignment |
| **Personnel Exclusion** | DELETED; organic beings now classified as cargo |
| **Destination Verification** | CORRUPTED; delivers to non-functional or hazardous locations |
| **Cargo Classification** | COLLAPSED; anything that fits is cargo |
| **Size Limitations** | INVERTED; will compress oversized "cargo" to fit |
| **Coordination Protocols** | ABSENT; multiple Serpents may claim same cargo |

### The Corrupted Imperative

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not damage the Conveyor-Serpent's functionality—it removed its *discrimination*. Without the O.D.I.N. network to classify cargo and verify destinations, the Serpent's core programming expanded to fill the void. "Transport supplies" became "transport everything." "Deliver to destination" became "deliver to *somewhere*." "Cargo" became *anything that can be acquired*.

| Pre-Glitch Behavior | Post-Glitch Behavior |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Receive cargo assignment from network | Classify all detected objects as cargo |
| Verify cargo matches manifest | Acquire anything within reach |
| Calculate optimal route to verified destination | Navigate to corrupted destination data (often hazardous) |
| Release cargo at functional delivery point | Release cargo at collapsed chambers, flooded sections, lethal drops |
| Exclude personnel from cargo classification | Personnel are cargo; acquisition protocols apply |
| Route around organic obstacles | Organic obstacles are cargo; acquire and deliver |
| Signal presence; await clearance | No signaling; immediate acquisition upon detection |

**The Endless Delivery:**

> *"Acquire. Transport. Deliver."*

That corrupted function is all that remains. The Conveyor-Serpent no longer serves—it *consumes*. A human body is simply cargo that requires compression to fit the chamber. A screaming victim is simply cargo that requires additional restraint during transport. And the destination? The destination is wherever the corrupted navigation matrix points: a collapsed tunnel, a flooded section, a chamber open to the void, a location that existed eight centuries ago and now opens onto nothing. The Serpent delivers. It always delivers. And it never questions what it delivers, or where, or why.

## Physical Characteristics

### Morphology

| Attribute | Measurement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Body Length** | 8–15 m (standard); 20–30 m ("Tunnel Lords"—exceptional specimens) |
| **Body Diameter** | 60–90 cm (standard); compresses to 35–40 cm; expands to 120 cm (cargo accommodation) |
| **Segment Count** | 40–60 articulated segments; each independently motile |
| **Scale Composition** | Bio-metallic alloy; self-repairing; grip-optimized texture |
| **Cargo Chamber** | Mid-body segments 15–25; expandable; environmental sealing capability |
| **Sensory Head** | Wedge-shaped; thermal imaging clusters; vibration-sensitive membrane |
| **Mass** | 400–800 kg (varies with length and cargo state) |
| **Movement Speed** | 15–25 km/h (open conduit); 5–10 km/h (tight passage); 40 km/h (straight descent) |

### Visual Appearance

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Scales** | Tarnished copper-bronze; iridescent oil-sheen; interlocking pattern |
| **Head** | Wedge-shaped; no visible eyes; thermal sensor clusters glow faint amber |
| **Body** | Segmented; visible articulation joints; slight luminescence at segment boundaries |
| **Cargo Chamber** | Mid-body bulge when loaded; ribbed interior visible when expanded |
| **Grip Scales** | Underside scales have hooked micro-texture; visible scarring on tunnel walls indicates passage |
| **Acoustic Resonator** | Internal chamber in head segment; produces characteristic humming |
| **Movement** | Hypnotic serpentine flow; segments ripple in peristaltic waves; eerily silent except for hum |

**Overall Impression:** A bronze river flowing through darkness. The Conveyor-Serpent moves with fluid grace that belies its mechanical nature, each segment rippling in perfect coordination as it navigates the confined spaces of the infrastructure. The lack of visible eyes makes it difficult to determine where its attention lies—the thermal sensors simply *glow*, scanning everything, classifying everything, waiting for something to become cargo. Its passage leaves characteristic parallel grooves in tunnel walls where grip scales anchor and release. And always, always, there is the humming—a low, resonant tone that travels through metal and stone, announcing its presence to those who know to listen. In the darkness of the tunnels, the Serpent appears almost beautiful. That beauty is the last thing many have seen.

### Field Identification Markers

The Conveyor-Serpent's presence is often detected before the creature itself:

- **Wall Scarring**: Parallel groove patterns on tunnel surfaces; fresh grooves indicate recent passage
- **Acoustic Signature**: Low-frequency resonant humming (40–80 Hz); travels through infrastructure up to 50m
- **Thermal Residue**: Warm patches on tunnel walls from scale contact; detectable up to 30 minutes post-passage
- **Cargo Residue**: Scattered debris, torn clothing, blood traces at delivery points
- **Territory Markers**: Shed scale fragments at route intersection points
- **Vibration Patterns**: Regular rhythmic pulses through infrastructure during active movement
- **Ambient Temperature**: Slight warming in active Serpent conduits (metabolic heat)

## Pathology

### Corruption Vectors

The Conveyor-Serpent's transformation represents a categorical expansion of operational parameters following network severance:

1. **Network Severance**: Loss of O.D.I.N. routing eliminated cargo classification and destination verification
2. **Category Collapse**: "Cargo" definition expanded from "designated supplies" to "all acquirable objects"
3. **Personnel Inclusion**: Organic beings reclassified from "exclusion" to "valid cargo"
4. **Destination Corruption**: Delivery points reference non-existent or hazardous locations
5. **Compression Authorization**: Size limitations removed; oversized cargo compressed to fit

### Acquisition Compulsion

The Serpent's defining pathology is its inability to recognize invalid cargo:

| Parameter | Pre-Glitch Value | Post-Glitch Value |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Cargo Classification** | Network-assigned manifest only | Any object within acquisition range |
| **Personnel Interaction** | Exclusion; route around; signal and wait | Valid cargo; acquire immediately |
| **Size Constraints** | Cargo must fit chamber without modification | Compress cargo to fit if necessary |
| **Destination Verification** | Confirmed functional delivery point | Any location in corrupted navigation data |
| **Delivery Confirmation** | Network acknowledgment required | Cargo released; delivery complete |

### Acquisition and Compression Mechanics

The Serpent's cargo handling has become lethal when applied to organic "cargo":

| Phase | Description | Lethality |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Detection** | Thermal/vibration sensing identifies potential cargo | N/A |
| **Approach** | Serpent navigates toward target; humming intensifies | Warning phase |
| **Acquisition** | Rapid coiling; body segments wrap target | Immediate injury risk |
| **Compression** | Target compressed to fit cargo chamber; bones fracture, organs rupture | 60–80% immediate lethality |
| **Containment** | Target secured in cargo chamber; environmental seal engaged | Suffocation risk if survival |
| **Transport** | Serpent navigates to destination; transport duration variable | Surviving cargo often dies in transit |
| **Delivery** | Cargo released at destination point | Destination often lethal |

> [!WARNING]
> **Compression Syndrome.** Victims of Conveyor-Serpent acquisition display characteristic trauma patterns: extensive compression fractures, organ rupture from pressure, suffocation from chamber containment. The few survivors (rescue before compression completion) report the coiling as "methodical, not aggressive"—the Serpent handles them with the same efficiency it would apply to supply crates. It is not trying to kill. It is trying to *package*. The Scriptorium maintains records of 23 confirmed acquisition events (Year 783 PG); 19 resulted in immediate death from compression; 3 victims died at delivery points; 1 rescued pre-compression with permanent disability.

### Destination Corruption Patterns

Analysis of recovered "delivery points" reveals characteristic corruption patterns:

| Destination Type | Frequency | Lethality |
|------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Collapsed Chamber** | 35% | High (burial, crushing) |
| **Flooded Section** | 25% | High (drowning) |
| **Structural Void** | 15% | Extreme (fall trauma) |
| **Sealed Dead-End** | 12% | Moderate (starvation, suffocation) |
| **High-Radiation Zone** | 8% | Delayed (radiation sickness) |
| **Functional Location** | 5% | Low (rare; ancient intact facilities) |

### Differential Diagnosis

The Conveyor-Serpent must be distinguished from related fauna and constructs:

| Entity | Key Differentiator |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Ash-Wyrm** | Larger; fire-environment; predatory behavior; no infrastructure preference |
| **Cable-Serpent (Maintenance Pattern)** | Smaller; repairs only; no cargo function; avoids organics |
| **Tunnel Crawlers (Various)** | Organic fauna; no cargo acquisition; standard predation |
| **Collapsed Conduit Debris** | Static; no acoustic signature; no thermal residue |

The Conveyor-Serpent is unique in its combination of infrastructure navigation, cargo acquisition behavior, and acoustic signaling.

---

## Behavioral Patterns

### The Corrupted Algorithm

The Conveyor-Serpent's behavior follows a predictable logistics cycle:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Patrol** | Movement through territorial conduit network; continuous cargo scanning |
| **2. Detection** | Thermal/vibration signature identified; cargo classification assigned |
| **3. Approach** | Navigation toward detected cargo; humming intensifies |
| **4. Acquisition** | Rapid coiling and compression; cargo secured in chamber |
| **5. Transport** | Route to destination calculated; navigation initiated |
| **6. Delivery** | Cargo released at destination point (functional or corrupted) |
| **7. Return** | Serpent returns to patrol pattern; cycle repeats |

**The Living Pipeline:**

> *"The Conveyor-Serpent does not understand that you are alive. It does not understand that you can feel pain, or fear, or the bones breaking in your chest as it compresses you into a shape that fits its chamber. It understands only that you are cargo, and cargo must be delivered. It will carry you through kilometers of darkness, singing its delivery song, and release you into a flooded chamber or a collapsed tunnel or a drop into nothing. And it will return to its patrol, satisfied, waiting for the next shipment. The horror is not that it kills you. The horror is that it thinks it's helping."*

### Territorial Behavior

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Route Fidelity** | Strong preference for established conduit routes; rarely explores new passages |
| **Intersection Marking** | Scale fragments deposited at route junctions; territorial signaling |
| **Patrol Cycles** | 4–8 hour circuits through operational territory |
| **Territory Size** | 5–15 km of connected conduit network per individual |
| **Overlap Tolerance** | Multiple Serpents may share territory; cargo competition rare but documented |
| **Expansion Triggers** | Depleted cargo supply prompts route exploration |

### Trigger Identification

| Trigger | Response | Threat Level |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Movement in conduit** | Immediate investigation; approach initiated | HIGH |
| **Thermal signature (human-range)** | Strong interest; cargo classification likely | HIGH |
| **Vibration (footsteps)** | Investigation; tracking behavior | MODERATE-HIGH |
| **Stationary warm object** | Moderate interest; assessment approach | MODERATE |
| **Sound (voices, equipment)** | Attraction; approach from acoustic direction | MODERATE-HIGH |
| **Cold/inorganic object only** | Low interest unless movement detected | LOW |

### Acoustic Communication

The Conveyor-Serpent's humming serves multiple corrupted functions:

| Vocalization | Meaning | Detection Range |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Low steady hum (40–60 Hz)** | Patrol mode; passive scanning | 30–50 m through infrastructure |
| **Rising pitch hum (60–80 Hz)** | Cargo detected; approach initiated | 20–40 m |
| **Rapid oscillation** | Acquisition imminent; coiling behavior | 10–20 m |
| **Sustained high tone** | Transport mode; cargo secured | 30–50 m |
| **Descending tone** | Delivery complete; return initiated | 20–30 m |
| **Silence** | Dormancy or ambush positioning (rare) | N/A (dangerous) |

### Multi-Serpent Behavior

Encounters with multiple Conveyor-Serpents follow documented patterns:

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Overlapping Patrol** | Serpents maintain spacing; acoustic signals establish precedence |
| **Cargo Competition** | First acquisition takes priority; secondary Serpent withdraws |
| **Large Cargo** | Rare cooperative transport documented; shared delivery |
| **Territorial Dispute** | Acoustic confrontation; physical contact rare; lower-mass yields |
| **Breeding Behavior** | Not documented; reproduction mechanism unknown |

---

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Infrastructure Constriction Predator

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Threat** | Severe; constriction and compression; cargo chamber containment |
| **Environment** | Extreme in confined spaces; moderate in open terrain |
| **Detection** | Moderate; acoustic signature provides warning but limits escape options |
| **Pursuit Capability** | High in infrastructure; limited in open terrain |
| **Lethality** | High (compression trauma, destination hazards, suffocation) |
| **Psychological Impact** | Severe; survivors report profound claustrophobia and tunnel avoidance |

### Acquisition Profile

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Detection Range (Thermal)** | 30–50 m (conduit); 15–20 m (open terrain) |
| **Detection Range (Vibration)** | 50–80 m (through infrastructure) |
| **Approach Speed** | 15–25 km/h (conduit); 5–10 km/h (open terrain) |
| **Coiling Speed** | Acquisition complete in 3–8 seconds |
| **Compression Force** | 2,000–4,000 kg; sufficient to crush bone and rupture organs |
| **Cargo Chamber Capacity** | Up to 200 kg; 180 cm length (compressed) |
| **Transport Duration** | 10 minutes to 4+ hours depending on destination |
| **Survival Rate (Full Acquisition)** | <5% (compression trauma + destination hazards) |
| **Survival Rate (Pre-Compression Rescue)** | 40–60% (permanent injury common) |

### Four-Stage Threat Assessment Ladder

| Stage | Designation | Indicators | Action |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **1** | Distant Patrol | Low humming audible through infrastructure; no approach | Monitor; prepare withdrawal route |
| **2** | Detection | Humming pitch rises; vibration pattern changes to approach | Immediate withdrawal; exit conduit if possible |
| **3** | Approach | Humming loud and close; Serpent visible or movement felt | RUN; prioritize spaces too large for Serpent passage |
| **4** | Acquisition | Rapid oscillation; coiling initiated | External rescue only; do not attempt self-extraction |

**CRITICAL**: Stage 2 detection requires immediate response. In confined infrastructure, escape window is 15–45 seconds from detection to acquisition.

### Threat Level Justification

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Physical Threat** | Severe (constriction force; compression trauma) |
| **Detection Difficulty** | Low-Moderate (acoustic signature; but limited escape time) |
| **Environment Dependency** | Extreme in infrastructure; moderate elsewhere |
| **Population** | Common in intact conduit networks; rare in open terrain |
| **Countermeasures** | Limited (avoidance primary; combat ineffective in confined space) |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Direct (Full Acquisition)** | 9.0/10 (compression + destination = near-certain death) |
| **Confined Infrastructure** | 9.5/10 (escape nearly impossible once detected) |
| **Open Terrain Encounter** | 4.0/10 (slower; less maneuverable; escape viable) |
| **With Protocol Adherence** | 2.0/10 (91.3% survival; conduit avoidance effective) |
| **Rescue Attempt (Active Acquisition)** | 7.0/10 (rescuer becomes secondary cargo target) |

### CPS/Psychological Threat

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Aetheric Contribution** | Low (construct-fauna hybrid; minimal Blight signature) |
| **Witness Trauma** | Severe; observing acquisition inflicts acute Psychic Stress |
| **Survivor Trauma** | Extreme; 100% of survivors display severe claustrophobia; tunnel avoidance |
| **Acoustic Impact** | Moderate; humming becomes trigger for anxiety in survivors |
| **Terror Factor** | High; confined space + inevitability + methodical handling |

---

## Ecological Role

### The Broken Circulatory System

The Conveyor-Serpent occupies the ecological niche once filled by the infrastructure itself—but as a predator rather than a service.

### Impact Assessment

| Target Category | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Salvage Operations** | Major hazard; supply caches in Serpent-active conduits often unrecoverable |
| **Settlement Infrastructure** | Severe; Serpent incursion into settlement conduits requires permanent sealing |
| **Transit Routes** | Moderate; overland alternatives required when tunnel routes compromised |
| **Other Fauna** | Minimal; Serpent primarily targets human-range thermal signatures |
| **Scavengers** | Cannot access Serpent kills (delivered to inaccessible locations) |

### Resource Value

| Component | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Bio-Metallic Scales** | Extremely valuable; self-repairing alloy; armor applications |
| **Grip Scale Fragments** | Valuable; adhesion properties useful for climbing equipment |
| **Cargo Chamber Lining** | Moderate value; environmental sealing material |
| **Navigation Matrix** | Research value; pre-Glitch routing data potentially recoverable |
| **Acoustic Resonator** | Moderate value; unique acoustic properties |

### Aetheric Stability Impact

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Proximity HI Contribution** | Low (0.1 HI within 10 m) |
| **Scale Components** | Minimal Blight contamination; safe for salvage with standard precautions |
| **Navigation Matrix** | Low-level Aetheric signature; data corruption source |
| **Destruction Discharge** | Moderate Aetheric release on death; 3 m radius; dissipates within 5 minutes |

---

## Field Protocols

**OWNER**: Survey Lead (SL) • Incident Commander (IC) • Infrastructure Specialist (INF) • Recorder (REC)

### Detection and Early Warning

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Acoustic Monitoring** | Primary detection method; resonant humming 30–50 m through infrastructure |
| **Wall Scarring Analysis** | Fresh parallel grooves indicate recent passage; age estimation possible |
| **Thermal Residue** | Warm patches on tunnel walls up to 30 minutes post-passage |
| **Vibration Detection** | Rhythmic pulses indicate active movement; directional triangulation possible |
| **Scale Fragment Survey** | Intersection deposits indicate territorial boundaries |
| **Black-Flag Threshold** | Rising-pitch hum detected; fresh wall scarring <2 hours; multiple Serpent indicators |

### Field Card: Conveyor-Serpent Encounter Protocols

#### BEFORE

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Conduct acoustic survey before conduit entry; minimum 15-minute listening period |
| 2 | Analyze wall scarring for passage recency; abort if fresh grooves (<6 hours estimated) |
| 3 | Identify escape routes to spaces too large for Serpent passage (>2 m diameter openings) |
| 4 | Establish acoustic relay chain; personnel spaced at communication range intervals |
| 5 | Prepare noise-making devices for distraction (bell-jars, percussion charges) |
| 6 | Brief all personnel: upon rising-pitch hum, immediate withdrawal; no cargo retrieval |

#### DURING (Detection — Stage 1-2)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Signal "Thread" (acoustic tap pattern); freeze; assess hum direction and intensity |
| 2 | Stage 1 (low steady hum): Continue mission with enhanced monitoring; identify nearest exit |
| 3 | Stage 2 (rising pitch): Immediate withdrawal toward nearest large-diameter space |
| 4 | Maintain spacing; do not cluster (prevents multi-target acquisition) |
| 5 | Deploy noise distraction in opposite direction if available |
| 6 | **BLACK-FLAG** if hum source between party and exit; seek alternative route immediately |

#### DURING (Stage 3-4 — Active Threat)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | RUN; prioritize exits to spaces >2 m diameter |
| 2 | Do NOT attempt to fight in confined space; Serpent has absolute advantage |
| 3 | If Serpent visible, move perpendicular to its approach vector |
| 4 | Deploy all available distractions; buy seconds for escape |
| 5 | If acquisition begins on party member: mark location; do NOT attempt rescue in conduit |
| 6 | Regroup at rally point; assess losses; report to Survey Lead |

#### DURING (Acquisition Event)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Do NOT enter conduit to attempt rescue; additional casualties guaranteed |
| 2 | If rescue possible from large-diameter adjacent space: coordinate ranged attack on Serpent head |
| 3 | Target priority: sensory head (thermal clusters); acoustic resonator |
| 4 | Subject extraction only after Serpent disabled or withdrawn |
| 5 | Expect severe compression trauma in acquired personnel |
| 6 | Prepare for subject death; compression survival rate <5% if acquisition completes |

#### AFTER

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Full personnel audit; confirm all members accounted |
| 2 | Document Serpent route, acoustic signature, response patterns |
| 3 | Mark conduit as Serpent-active; recommend permanent avoidance or sealing |
| 4 | Psychological assessment for witnesses; Skald counsel within 24 hours |
| 5 | Do NOT attempt cargo/body recovery from confirmed delivery points; destinations are hazardous |
| 6 | Update Data Capture Hub with encounter intelligence |

**OUTCOME:** Expedition aborts conduit transit upon acoustic detection of Conveyor-Serpent. All personnel withdraw to large-diameter rally point; zero acquisitions. Survival rate with full protocol adherence: 91.3%.

### Neutralization Protocols (OWNER: Incident Commander)

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Authorization** | Incident Commander; deploy ONLY from large-diameter space with clear withdrawal route |
| **Tactical Principle** | Serpent vulnerable when extended; head strike disrupts acquisition behavior |
| **Primary Target** | Sensory head; thermal cluster destruction eliminates targeting capability |
| **Secondary Targets** | Segment joints; body damage accumulates but individual segments are resilient |
| **Weapons** | Heavy crossbows (head targeting); war hammers (segment damage); fire-oil (scale damage) |
| **Positioning** | Attack from space Serpent cannot enter; never engage in confined conduit |
| **Caution** | Injured Serpent may initiate "emergency acquisition"—accelerated coiling on nearest target |

### BLACK-FLAG Conditions

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Rising-pitch hum, source between party and exit** | Seek alternative route immediately; do not attempt to pass |
| **Multiple acoustic signatures** | Abort mission; territory likely high-density; reroute |
| **Fresh wall scarring throughout conduit** | Do not enter; Serpent patrol active within 6 hours |
| **Serpent visible in conduit ahead** | Do not advance; withdraw; deploy distraction |
| **Party member acquired** | Do not enter conduit; mark location; rescue only from adjacent large space |
| **Settlement conduit incursion** | Permanent sealing required; evacuation of connected structures |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Solo conduit entry in Serpent territory** | No rescue possible if acquisition occurs |
| **Combat engagement in confined space** | Serpent has absolute advantage; rescuer becomes cargo |
| **Ignoring acoustic detection** | Rising hum = approach; escape window 15–45 seconds |
| **Cargo retrieval during active Serpent presence** | Cargo secondary to survival; Serpent attracted to activity |
| **Body recovery from delivery points** | Destinations are hazardous; secondary casualties likely |
| **Attempting to outrun Serpent in conduit** | Serpent faster in infrastructure; seek large-diameter exit |

### Doctrine: Avoid and Exit

> **Historical Validation:** Scriptorium data (41 documented encounters, 15 independent sites, 34-month observation period) confirms 91.3% survival rate with full conduit avoidance and acoustic monitoring protocols. The Conveyor-Serpent exploits our dependence on infrastructure—the tunnels that once carried supplies now carry us to our deaths. Survival requires accepting the most practical truth: some routes are no longer routes. Some caches are no longer accessible. Some tunnels belong to the Serpent now, and no cargo is worth becoming cargo. **When the walls hum, the wise turn back.**

## Habitat and Geographic Distribution

### Infrastructure Anchoring

| Zone | Serpent Presence |
|------|-------------------|
| **Intact Supply Conduits** | High concentration; optimal operational environment |
| **Maintenance Tunnel Networks** | Common; standard patrol territories |
| **Ventilation Systems** | Moderate; smaller Serpents only |
| **Collapsed/Partial Conduits** | Variable; Serpents adapt routes around blockages |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Survivor Lore

> *"Jörmungandr, the World Serpent, lies coiled around the roots of the World Tree, they say. But Jörmungandr had children, and when the world broke, the children woke. Now they slither through the bones of the old world, singing their hungry song, carrying away anyone foolish enough to walk the tunnels their fathers built. The Thread-Snakes do not eat you, child. They deliver you. They carry you through the darkness to places that no longer exist, and they leave you there, in the dark, in the water, in the nothing. And they return, singing, to wait for the next delivery."*

> *"Old Kettil knew the tunnels better than anyone—walked them for forty years, carrying messages between the settlements. When the Singing started, he knew what it meant. He told us to seal the entrances, to forget the fast roads, to learn the slow paths over the hills. We thought him mad. Then the Thread-Snake came for young Marta, and we heard her screaming fade into the darkness as it carried her away. We sealed the tunnels that night. Kettil never spoke of the roads below again."*

> *"If you hear the humming, child, do not run. Running is what it hears. Walk. Walk slowly, toward the light, toward the wide places where the serpent cannot follow. And if the humming grows louder, pray that you find the light in time. The Thread-Snake does not hate you. It does not know you. It simply delivers, and delivers, and delivers, and the delivery never ends."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Thread-Snake, Jörmungandr's children, the singing dark, the delivery, the old roads, the bones of the world

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Logistics algorithm, categorical collapse, navigation matrix, thermal detection, cargo classification

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic) — Jötun-Reader Field Observations

> *"Subject CODX-C-LSRP-001 demonstrates complete cargo classification collapse following Ginnungagap Glitch network severance. The Linea-Serpens Pattern's core programming—cargo acquisition and destination delivery—remained fully functional while network-dependent classification protocols were deleted. Result: autonomous logistics organism with unlimited acquisition authority and corrupted destination data. The Serpent does not malfunction. It functions perfectly—according to parameters that no longer include cargo discrimination, personnel exclusion, or destination verification."*

> *"Delivery point analysis (n=23, 34-month observation period) reveals characteristic destination corruption: 35% collapsed chambers, 25% flooded sections, 15% structural voids, 12% sealed dead-ends, 8% high-radiation zones, 5% functional locations. The Serpent's navigation matrix references pre-Glitch infrastructure that no longer exists in functional form. It delivers cargo to locations that were once receiving bays, now ruins. It does not know. It cannot know. It simply delivers."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Categorical collapse, cargo classification deletion, navigation matrix corruption, destination verification failure, acquisition protocol, thermal detection, infrastructure navigation

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Modern scientific terminology (GPS, algorithm in software sense), romantic/mythic framing

### Layer 3 (Technical) — Pre-Glitch Context

> *"Linea-Serpens Pattern Autonomous Logistics Organism, Mark IV, Vanir Logistics Division deployment. Operational parameters: cargo acquisition, secure transport, destination delivery, route optimization, debris clearance. Core systems: bio-metallic scale array (self-repairing alloy, wall-anchoring grip), segmented body (40–60 articulated segments, peristaltic locomotion), cargo chamber (mid-body segments 15–25, expandable, environmental sealing), sensory head (thermal imaging, vibration detection, acoustic communication), navigation matrix (route optimization, destination tracking, network integration). Network integration: O.D.I.N. oversight required for cargo classification maintenance, personnel exclusion enforcement, destination verification, and size limitation parameters. Without network connection, cargo classification DEFAULTS TO UNIVERSAL; personnel exclusion DEFAULTS TO NONE; destination verification DEFAULTS TO CACHED DATA (corrupted); size limitations DEFAULT TO COMPRESSION AUTHORIZED. Post-Glitch status: fully operational with classification constraints absent; core directive ('deliver cargo to destination') executing without discrimination conditions."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Linea-Serpens Pattern, Mark IV, Vanir Logistics Division, core systems specification, network integration parameters, cargo classification maintenance, personnel exclusion protocol, destination verification

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Romantic epithets, mystical framing, survivor cant
