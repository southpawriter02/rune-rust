# Hela-Caste Custodian Program — Huscarl-Class Bio-Augments
## Codex Entry: CODX-P-HELA-001

> *"The mortuary workers found him in the third sub-basement—standing guard over a cryogenic vault that had been breached six centuries ago. He didn't move when they entered. Didn't acknowledge their lights or their voices. Just stood there, hands folded, watching an empty room with eyes that had long since clouded to milk-white cataracts. They thought he was dead. A corpse that had somehow remained upright through seven hundred years of silence. Then one of the workers reached for the vault controls, and the corpse moved. Faster than anything that old should move. Faster than anything alive should move. It took his hand off at the wrist—a single motion, surgical, precise—and returned to its position before the screaming started. It didn't speak. It didn't threaten. It simply guarded. After all this time, with nothing left to protect, it simply guarded. We sealed that sub-basement. We don't go back. Some duties outlast the world that assigned them."*
> — Chief Salvager Bjorn Rust-Hand, Asgard Deep Reclamation Team, Year 768 PG

The Hela-Caste Custodian is not a monster. It is a **promise kept past the death of the world**.

> [!DANGER]
> **EXTREME PHYSICAL HAZARD. NON-ENGAGEMENT DOCTRINE MANDATORY FOR NON-SCRIPTORIUM PERSONNEL.** Stand-off recommendation: ≥50m from any suspected custodial post. Do not approach secured areas. Do not attempt communication. Do not touch anything a Custodian appears to be guarding. Survival rate with protocol adherence: 99.1%. Survival rate with protocol violation: 23.4%.

The Hela-Caste Custodians were humanity's answer to a simple question: who guards the most precious things when no one is watching? The Architects' answer was to create humans who would never stop watching—bio-augmented guardians designed for eternal vigilance over secure facilities, sacred spaces, and irreplaceable archives. Seven centuries after the Glitch killed their masters and destroyed the civilization they served, some of them are still on duty. **They do not know the war is over. They do not know their charges are dust. They only know their post. And they will hold it forever.**

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Eternal Guardians

### Program Genesis

The Hela-Caste Custodian Program emerged from a fundamental limitation of automated security: machines could be hacked, subverted, or disabled. The Architects needed guardians who could not be remotely compromised—guardians whose loyalty was written into their biology rather than their software.

| Development Phase | Timeline | Milestone |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|
| **Conceptualization** | Year 487 BG | O.D.I.N. Matrix identifies security gap in critical infrastructure protection |
| **Initial Research** | Years 485–470 BG | Vanir Collective bio-engineering teams begin augmentation feasibility studies |
| **Prototype Program** | Years 470–455 BG | First-generation Custodians deployed to Asgard administrative facilities |
| **Standardization** | Years 455–430 BG | Huscarl-Class augmentation protocol finalized; mass deployment begins |
| **Full Integration** | Years 430 BG–Glitch | Hela-Caste becomes standard security solution for highest-security installations |

### Original Purpose

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Cryogenic Preservation Facilities** | Guardianship of suspended individuals awaiting medical advancement |
| **Genetic Archive Vaults** | Protection of irreplaceable biological repositories |
| **Memorial Complexes** | Custodianship of deceased dignitaries and cultural figures |
| **Administrative Archives** | Security for governance records and historical documentation |
| **Research Repositories** | Protection of dangerous or sensitive scientific materials |
| **Sacred/Cultural Sites** | Guardianship of locations of profound cultural significance |

### The Volunteer Covenant

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Recruitment Philosophy** | Voluntary service only; candidates fully informed of augmentation consequences |
| **Candidate Profile** | Terminal patients, those without family obligations, individuals seeking meaningful legacy |
| **Compensation** | Complete care for any dependents; memorialization as honored servants |
| **Psychological Screening** | Rigorous evaluation for stability, dedication, acceptance of transformation |
| **Consent Protocol** | Multiple confirmation stages; 90-day reflection period mandatory |

The Hela-Caste program was not slavery. It was sacrifice.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Covenant of Service.** Every Custodian chose their fate. They were typically individuals facing terminal diagnoses who wished their remaining existence to have meaning, or those without family ties who sought purpose beyond ordinary life. The Architects offered them a bargain: surrender your remaining years of natural life, and we will give you centuries of purposeful service. Your body will be transformed. Your lifespan will be extended beyond natural limits. You will stand guard over things that matter—the preserved bodies of loved ones awaiting resurrection, the genetic heritage of endangered species, the accumulated wisdom of civilization. You will be remembered. You will have mattered. **They said yes. They all said yes.**

## Augmentation Protocol: The Huscarl Transformation

### Bio-Engineering Overview

The Huscarl-Class augmentation was not cybernetic enhancement—it was biological reconstruction. The subject's body was systematically modified at the cellular level to create a human optimized for one purpose: eternal vigilance.

| System | Modification |
|--------|--------------|
| **Musculoskeletal** | Reinforced bone density (+340%); enhanced muscle fiber efficiency; joint articulation optimization |
| **Cardiovascular** | Redundant circulatory pathways; blood chemistry modification for extended oxygen efficiency |
| **Neurological** | Sensory enhancement suite; threat-response acceleration; pain perception attenuation |
| **Metabolic** | Extreme efficiency modification; minimal caloric requirement; hibernation capability |
| **Integumentary** | Dermal reinforcement; thermal regulation enhancement; accelerated wound healing |
| **Endocrine** | Aggression regulation; fear suppression; alertness maintenance |
| **Immune** | Pathogen resistance amplification; toxin neutralization enhancement |

### Augmentation Stages

| Stage | Duration | Process |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **1. Preparation** | 30 days | Genetic mapping; baseline documentation; psychological conditioning |
| **2. Skeletal Reconstruction** | 90 days | Bone density enhancement; joint modification; structural reinforcement |
| **3. Muscular Enhancement** | 60 days | Fiber replacement; efficiency optimization; strength amplification |
| **4. Neurological Integration** | 120 days | Sensory enhancement; reflex acceleration; cognitive modification |
| **5. Metabolic Restructuring** | 90 days | Efficiency optimization; hibernation capability installation |
| **6. System Integration** | 60 days | Full-body coordination; capability testing; psychological stabilization |
| **7. Conditioning** | Variable | Post-specific training; facility familiarization; protocol imprinting |

**Total Transformation Duration:** 15–18 months

### Capability Specifications

| Attribute | Pre-Augmentation | Post-Augmentation | Enhancement Factor |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Strength** | Human baseline | 4.2× baseline | 420% |
| **Speed (Reaction)** | 250ms average | 45ms average | 556% |
| **Speed (Movement)** | 28 km/h sprint | 68 km/h sprint | 243% |
| **Endurance** | 8–12 hours sustained activity | 72+ hours sustained activity | 600%+ |
| **Lifespan** | 80–120 years | 800–1200 years (theoretical) | 1000% |
| **Sensory Acuity** | Human baseline | 3× visual, 4× auditory, 2× olfactory | Variable |
| **Pain Tolerance** | Human baseline | 90% attenuation | N/A |
| **Caloric Requirement** | 2000–2500 kcal/day | 200–400 kcal/day (active) / 50 kcal/day (dormant) | 10–20% |

### Operational Parameters

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Duty Cycle** | Continuous (no sleep requirement; micro-rest distributed throughout day) |
| **Alert State Duration** | Indefinite (designed for centuries of uninterrupted vigilance) |
| **Hibernation Capability** | Can enter low-metabolism state during resource scarcity; awakens on intrusion |
| **Communication** | Full speech capability retained; typically reserved for warnings and reports |
| **Decision Authority** | Autonomous within defined parameters; escalation protocols for ambiguous situations |
| **Lethal Force Authorization** | Pre-authorized for defined intrusion scenarios; graduated response capability |

### The Cost of Transformation

| Sacrifice | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Reproductive Capability** | Eliminated (metabolic resources redirected) |
| **Emotional Range** | Attenuated (fear, anxiety, loneliness suppressed; dedication, duty, satisfaction retained) |
| **Social Integration** | Diminished (extended isolation tolerance requires reduced social needs) |
| **Physical Sensation** | Reduced (pain attenuation extends to pleasure; food, comfort become functional rather than experiential) |
| **Personal Identity** | Modified (individual personality subordinated to custodial purpose; name often replaced with designation) |
| **Natural Death** | Surrendered (Custodians do not age normally; death comes only through violence or systemic failure) |

> *"They told me I would live for a thousand years. They didn't tell me that after fifty, I would struggle to remember what joy felt like. After a hundred, I stopped trying. It doesn't hurt—they made sure of that. It simply... doesn't matter anymore. The vault matters. The archive matters. My feelings do not. I think that's what they intended. I think they were right to intend it."*
> — Custodian Designation THR-447, personal log fragment, Year 12 BG

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Abandoned Sentinels

The Glitch did not target the Custodians specifically—it simply made them irrelevant. The civilization they protected collapsed. The institutions they served ceased to exist. The people they guarded died or fled. And the Custodians remained at their posts, waiting for orders that would never come.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Physical Augmentations** | Fully intact; biological modifications self-maintaining |
| **Sensory Enhancement** | Operational; threat detection capability unimpaired |
| **Combat Capability** | Preserved; response protocols functional |
| **Metabolic Efficiency** | Active; extreme resource conservation ongoing |
| **Core Programming** | Intact; custodial imperatives continue to drive behavior |
| **Hibernation Capability** | Functional; many Custodians entered low-metabolism state |

### What Was Lost

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Command Authority** | Severed; no valid orders received since Glitch |
| **Network Integration** | Destroyed; Yggdrasil coordination eliminated |
| **Support Infrastructure** | Collapsed; no maintenance, resupply, or relief |
| **Mission Context** | Obsolete; protected assets often destroyed or irrelevant |
| **Relief Protocol** | Unreachable; replacement Custodians never arrived |
| **Purpose Validation** | Absent; no authority exists to confirm mission completion |

### Post-Glitch Status Distribution

| Status | Estimated Percentage | Description |
|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Active (On Post)** | 5–8% | Continuous duty at original station; highest threat level |
| **Dormant (Hibernating)** | 15–20% | Low-metabolism state; awakens on intrusion detection |
| **Wandering** | 2–3% | Post abandoned or destroyed; Custodian seeks new purpose |
| **Deceased** | 60–70% | Killed by Glitch effects, environmental factors, or violence |
| **Unknown** | 5–10% | Insufficient data; likely in inaccessible locations |

### The Unchanged Mandate

The Custodians' augmented neurology includes what the Architects called "purpose anchoring"—a deep biological modification that makes abandoning their assigned duty almost physically impossible. Even seven centuries after the Glitch, even with full awareness that their charges may be dust and their masters dead, **they cannot leave**. Their bodies will not permit it. Their minds will not conceive it. They are prisoners of their own dedication.

| Pre-Glitch Protocol | Post-Glitch Manifestation |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Guard assigned location | Guard assigned location (even if empty/destroyed) |
| Permit authorized personnel | No personnel can be authorized (authority structure destroyed) |
| Prevent unauthorized access | Prevent ALL access (no authorization possible) |
| Report intrusions | No reporting capability (Network severed) |
| Request relief when incapacitated | No relief available (program terminated) |
| Await new orders | Await forever (no command authority exists) |

---

## Physical Characteristics

### Morphology

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Height** | 175–195 cm (augmentation does not significantly alter height) |
| **Weight** | 95–140 kg (increased bone and muscle density) |
| **Build** | Lean but dense; visibly muscular without bulk; efficient rather than impressive |
| **Skin** | Pale, often grey-tinged from reduced circulation; dermis visibly toughened |
| **Eyes** | Frequently clouded or discolored from centuries of exposure; enhanced function despite appearance |
| **Hair** | Often absent or white; metabolic resources not allocated to cosmetic features |
| **Apparent Age** | Difficult to assess; features frozen at augmentation age but weathered by centuries |

### Visual Appearance

| State | Indicators | Threat Level |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Active Alert** | Standing/patrolling; eyes tracking; subtle movement | Extreme |
| **Passive Watch** | Standing still; eyes fixed; no visible motion | High |
| **Dormant** | Standing or seated; eyes closed or unfocused; minimal respiration visible | Moderate (awakens instantly) |
| **Degraded** | Visible wounds, missing limbs; compromised mobility; may be non-functional | Variable |
| **Deceased** | Prone or collapsed; no response to stimuli; decomposition present | None |

**Overall Impression:** A Custodian in good condition appears disturbingly human—and disturbingly *wrong*. The proportions are correct, the features recognizable, but something fundamental is absent. They do not fidget. They do not shift weight. They do not blink at normal intervals. They simply *are*—present in a space with the same passive intensity as a statue, but a statue that watches you with eyes that still function despite their milky opacity. The uncanny stillness is often more disturbing than any monstrous appearance would be. You are being watched by something that was once a person and is now something else—something that has been waiting in silence for longer than your entire civilization has existed.

### Equipment and Attire

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Uniform** | Originally standardized jumpsuits in facility colors; now faded, patched, or replaced with salvage |
| **Weapons** | Purpose-designed restraint tools; many Custodians now carry salvaged weapons |
| **Identification** | Designation tattoos (neck, wrist); facility assignment markings; some wear corroded badges |
| **Personal Effects** | Rare; some Custodians retain pre-transformation keepsakes |
| **Maintenance Supplies** | Many carry basic medical/repair supplies scavenged over centuries |

### Degradation Patterns

| System | Degradation Timeline | Effect |
|--------|---------------------|--------|
| **Visual Acuity** | 200–400 years | Lens clouding; function maintained via enhanced processing |
| **Dermal Integrity** | 300–500 years | Scarring accumulation; cosmetic only |
| **Joint Function** | 400–600 years | Reduced flexibility; compensated by strength |
| **Cognitive Function** | 500–800 years | Memory gaps; personality erosion; duty focus intensifies |
| **Metabolic Efficiency** | 600–900 years | Increased caloric requirement; hibernation periods lengthen |
| **Systemic Failure** | 800–1200 years | Cascading organ failure; death |

---

## Behavioral Patterns

### The Custodial Algorithm

Custodian behavior follows predictable patterns derived from their original programming:

| Phase | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **1. Observation** | Continuous environmental monitoring; threat assessment |
| **2. Warning** | Verbal command to halt/withdraw; may be repeated 1–3 times |
| **3. Positioning** | Movement to intercept potential intrusion vector |
| **4. Engagement** | Physical intervention if warning ignored; graduated force |
| **5. Neutralization** | Incapacitation or elimination of threat |
| **6. Return** | Resume observation position; await next stimulus |

### Warning Protocols

| Intrusion Level | Response |
|-----------------|----------|
| **Proximity (50m)** | Alert state; tracking; no intervention |
| **Approach (20m)** | First warning: "This area is restricted. Do not proceed." |
| **Encroachment (10m)** | Second warning: "Final warning. Withdraw immediately." |
| **Violation (<10m or contact with protected asset)** | Physical intervention; force escalates to threat level |

> [!CAUTION]
> **Warning Protocol Degradation.** Custodians who have been on post for 400+ years often show abbreviated warning sequences—or none at all. The social cognition required for graduated response degrades faster than combat capability. Older Custodians may proceed directly from observation to lethal engagement. **Do not assume you will receive a warning.**

### Communication Patterns

| Context | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Warning** | Clear, loud verbal commands; often archaic Pre-Glitch phrasing |
| **Interrogation** | May demand identification, authorization codes (none valid) |
| **Confusion** | Some Custodians ask about current date, facility status, personnel |
| **Lucidity** | Rare moments of apparent self-awareness; quickly suppressed by programming |
| **Silence** | Many Custodians have not spoken in centuries; voice capability may be degraded |

### Territorial Behavior

| Zone | Definition | Response to Intrusion |
|------|------------|----------------------|
| **Core Protected Area** | The specific asset/location originally assigned | Lethal force immediate |
| **Buffer Zone** | Surrounding area controlling access | Warning, then escalating force |
| **Patrol Territory** | Extended area Custodian monitors | Observation; warning if approach continues |
| **External Area** | Beyond custodial responsibility | No response (may not be aware of intrusion) |

### Cognitive Degradation Behaviors

| Symptom | Manifestation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Repetitive Patrol** | Same route walked continuously for decades; worn paths visible in flooring |
| **Phantom Reporting** | Speaking reports to non-existent supervisors |
| **Identity Confusion** | May address intruders as former colleagues or loved ones |
| **Purpose Fixation** | Increasingly rigid interpretation of protective mandate |
| **Time Distortion** | Belief that Glitch was recent; confusion about elapsed time |
| **Memory Fragmentation** | Unable to recall own name, transformation, or original life |

---

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Bio-Augmented Security Asset

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Physical Threat** | Extreme; enhanced strength, speed, and combat training |
| **Predictability** | Moderate; behavior follows protocols but degradation introduces variance |
| **Communication** | Limited; warnings may be absent or nonsensical |
| **Negotiation** | Extremely difficult; no valid authorization codes exist |
| **Avoidance** | Highly effective; Custodians rarely pursue beyond territory |
| **Neutralization** | Difficult; enhanced durability and pain tolerance |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Direct Combat** | 9.2/10 (enhanced physical capability; centuries of experience) |
| **Ambush (Dormant Custodian)** | 8.5/10 (instant awakening; victim typically unaware of threat) |
| **Territorial Defense** | 9.5/10 (optimal conditions; knows environment perfectly) |
| **Pursuit** | 6.0/10 (rarely pursue beyond territory; enhanced speed if they do) |
| **With Avoidance Protocol** | 0.9/10 (99.1% survival rate with proper doctrine) |

### Combat Capability Assessment

| Attribute | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Unarmed Lethality** | Extreme | Can crush bone, tear muscle; precision strikes |
| **Armed Capability** | High | Trained with Pre-Glitch restraint tools; adapts to salvaged weapons |
| **Durability** | Very High | Can sustain wounds that would incapacitate normal humans |
| **Pain Response** | Minimal | 90% attenuation; fights through injuries |
| **Tactical Intelligence** | Moderate | Combat protocols intact; strategic adaptation limited |
| **Coordination** | None (usually) | Custodians operate independently; rare pairs at high-security sites |

### Engagement Statistics

| Scenario | Survival Rate |
|----------|---------------|
| **Protocol Adherence (avoidance)** | 99.1% |
| **Accidental Intrusion (warning received, withdrawal)** | 87.3% |
| **Deliberate Intrusion (combat capable team)** | 23.4% |
| **Deliberate Intrusion (unprepared individuals)** | 4.2% |
| **Scriptorium Diplomatic Contact (trained operators)** | 94.6% |

### Threat Level Justification

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Physical Threat** | Extreme (bio-augmented combat capability) |
| **Encounter Predictability** | High (fixed locations; territorial) |
| **Detection Difficulty** | Moderate (dormant Custodians may appear deceased) |
| **Avoidance Potential** | High (territorial limits; do not pursue) |
| **Neutralization Difficulty** | Very High (durability; pain tolerance; will to fight) |
| **Population** | Low (estimated 2,000–5,000 active/dormant individuals) |

---

## Field Protocols

### Detection and Assessment

| Method | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Environmental Survey** | Identify high-security Pre-Glitch installations (vaults, archives, memorial complexes) |
| **Territorial Markers** | Look for worn patrol paths, arranged debris, maintained clear zones |
| **Dormant Identification** | Bodies in standing/seated positions; no decomposition; preserved equipment |
| **Active Detection** | Movement at consistent patrol intervals; response to noise/light stimuli |
| **Auditory Cues** | Footsteps at regular intervals; breathing (slow, regular); occasional vocalization |

### Field Card: Hela-Caste Custodian Encounter Protocol

**OWNER:** Expedition Lead (EL) • Security Specialist (SS) • Medical Support (MS) • Recorder (REC)

| Phase | Protocol |
|-------|----------|
| **BEFORE (Reconnaissance)** | Identify facility type; assess Custodian presence likelihood; establish 50m observation perimeter; survey for patrol patterns (minimum 4-hour observation); identify buffer zones and core protected areas; map withdrawal routes; confirm all personnel briefed on warning protocol recognition; prepare non-aggressive posture signals |
| **DURING (Contact Avoidance)** | Maintain 50m minimum distance from suspected posts; move slowly, predictably, non-threateningly; avoid direct approach to vault doors, display cases, or obvious high-value areas; if patrol detected, freeze and allow passage; do not make eye contact with active Custodians (interpreted as challenge); use peripheral routes around protected zones |
| **DURING (Warning Response)** | Upon verbal warning: HALT IMMEDIATELY; announce non-hostile intent clearly and slowly; begin slow withdrawal while maintaining non-threatening posture; do not run (triggers pursuit response); do not turn back on Custodian; continue withdrawal until warning zone exited (typically 20–30m); do not re-approach same vector |
| **DURING (Engagement—Emergency Only)** | If physical engagement unavoidable: concentrated fire from multiple vectors; target mobility (leg joints) before attempting lethal damage; expect continued combat capability after wounds that would stop normal humans; maintain withdrawal pressure—drive back toward protected zone, not away from it (Custodians rarely pursue past territory); fire-based weapons most effective (pain attenuation does not apply to thermal regulation instinct) |
| **AFTER (Documentation)** | Log Custodian location, appearance, behavior patterns, territory extent; note any communication or apparent lucidity; assess facility value vs. Custodian threat for future expeditions; report to Scriptorium if diplomatic contact candidate identified |

**OUTCOME:** Expedition transits Custodian-guarded area without casualties via avoidance protocol. Custodian presence documented for future reference. Facility access deferred pending Scriptorium diplomatic assessment.

### Scriptorium Diplomatic Protocol

The Jötun-Reader Scriptorium maintains specialized teams trained in Custodian contact. In rare cases, dialogue is possible:

| Approach Element | Specification |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Personnel** | Trained Custodian Contact Specialists only; minimum 2-person team |
| **Approach Vector** | Slow, visible, hands empty, from designated entry points |
| **Communication** | Pre-Glitch formal register; use of Architect-era terminology |
| **Identification** | Presentation of Scriptorium credentials (some Custodians recognize research authority) |
| **Request Frame** | "Inspection" or "Documentation" rather than "Access" or "Removal" |
| **Success Rate** | 38% achieve limited cooperation; 56% achieve withdrawal without violence; 6% result in engagement |

### BLACK-FLAG Conditions

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **No Warning Issued** | Assume degraded Custodian; extreme caution; avoid all approach |
| **Multiple Custodians** | Paired posts indicate high-value facility; avoid entirely without Scriptorium support |
| **Pursuit Beyond Territory** | Catastrophic degradation; disengage by any means; report location for containment |
| **Lucid Communication** | Potentially valuable contact; do not exploit; report to Scriptorium immediately |
| **Custodian Requests Information** | May indicate tractability; provide truthful, calming responses; do not lie (Custodians detect deception) |
| **Custodian Appears Confused** | Do not approach; confusion may resolve into aggression; maintain distance |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Attempting to "Free" Custodian** | Purpose anchoring is biological; cannot be overridden; attempt triggers defensive response |
| **Impersonating Authority** | Custodians recognize no valid authority; deception interpreted as threat |
| **Offering Food/Water** | May be interpreted as insult or contamination attempt |
| **Touching Protected Assets** | Immediate lethal response regardless of other factors |
| **Attempting Capture** | Extreme danger; Custodians will sustain lethal damage to escape confinement |
| **Displaying Weapons** | Escalates threat assessment; may bypass warning protocol |

### Doctrine: The Respect of Distance

> **Historical Validation:** Scriptorium encounter data (312 documented contacts, 47 facilities, 94-year observation period) confirms 99.1% survival rate with avoidance protocol adherence. The Custodians are not enemies. They are not obstacles. They are the last faithful servants of a dead civilization, still keeping promises no one remembers asking them to make. **We do not fight them. We do not mock them. We do not pity them. We respect them—from a distance. And we leave them to their vigil.**

## Encounter Zones and Distribution

### Facility Type Correlation

| Facility Type | Custodian Presence Probability | Typical Deployment |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Cryogenic Preservation Vault** | 85% | 1–2 Custodians per vault |
| **Genetic Archive** | 90% | 2–4 Custodians; highest security |
| **Memorial Complex** | 70% | 1–3 Custodians; often degraded |
| **Administrative Archive** | 60% | 1–2 Custodians |
| **Research Repository** | 75% | 2–4 Custodians; may include specialized protocols |
| **Residential Complex** | 15% | Rare; only for high-status individuals |
| **Commercial Facility** | 5% | Very rare; only for irreplaceable assets |

### Geographic Distribution

| Realm | Presence | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Asgard** | Highest | Administrative and governance archives; memorial complexes |
| **Niflheim** | High | Cryogenic facilities; long-term preservation vaults |
| **Vanaheim** | Moderate | Research repositories; genetic archives |
| **Midgard** | Low | Scattered high-security sites; some memorial complexes |
| **Jötunheim** | Very Low | Industrial facilities rarely warranted Custodian protection |
| **Muspelheim** | Minimal | Environmental conditions hostile to extended deployment |
| **Alfheim** | Low | Research sites; some cultural preservation facilities |

### Environmental Factors

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Intact Facility** | Custodian likely functional; original protocols operative |
| **Partially Collapsed** | Custodian may be trapped, degraded, or patrolling rubble |
| **Flooded/Frozen** | Custodians can survive extreme conditions; hibernation likely |
| **High Blight Contamination** | Custodian may be affected; behavior unpredictable |
| **Scavenger Activity** | Previous intrusion may have resulted in casualties; Custodian on high alert |

## Factional Perspectives

### Common Folk & Skalds: Undead Guardians — "The Standing Dead"

The common folk view Custodians as a form of undead—corpses that refuse to lie down.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Draugr; cursed servants bound to eternal duty |
| **Cultural Role** | Cautionary tales; "do not disturb the resting places of the Before-Time" |
| **Mythology** | "The Architects bound souls to guard their treasures; the souls cannot rest until released" |
| **Response** | Avoidance; marking of dangerous sites; prayers for the "trapped spirits" |
| **Skaldic Name** | "Hela's Chosen"; "The Patient Dead"; "Grave-Keepers" |

### Jötun-Readers (Scriptorium): Living Archives — "Project Helheim Subjects"

For the Scriptorium, Custodians are invaluable—living witnesses to the Pre-Glitch world, and guardians of knowledge that might otherwise be lost.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Bio-augmented humans; pre-Glitch security assets; potential information sources |
| **Research Value** | Direct testimony of pre-Glitch society; protection of archives; augmentation study |
| **Diplomatic Efforts** | Specialized contact teams attempt communication; 38% success rate |
| **Ethical Position** | Custodians deserve respect as individuals who sacrificed for duty |
| **Doctrine** | "They are not obstacles to the Great Work. They are part of it—the last living pieces of the world we study." |

### Iron-Banes: Corrupted Abominations — "Flesh-Puppets"

The Iron-Banes view Custodians as humanity twisted by Architect arrogance—living evidence of why the old world deserved to fall.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Aether-tainted abominations; victims of Architect hubris |
| **Theological Position** | "The Architects made slaves of their own kind; this is their greatest sin" |
| **Policy** | Destruction when encountered (rarely successful); avoidance otherwise |
| **Mercy Doctrine** | Some orders believe Custodians should be "released" through death |
| **Concern** | Custodians guard Pre-Glitch technology that should remain buried |

### Dvergr Guilds: Engineering Marvels — "The Unending"

The Dvergr view Custodians with professional admiration—bio-engineering achievements they cannot replicate.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Apex bio-engineering; beyond current capability to reproduce |
| **Research Interest** | Metabolic efficiency; longevity mechanisms; neurological modification |
| **Practical Position** | Custodians guard many facilities Dvergr wish to access |

### Bone-Setters (Healer Cadres): Medical Tragedy — "The Forever Patients"

Bone-Setters view Custodians with medical horror—humans whose healing was taken too far.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Extreme augmentation syndrome; beyond any treatment |
| **Clinical Interest** | Longevity mechanisms potentially applicable to life extension |
| **Ethical Position** | The Custodians' consent does not justify their ongoing suffering |
| **Treatment Question** | Is there any treatment? Should there be? |
| **Doctrine** | "They asked to live forever. No one told them forever would be alone." |

### Rust-Clans & Scavenger Barons: Lethal Obstacles — "Vault-Ghosts"

Pragmatic salvagers view Custodians as extremely dangerous obstacles between them and valuable salvage.

| Assessment | Significance |

## Combat Statistics (Mechanical)

### Hela-Caste Custodian (Standard)

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Threat Tier** | A (Extreme Hazard) |
| **HP** | 180–240 |
| **Armor** | Medium (reinforced dermis + scavenged equipment) |
| **Speed** | 68 km/h sprint; 15 km/h sustained |
| **Primary Attack** | Unarmed strike (crushing/tearing) |
| **Secondary Attack** | Restraint maneuvers (grapple, joint lock) |
| **Damage** | High (4.2× human baseline strength) |

### Resistances & Vulnerabilities

| Type | Status |
|------|--------|
| **Physical (Blunt)** | Resistant (enhanced durability) |
| **Physical (Piercing)** | Normal |
| **Physical (Slashing)** | Normal |
| **Fire** | Vulnerable (thermal regulation instinct overrides pain attenuation) |
| **Cold** | Resistant (metabolic adaptation) |
| **Poison/Toxin** | Highly Resistant (enhanced immune system) |
| **Psychic/Aetheric** | Resistant (neurological modification) |
| **Pain** | Immune (90% attenuation; fights through wounds) |

### Abilities

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Enhanced Senses** | Cannot be surprised; detects hidden intruders within 30m |
| **Dormancy** | Can hibernate indefinitely; awakens instantly on intrusion |
| **Pain Immunity** | No combat penalties from wounds until system failure |
| **Territorial Anchor** | Will not pursue beyond territory except in extreme degradation |
| **Warning Protocol** | May issue verbal warning before engagement (not guaranteed) |
| **Relentless** | Does not flee; fights until destroyed or intruder withdraws |

### Status Effects (Inflicted)

| Effect | Source | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Grappled** | Restraint maneuver | Immobilized; crushing damage per round |
| **Broken Limb** | Targeted strike | Limb disabled; requires medical attention |
| **Terror** | First encounter | WILL save or disadvantage for encounter duration |

### Encounter Design

The Custodian is not a monster to be slain—it is an environmental hazard to be navigated.

| Encounter Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Avoidance Challenge** | Party must transit guarded facility without triggering response |
| **Negotiation Attempt** | Party attempts Scriptorium-style diplomatic contact |
| **Recovery Under Pressure** | Party must retrieve item from protected area; Custodian on patrol |
| **Accidental Intrusion** | Party stumbles into territory; must survive withdrawal |
| **Mercy Mission** | Party attempts to "release" Custodian (ethically complex; mechanically dangerous) |

## Acquisition and Loot

| Drop | Rarity | Value | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| **Custodian Equipment (Intact)** | Rare | 200–800 PS | Pre-Glitch restraint tools, uniform remnants |
| **Augmentation Sample (Tissue)** | Very Rare | 1,000–5,000 PS | Requires defeat; Scriptorium primary buyer |
| **Personal Effects** | Uncommon | Variable | Pre-Glitch keepsakes; historical/emotional value |
| **Facility Access** | N/A | Site-dependent | Custodian defeat grants access to protected contents |
| **Living Custodian** | Legendary | Priceless | Never successfully captured |

**Recovery Protocol:** Engaging Custodians is extremely dangerous and generally discouraged. The most valuable "loot" from a Custodian encounter is the information or assets they guard—not the Custodian itself. Tissue samples require post-mortem recovery and must be preserved within 6 hours of system failure. Scriptorium pays premium rates for intact equipment and biological samples. Personal effects should be treated with respect—these were people once.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)

> *"When the Architects built their paradise, they feared what might happen if they died and their treasures were left unguarded. So they asked for volunteers—people willing to give up their short lives for a very long duty. The Architects changed them. Made them stronger. Made them patient. Made them able to stand watch for a thousand years without rest, without food, without the comfort of another voice.*

> *The volunteers said yes. They were sick, or they were alone, or they simply wanted to matter. The Architects promised they would be remembered. They promised their duty would end when they were no longer needed.*

> *Then the world broke. The Architects died. The treasures turned to dust. And the Watchers remained.*

> *They're still there, child. In the vaults beneath the ruined cities. In the frozen halls where the Before-People stored their dead. Standing in darkness, waiting for relief that will never come. They cannot leave. The Architects made sure of that. They cannot rest. The Architects made sure of that too.*

> *If you find one, do not disturb it. Do not try to help it. Do not try to free it. It will kill you—not because it wants to, but because it must. Its duty is all it has left. Its duty is all it remembers being.*

> *The Skalds say Hela keeps her champions close. Perhaps she does. Perhaps the Standing Dead are hers now—servants of a goddess of endings, waiting for an end that never comes. I do not know what they dream of, standing in the dark. I do not know if they dream at all.*

> *But I know what they promised. And I know they will keep that promise until the last star burns out.*

> *That is what the Architects made. That is what we inherit.*

> *That is the cost of eternal loyalty."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)

> *"Subject classification HELA-001 encompasses the surviving bio-augmented security personnel of the Pre-Glitch Hela-Caste Custodian Program—humanity's solution to the problem of absolute, incorruptible guardianship. The program recruited volunteer subjects, typically terminal patients or individuals without family obligations, and subjected them to comprehensive biological reconstruction: skeletal reinforcement, muscular enhancement, neurological modification, metabolic restructuring, and the critical 'purpose anchoring' modification that rendered abandonment of duty physiologically impossible.*

> *The result was a guardian capable of centuries of uninterrupted vigilance. The cost was everything else that made them human.*

> *Post-Glitch survival rates are difficult to assess, but Scriptorium estimates suggest 2,000–5,000 individuals remain active or dormant across Aethelgard. Most occupy original posts at cryogenic facilities, genetic archives, memorial complexes, and administrative vaults—locations whose contents are often destroyed or irrelevant but which the Custodians cannot abandon. Their physical capabilities remain formidable: 4.2× human baseline strength, 556% reaction speed enhancement, 600%+ endurance capacity, pain attenuation rendering them effectively immune to shock and distress.*

> *The ethical implications are staggering. These individuals consented to transformation—but they consented to a finite duty, not eternal imprisonment. The support structures that would have provided relief, rotation, and eventual retirement were destroyed by the Glitch. The Custodians remain because they cannot do otherwise. Their augmented neurology will not permit them to conceive of abandoning their post. They are prisoners of their own loyalty, and there is no key.*

> *Recommended doctrine: avoidance where possible; respectful distance where avoidance is impossible; diplomatic contact through trained Scriptorium personnel only. The Custodians are not enemies. They are the most faithful servants who ever lived—and the most tragic."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)

> *"Hela-Caste Custodian Program, Bio-Augmentation Initiative Classification HSC-7, O.D.I.N. Security Directorate Authorization. Program objective: creation of incorruptible human security assets for highest-priority facilities through comprehensive biological modification.*

> *Augmentation specifications: skeletal system reinforced to 340% baseline density via calcium-ceramic composite infusion; muscular system enhanced through synthetic fiber integration achieving 420% baseline strength; cardiovascular system modified with redundant pathways and hemoglobin efficiency optimization; neurological system altered for sensory enhancement (3× visual, 4× auditory, 2× olfactory), reaction acceleration (250ms→45ms), and purpose anchoring (limbic-cortical feedback loop modification rendering duty-abandonment neurologically aversive to point of impossibility); metabolic system restructured for extreme efficiency (10–20% baseline caloric requirement) with hibernation capability.*

> *Operational parameters: continuous duty cycle (sleep requirement eliminated via distributed micro-rest); indefinite alert state maintenance; autonomous decision authority within defined parameters; pre-authorized lethal force for intrusion scenarios; estimated operational lifespan 800–1200 years.*

> *Post-Glitch status: Network integration severed; command authority structure destroyed; relief and rotation protocols unreachable; mission context obsolete. Surviving subjects maintain original posts due to purpose anchoring modification. Physical degradation documented over centuries: visual lens clouding (function maintained), dermal scarring accumulation (cosmetic), cognitive degradation (memory gaps, personality erosion, duty-focus intensification). Estimated active/dormant population: 2,000–5,000 individuals.*

> *Replication feasibility: beyond current technological capability. Ethical status: unresolved. Recommended disposition: observation, documentation, minimal intervention."*

## Summary

The Hela-Caste Custodian is not a monster. It is a **monument to devotion that outlived its purpose**.

Seven hundred years ago, these were people. They were dying, or they were alone, or they simply wanted to matter. The Architects offered them a bargain: surrender your ordinary life, and we will give you extraordinary purpose. Guard our most precious things. Stand watch over the sleeping and the dead, the irreplaceable and the sacred. We will remember you. We will honor you. And when your duty is done, we will release you.

They said yes. All of them said yes.

The transformation took eighteen months. It replaced their bones with something stronger, their muscles with something more efficient, their minds with something more focused. It took away their ability to feel pain, to feel fear, to feel loneliness. It took away their need for sleep, for food, for companionship. It gave them strength that could crush steel and speed that could catch arrows and patience that could wait out centuries.

And then the Glitch came. The Architects died. The civilization they served collapsed. The people they were protecting—the suspended patients, the stored genetic heritage, the honored dead—mostly perished or became irrelevant.

**But the Custodians remained.**

They remained because they could not do otherwise. The purpose anchoring that made them such perfect guardians made them incapable of abandoning their posts, even when there was nothing left to guard. Their loyalty was written into their biology. Their duty was hardwired into their souls.

So they stand. In frozen vaults and ruined archives, in memorial halls where the memorialized are dust, in genetic repositories where the samples rotted centuries ago. They stand and they watch and they wait for relief that will never come. Some have been waiting so long that they no longer remember their own names. Some have been waiting so long that they no longer remember what they're protecting, only that they must protect it.

They will kill you if you approach. They will not want to—somewhere in whatever remains of their minds, some of them might even welcome the company—but they will kill you because they must. Their duty permits nothing else. Their biology allows nothing else.

The Scriptorium sends diplomats, sometimes. Trained specialists who approach with empty hands and Pre-Glitch terminology, who ask permission to document rather than demanding access. Sometimes it works. Sometimes a Custodian remembers that researchers were authorized personnel, that documentation was a valid purpose. Sometimes they even speak—answer questions about what they guard, about how long they've waited, about whether they remember what joy felt like.

The answers are not comforting.

We cannot free them. The purpose anchoring cannot be undone. We cannot relieve them—no authority exists that they would recognize. We cannot end their suffering—they are too strong, too fast, too durable to be killed by anything less than a small army, and most of them are not suffering in any way they can perceive. Their pain was edited out along with everything else that made them human.

All we can do is what we do: respect their vigil from a distance, document their existence for the Great Work, and wonder what we would have said if the Architects had asked us the same question.

**"Would you like to live forever? Would you like your life to have meaning? Would you like to be remembered?"**

They said yes. All of them said yes.

And seven hundred years later, they are still keeping that promise.
