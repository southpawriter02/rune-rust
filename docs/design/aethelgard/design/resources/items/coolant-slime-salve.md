# Coolant-Slime Salve — Topical Psycho-Attenuator
## Codex Entry: CODX-A-CSSL-001

> *"The screaming started on the third day. Not from our throats—from inside our skulls. Jens clawed at his temples until they bled. Marta spoke in tongues none of us recognized. The Static was eating us alive, and we were two days from the nearest Bone-Setter. Then old Torvik pulled a tin from his pack—grey-green paste that smelled of machine oil and winter moss. 'Rub it on your temples,' he said. 'Behind your ears. Back of your neck.' Within an hour, the screaming faded to whispers. By morning, we could think again. Torvik called it 'Ghost-Balm.' Said the Dvergr trade it for good steel. I don't know what's in it, and I don't care. I know what it did. It gave us back our minds long enough to walk out of that place alive."*

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Thermal Regulator

### Original Purpose

The bio-gel that would become Coolant-Slime Salve was never intended for human application. It was a thermal regulation compound—a living lubricant secreted by engineered organisms within the Yggdrasil Network's cooling infrastructure.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Cryo-Stabilization Chambers** | Temperature regulation for sensitive computational arrays |
| **Deep-Core Heat Exchangers** | Thermal transfer medium in geothermal power systems |
| **Bio-Mechanical Interfaces** | Lubricant and coolant for organic-synthetic junctions |

### A Living Coolant

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Design Philosophy** | Self-regenerating thermal regulation via bio-engineered slime colonies |
| **Core Function** | Heat absorption, thermal equilibration, friction reduction |
| **Organism Type** | Colonial micro-fauna producing specialized secretions |
| **Energy Source** | Ambient thermal differential; thrived on temperature gradients |
| **Integration** | Maintained by Yggdrasil Network automated systems; colonies self-sustaining in controlled environments |

The Cryo-Stabilizer colonies were engineered by the Vanir Collective to solve a fundamental problem: how to cool vast computational arrays without mechanical failure points. The solution was elegance itself—living organisms that secreted a gel with extraordinary thermal absorption properties. The colonies lived in the spaces between, multiplying and secreting, maintaining perfect thermal equilibrium across kilometers of infrastructure.

### Core Systems

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Colonial Organism** | Micro-fauna reproducing via budding; lifespan 6–8 months per generation |
| **Secretion Glands** | Continuous bio-gel production; 0.5–2.0 liters per colony per day |
| **Thermal Receptors** | Environmental sensing; secretion rate increases with temperature differential |
| **Bio-Aetheric Membrane** | Gel composition includes trace Aetheric compounds for enhanced thermal transfer |
| **Self-Regulation** | Population control via resource availability; prevented overgrowth |

**The Cooling Cycle:**

| Process | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Detection** | Colony senses localized temperature increase |
| **Secretion** | Bio-gel production increases in affected zone |
| **Absorption** | Gel absorbs excess thermal energy via endothermic reaction |
| **Dissipation** | Heat transferred through gel matrix to cooler zones |
| **Equilibration** | Temperature normalized; secretion rate returns to baseline |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Vanir's Living Lubricant.** The Cryo-Stabilizer colonies were not conscious, not intelligent, not even particularly complex. They were biological machines designed to do one thing exceptionally well: keep things cold. The gel they produced was a byproduct of their existence—and for seven hundred years before the Glitch, no one considered that this byproduct might have applications beyond thermal regulation.

---

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Unexpected Discovery

The Glitch did not corrupt the Cryo-Stabilizer colonies—it freed them. Without the Yggdrasil Network's environmental controls, the carefully maintained temperature gradients that sustained them collapsed. Most colonies died. But some adapted.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Colonial Organism** | Partially intact; reduced populations in protected micro-environments |
| **Secretion Glands** | Functional; gel production continues at reduced rate |
| **Thermal Receptors** | Operational; sensitivity to temperature differential maintained |
| **Bio-Aetheric Membrane** | Altered; Blight absorption created unexpected properties |
| **Self-Regulation** | Disrupted; population boom-bust cycles in wild colonies |

### What Changed

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Network Integration** | Severed; colonies became feral, self-sustaining |
| **Environmental Control** | Lost; colonies migrated to natural thermal gradients |
| **Gel Composition** | Transformed; Blighted Aether absorption introduced psycho-active compounds |
| **Purpose** | Evolved; thermal regulation became secondary to survival |
| **Human Interaction** | Initiated; displaced colonies encountered by salvagers |

### The Accidental Medicine

The discovery of Coolant-Slime Salve's therapeutic properties was not the result of careful research—it was desperation.

| Pre-Glitch Application | Post-Glitch Discovery |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Applied to machinery for thermal regulation | Applied to skin for burn treatment |
| Used in computational cooling systems | Found to reduce fever |
| Maintained by automated systems | Harvested by Dvergr salvage teams |
| No human contact intended | Contact revealed unexpected neural effects |
| Pure thermal function | Psycho-active properties emerged |

**The First Application:**

> *"The Dvergr records are fragmentary, but consistent. Somewhere in the first century after the Glitch, a salvage team in the Niflheim Frost-Vents encountered a pool of the gel while suffering acute Static Sickness from prolonged Aetheric exposure. One worker, delirious and burning with fever, fell into the pool. When they pulled him out, he was coherent. The screaming in his head had stopped. They didn't understand why. They didn't need to. They just needed it to work."*

The Blighted Aether that the surviving colonies absorbed had fundamentally altered the gel's chemical composition. Where once it absorbed thermal energy, it now absorbed something else: the cascading bio-Aetheric resonance that manifests as Psychic Stress.

## Physical Characteristics

### Morphology

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Consistency** | Semi-viscous gel; texture between petroleum jelly and aloe vera |
| **Color** | Grey-green with faint luminescent striations (fresh); darkening to grey-brown with age |
| **Opacity** | Translucent when fresh; increasing opacity indicates degradation |
| **Odor** | Distinctive machine-oil base note with secondary moss/mineral tones |
| **Temperature** | Notably cool to touch (5–8°C below ambient); maintains temperature differential |
| **Mass (Standard Dose)** | 3–5g per application site |

### Visual Appearance

| State | Coloration | Luminosity | Indication |
|-------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Fresh (0–30 days)** | Grey-green, translucent | Faint bio-luminescent striations | Full potency |
| **Mature (30–90 days)** | Grey with green undertones | Reduced luminescence | 80–95% potency |
| **Aged (90–180 days)** | Grey-brown, increasing opacity | Minimal luminescence | 50–80% potency |
| **Degraded (>180 days)** | Brown-black, opaque | No luminescence | <50% potency; discard |

**Overall Impression:** The salve appears almost alive in fresh samples—the faint luminescent striations shift slowly, like watching aurora through frosted glass. The cool temperature persists even in warm environments, a remnant of its original thermal absorption function. When applied to skin, the gel spreads with unusual ease, seeming to seek contact with nerve clusters. The machine-oil scent, while not unpleasant, marks users clearly—experienced Bone-Setters can identify recent application by smell alone.

### Container Requirements

| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| **Material** | Sealed glass or ceramic; metal containers cause degradation |
| **Temperature** | Storage at 2–8°C optimal; room temperature acceptable for <30 days |
| **Light Exposure** | Dark storage required; direct sunlight destroys active compounds within 4 hours |
| **Seal Integrity** | Air exposure reduces potency 5% per day after seal breach |
| **Standard Units** | 15g tin (5 doses), 50g jar (16 doses), 200g Guild canister (66 doses) |

### Active Compound Profile

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Cryo-Stabilizer Base Gel** | Carrier medium; provides thermal absorption properties |
| **Bio-Aetheric Dampening Compound** | Primary psycho-active agent; attenuates Aetheric resonance |
| **Lipid Matrix** | Enables transdermal absorption; derived from original lubricant function |
| **Trace Minerals** | Niflheim-specific mineral content; contributes to shelf stability |
| **Residual Blight Signature** | Low-level; therapeutic in trace amounts, toxic in concentration |

## Mechanism of Action

### Pathology: The Psychic Stress Cascade

To understand how Coolant-Slime Salve works, one must first understand what it treats.

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Exposure** | Subject encounters elevated Aetheric field or Blight-contaminated environment |
| **2. Resonance** | Bio-Aetheric compounds in neural tissue begin sympathetic vibration |
| **3. Cascade** | Resonance amplifies; neural pathways conduct increasing Aetheric load |
| **4. Manifestation** | Psychic Stress symptoms emerge: auditory hallucinations, cognitive fragmentation, emotional dysregulation |
| **5. Degradation** | Without intervention, cascade becomes self-sustaining; Cognitive Paradox Syndrome onset |

### Attenuation Mechanism

| Phase | Process |
|-------|---------|
| **Application** | Salve applied to high-concentration neural access points (temples, mastoid, cervical spine) |
| **Absorption** | Lipid matrix enables rapid transdermal penetration (onset 8–15 minutes) |
| **Dampening Field** | Bio-Aetheric compound creates localized interference pattern |
| **Cascade Interruption** | Sympathetic resonance disrupted; neural Aetheric load begins dissipation |
| **Attenuation Window** | 4–6 hours of reduced Psychic Stress; natural recovery can proceed |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Critical Distinction:** The salve does not heal. It does not repair damaged neural pathways or remove accumulated Blight contamination. It creates a **window of reduced symptom intensity** during which the body's natural recovery processes can function—or during which the subject can reach professional care. Subjects who rely solely on repeated application without addressing underlying exposure will experience diminishing returns and eventual treatment resistance.

### Efficacy Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Onset Time** | 8–15 minutes (temples); 15–25 minutes (cervical application) |
| **Peak Efficacy** | 45–90 minutes post-application |
| **Duration** | 4–6 hours (standard); 2–4 hours (severe exposure) |
| **Symptom Reduction** | 78.4% average; range 45–95% depending on exposure severity |
| **Cumulative Tolerance** | Efficacy reduces 8–12% per consecutive day of use; 72-hour abstention restores baseline |

### Dosage Protocol

| Application Site | Mass | Coverage | Priority |
|------------------|------|----------|----------|
| **Temples (bilateral)** | 1.5g per side | 3cm diameter circular | Primary |
| **Mastoid Process (bilateral)** | 1.0g per side | 2cm diameter circular | Secondary |
| **Cervical Vertebrae (C1–C3)** | 2.0g | 4cm × 6cm rectangular | Tertiary |
| **Total Standard Dose** | 5.0g | — | — |

### Overdose Profile

| Threshold | Symptoms |
|-----------|----------|
| **>5 applications/24 hours** | Emotional blunting, reduced pain sensitivity, cognitive sluggishness |
| **>15g total mass/24 hours** | Hypothermic symptoms, bradycardia, dissociative episodes |
| **>25g total mass/24 hours** | Catatonic state risk; respiratory depression; requires immediate medical intervention |
| **Chronic Overuse (>14 days)** | Dependency formation; rebound Psychic Stress upon cessation; permanent efficacy reduction |

| **Physical Dependency Onset** | 14–21 days continuous use |
| **Psychological Dependency Onset** | 7–14 days continuous use |
| **Withdrawal Symptoms** | Rebound Psychic Stress (120–180% baseline), anxiety, insomnia, hyperacusis |
| **Withdrawal Duration** | 3–7 days acute; 14–28 days post-acute |
| **Recovery Protocol** | Gradual taper (25% reduction every 3 days) with Bone-Setter monitoring |

### Threat Level Justification

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Acute Toxicity** | Low (overdose requires 5x standard dose) |
| **Chronic Risk** | Moderate (dependency formation with extended use) |

## Field Protocols

### Detection and Verification

| Method | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Visual Inspection** | Luminescent striations indicate freshness; opacity indicates degradation |
| **Olfactory Test** | Machine-oil + moss scent; absence indicates counterfeit or severe degradation |
| **Temperature Test** | Should feel cool to touch; room-temperature product is degraded |
| **Spread Test** | Fresh salve spreads easily; gritty texture indicates contamination |
| **Luminescence Test** | Rub small amount; faint glow should be visible in darkness (fresh product) |

### Field Card: Coolant-Slime Salve Application Protocol

| Phase | Protocol |
|-------|----------|
| **BEFORE (Assessment)** | Confirm Psychic Stress symptoms (auditory disturbance, cognitive fragmentation, emotional dysregulation); verify no contraindications (hemorrhage, hypothermia, concurrent stimulants); check product freshness (luminescence, temperature, odor); calculate exposure severity for dosage adjustment |
| **DURING (Application)** | Clean application sites (temples, mastoid, cervical spine) if possible; apply 1.5g per temple in circular motion; apply 1.0g per mastoid process; apply 2.0g to cervical vertebrae (C1–C3); massage gently until absorbed (30–60 seconds per site); note application time for duration tracking |
| **DURING (Monitoring)** | Onset expected 8–15 minutes; peak efficacy 45–90 minutes; monitor for paradoxical reaction (symptom intensification rather than reduction); if no improvement by 30 minutes, do not re-apply—seek Bone-Setter evaluation; monitor for overdose symptoms if multiple applications required |
| **AFTER (Documentation)** | Log application time, dosage, symptom severity pre/post; track cumulative applications over 24-hour period; do not exceed 3 applications per cycle; plan for professional evaluation if symptoms persist beyond single application; enforce 72-hour abstention after 7+ consecutive days of use |

**OUTCOME:** Subject reports 70–80% reduction in Psychic Stress symptoms within 45 minutes. Cognitive function restored to operational baseline. Subject ambulatory and capable of reaching professional care or completing mission-critical tasks.

| **No Response After 30 Minutes** | Underlying condition beyond salve's therapeutic range; professional intervention required |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Ingestion** | Gastrointestinal toxicity; severe cramping and hypothermic shock |
| **Ocular Application** | Corneal damage; permanent vision impairment |
| **Open Wound Application** | Systemic absorption at toxic levels; hypothermic shock risk |
| **Combination with Alcohol** | Potentiates sedative effects; respiratory depression risk |
| **Use as Fever Treatment** | Masks infection symptoms; delays appropriate treatment |
| **Recreational Emotional Blunting** | Accelerates dependency formation; depletes limited supply |

### Doctrine: Window of Mercy

> **Historical Validation:** Scriptorium data (847 documented applications, 23 independent field teams, 36-month observation period) confirms 78.4% average symptom reduction with proper protocol adherence. The Coolant-Slime Salve does not cure what ails us—it gives us time. Time to walk out of the places that break our minds. Time to reach those who can truly heal. Time to say goodbye if healing is beyond us. **The salve buys hours. What we do with those hours determines whether we live or die.**

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)

> *"In the old days, before the world broke, the gods kept their machines cold with living frost—tiny creatures that wept ice to soothe the burning hearts of their metal servants. When the gods died and their machines fell silent, most of those creatures died too. But some survived, hidden in the cold dark places, weeping still. The Dvergr found them. The Dvergr always find what hides in the dark. And they learned that the tears of these forgotten creatures could quiet the screaming in a person's head—the screaming that comes when you walk too long in the places the gods abandoned. We call it Ghost-Balm now. We don't know why it works. We just know that when the Static gets inside your skull and won't stop howling, you rub this cold grey paste on your temples and the howling fades. It doesn't stop. It never stops, not really. But it fades enough that you can think. Enough that you can walk. Enough that you can find your way home. The Ghost-Balm doesn't save you, child. It just gives you time. What you do with that time is up to you."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)

> *"Subject compound CSSL-001 represents an accidental pharmacological discovery—bio-gel produced by feral Cryo-Stabilizer colonies exhibiting unexpected psycho-active properties following Ginnungagap Glitch environmental contamination. The mechanism of action centers on the gel's bio-Aetheric dampening properties: when applied to high-concentration neural access points (temples, mastoid process, cervical vertebrae), the compound creates localized interference patterns that disrupt the sympathetic resonance cascade characteristic of Psychic Stress progression.*

> *Field efficacy is well-documented: 78.4% average symptom reduction across 847 applications in controlled observation. Onset time 8–15 minutes; peak efficacy 45–90 minutes; duration 4–6 hours. The compound does not repair neural damage or remove accumulated Blight contamination—it provides a suppression window during which natural recovery processes can function or professional intervention can be sought.*

> *Critical concerns: dependency formation with chronic use (onset 14–21 days); cumulative tolerance requiring escalating dosages; rebound Psychic Stress upon cessation in dependent users. Protocol adherence essential: maximum 3 applications per 24-hour cycle; 72-hour abstention recommended after 7+ consecutive days of use. The compound is a tool, not a cure. It buys time. That is all it does. That is enough."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)

> *"Thermal Regulation Bio-Gel (Cryo-Stabilizer Byproduct), Vanir Bio-Asset Classification. Original deployment: infrastructure thermal regulation within Yggdrasil Network cooling systems. Core composition: lipid-based carrier matrix, bio-Aetheric trace compounds (post-Glitch contamination), mineral suspension from substrate interaction.*

> *Post-Glitch adaptation: Blight absorption during environmental collapse introduced novel psycho-active compounds into gel matrix. Bio-Aetheric dampening coefficient measured at 0.73 ± 0.08 (standardized assay). Transdermal absorption rate: 85–92% of active compounds within 15 minutes of application to prepared skin.*

> *Mechanism: localized bio-Aetheric interference pattern generation. Neural tissue Aetheric resonance disrupted via destructive wave interaction. Cascade propagation halted; accumulated Aetheric load dissipates at natural rate (estimated 0.8–1.2 levels per hour in absence of continued exposure).*

> *Production: wild harvest from Niflheim Frost-Vent colonies (primary); Jötunheim infrastructure remnant colonies (secondary); Dvergr Under-Guild domesticated cultivation (commercial). Quality variation: wild harvest 60–95% potency; cultivated 90–100% potency. Shelf stability: 180 days sealed at 2–8°C; 30 days room temperature; 72 hours post-seal breach.*

> *Therapeutic index: LD50 approximately 75g/kg body weight (acute oral); effective dose 5g topical. Safety margin adequate for field use with protocol adherence."*

## Summary

The Coolant-Slime Salve is not medicine. It is **borrowed time**.

The Vanir created the Cryo-Stabilizer colonies to solve an engineering problem—how to keep vast computational arrays cool without mechanical failure. The colonies lived in the spaces between, secreting gel that absorbed heat with elegant efficiency. They were not important. They were not even interesting. They were simply part of the infrastructure, as unremarkable as pipes or wires.

Then the Glitch shattered everything. The temperature gradients collapsed. The colonies died—most of them. But some survived, hidden in the cold places, absorbing the Blighted Aether that saturated their environment. And the gel they secreted changed.

No one planned this. No Vanir engineer anticipated that their living lubricant would become the most effective treatment for Psychic Stress in the post-Glitch world. No Dvergr salvager expected to find medicine in the ruins of cooling systems. No Alchemist Guild researcher set out to discover that a grey-green paste could quiet the screaming inside a person's skull.

**It simply happened. The world broke, and in the breaking, something useful emerged.**

The salve does not cure what ails us. It does not repair the damage that the Static does to our minds. It does not remove the contamination that accumulates when we walk too long in the places the gods abandoned. It simply... quiets things. For a few hours. Long enough to think. Long enough to walk. Long enough to reach someone who can truly help—or long enough to say goodbye if help is beyond us.

The Dvergr call it Frost-Gel and trade it for good steel. The Alchemist Guild calls it Cognitive Damper Compound and regulates its distribution. The Bone-Setters call it The First Mercy and carry it in every field kit. The common folk call it Ghost-Balm and pray they never need it.

The Scriptorium has a simpler name: **The Window.**

Because that is what it gives us. A window. A few hours of clarity in the howling chaos of a broken world. What we do with those hours—whether we use them to escape, to heal, to fight, or simply to make peace—that is up to us.

The salve buys time.

**What you do with that time is up to you.**
