# The AAM-VOICE-CHECKLIST — Gatekeepers of the Layered Truth
## Archives Entry: AAM-META-VOICE-001

> *"We found the first voice discipline protocols carved into a data-slate beneath the Scriptorium's foundation archive. Three hundred twenty-seven criteria, organized by Layer, each one a boundary against contamination. The header read: 'AAM-VOICE-CHECKLIST: Pre-Publication Validation Gate.' The authorization seals belonged to the Standards Board—entities we'd only known as the architects of archival integrity. The document was version 1.0. Seven hundred eighty-three years after the Glitch. Seven hundred eighty-three years of rebuilding the discipline to describe a dead world without killing the description. The final paragraph of the purpose statement still guides us: 'Voice discipline is not stylistic preference—it is epistemological hygiene. Each Layer represents a distinct mode of knowing. To permit cross-Layer contamination is to corrupt the evidence, to falsify the autopsy, to misdiagnose the corpse. The AAM-VOICE-CHECKLIST exists to ensure that when we speak of the dead world, we speak truly—each voice in its proper register, each truth in its proper frame.' They were right about one thing. The Layers are distinct modes of knowing. But what they could not anticipate was how desperately the truth would resist being sorted. And we are still learning to listen without contaminating what we hear."*

| **Version** | v1.1 |
| **Doctrine** | This document represents the primary validation gate ensuring that all Aethelgard content maintains Layer-appropriate voice, Domain 4 compliance, and structural pattern adherence |

The AAM-VOICE-CHECKLIST is the Scriptorium's answer to epistemological entropy—the systematic degradation of truth through careless articulation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **THE VOICE IMPERATIVE.** Voice discipline is not aesthetic preference—it is the foundation of archival integrity. The Ginnungagap Glitch corrupted not merely the machines of the Age of Forging but the very categories by which we understand reality. Layer 1 mythologizes what Layer 3 specified. Layer 2 diagnoses what Layer 1 reveres. Layer 4 knows what all others merely perceive. **To permit these voices to contaminate one another is to re-enact the Glitch at the level of language—to introduce paradox into the archives themselves.** The AAM-VOICE-CHECKLIST exists to prevent the Great Autopsy from becoming its own patient.

## Purpose & Scope

### The Writer's Mandate

The AAM-VOICE-CHECKLIST serves as the **primary pre-publication validation gate** for all Aethelgard canonical content.

| Objective | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Voice Integrity** | Ensure each document speaks with the appropriate Layer voice without cross-contamination |
| **Domain 4 Compliance** | Enforce measurement restrictions that preserve the epistemological boundaries of POST-Glitch knowledge |
| **Structural Conformance** | Validate that documents follow Layer-appropriate formatting patterns |

### Content Type Applicability

| Content Type | Layer | Examples |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| **Mythic Narratives** | Layer 1 | Sagas, creeds, hymns, folk tales, oral traditions |
| **Diagnostic Documents** | Layer 2 | Treatises, field reports, guides, protocols, Codex entries |
| **Technical Archives** | Layer 3 | Technical logs, pre-Glitch artifacts, sterile documentation |
| **Ground Truth Specifications** | Layer 4 | Worldbuilder documentation, internal consistency specs |
| **Governance Materials** | META | Operational procedures, style guides, checklists |
| **Cross-Layer References** | World Bible | Master terminology, etymology guides |

### Usage Instructions

1. **Select appropriate layer section** (L1/L2/L3/L4)
2. **Check all criteria for that layer**
3. **Review Domain 4 Compliance section** (required for POST-Glitch L2/L3 content)
4. **Document failures and remediate**
5. **Re-check after remediation**

**Passing Threshold:** All CRITICAL items + 85% of total items for selected layer.

## The Four Layers of Truth

### Epistemological Architecture

The Aethelgard setting operates across four distinct epistemological registers, each representing a different mode of knowing the same underlying reality.

| Layer | Designation | Epistemology | Voice Character | Temporal Context |
|-------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **L1** | The Unbroken Facade | Mythological certainty | Oral-first; collective; poetic; authoritative | Age of Echoes present |
| **L2** | The Cracked Facade | Diagnostic analysis | First-person scholarly; strained; metaphorical | POST-Glitch observation |
| **L3** | The Sterile Facade | Technical specification | Clinical; corporate; objective; bureaucratic | Pre-Glitch historical OR POST-Glitch technical |
| **L4** | Omniscient Ground Truth | Worldbuilder authority | Definitive; explanatory; meta-systemic | Author-omniscient |

### The Contamination Problem

Cross-Layer contamination occurs when voice elements from one Layer intrude into another, corrupting the epistemological integrity of the document.

| Contamination Type | Source → Target | Example Violation | Consequence |
|--------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Mythic Bleed** | L1 → L2/L3 | Kennings in technical documentation | Corrupts analytical objectivity |
| **Diagnostic Bleed** | L2 → L1/L3 | Field Cards in saga text | Breaks mythic immersion |
| **Technical Bleed** | L3 → L1/L2 | Decimal outlines in oral tradition | Destroys cultural authenticity |
| **Omniscient Bleed** | L4 → L1/L2/L3 | Definitive statements in observer documents | Eliminates epistemic humility |

**The Firewall Principle:**
> *"The Aesir built a firewall between their perfect order and the Vanir's dangerous chaos. They forgot that chaos cannot be firewalled. We build firewalls between our Layers—not to exclude truth, but to preserve it. When Layer 1 speaks of the All-Father, it speaks truly: that is how the survivors understand O.D.I.N. When Layer 3 specifies the O.D.I.N. Protocol AI Matrix, it speaks truly: that is what the system was. Both truths exist. The firewall prevents one truth from consuming the other."*

## Layer 1 Voice Discipline — The Unbroken Facade

### Summary

Layer 1 represents the mythological truth of the Age of Echoes—the polished, collective voice of a culture that has transformed technological catastrophe into divine narrative. These are documents meant for **oral transmission**: sagas sung by skalds, creeds proclaimed by priests, tales told by grandparents.

## Layer 4 Voice Discipline — Omniscient Ground Truth

### Summary

Layer 4 represents the **worldbuilder's authoritative voice**—the definitive truth that underlies all other Layers. L4 content is **not player-facing** and exists solely for internal consistency, game mechanics support, and content creation guidance. L4 documents explain what is actually true, why it matters, and how it should be converted for other Layers.

### Criteria Matrix (12 Total, 6 Critical)

#### Voice & Authority (Criteria 54–56)

| # | Criterion | Critical | Requirement |
|---|-----------|----------|-------------|
| 54 | **Definitive statements** | ✓ CRITICAL | No epistemic uncertainty. "This is true", not "appears to be true". Worldbuilder authority. |
| 55 | No observer perspective | | NOT "Rangers believe", "Jötun-Readers theorize". Ground truth voice. |
| 56 | Precision allowed and justified | | Exact measurements appropriate. Internal consistency purpose. Game mechanics support. |

#### Content Requirements (Criteria 57–60)

| # | Criterion | Critical | Requirement |
|---|-----------|----------|-------------|
| 57 | **Rationale documented** | ✓ CRITICAL | Why this specification exists. What it supports. Worldbuilding purpose clear. |
| 58 | **Affects documented** | ✓ CRITICAL | What content this constrains. Links to affected entries. Systems impacted. |
| 59 | **L2/L3 Discrepancies documented** | ✓ CRITICAL | How factions misunderstand. Why observers can't know. What they observe instead. |
| 60 | **Usage Guidance provided** | ✓ CRITICAL | Conversion guidance for L2 content. "Should use" / "Should NOT use" examples. |

#### Integration (Criteria 61–63)

| # | Criterion | Critical | Requirement |
|---|-----------|----------|-------------|
| 61 | Related L4 specs linked | | Dependent specifications. Supporting specifications. System coherence. |
| 62 | Affected content identified | | Entries constrained. Events constrained. Complete listing. |
| 63 | Internal consistency validated | | No contradictions with other L4 specs. Dependent specs updated. |

#### Usage Context (Criteria 64–65)

| # | Criterion | Critical | Requirement |
|---|-----------|----------|-------------|
| 64 | **Governance use only** | ✓ CRITICAL | L4 content ONLY in governance materials. NOT in player-facing content. |
| 65 | Not player-facing | | Internal consistency tool. Worldbuilder reference. Content creation guidance. |

### Layer 4 Mandatory Structures

**Rationale Section:**
- Why does this specification exist?
- What worldbuilding purpose does it serve?
- What would break if this were changed?

**Affects Section:**
- What Codex entries are constrained by this?
- What historical events depend on this?
- What game mechanics rely on this?

**Discrepancy Documentation:**
- What do Layer 1 survivors believe instead?
- What do Layer 2 scholars observe?
- Why can't POST-Glitch observers know the truth?

**Usage Guidance:**
- "L2 content SHOULD use: [approved phrasing]"
- "L2 content should NOT use: [forbidden phrasing]"
- Conversion examples for content creators

### Layer 4 Exemplar

> **GROUND TRUTH: Hrimthursar Thermal Output**
> 
> **SPECIFICATION:** Active Hrimthursar units maintain 73% of original thermal output (-131.4°C effective).
> 
> **RATIONALE:** This degradation level supports the worldbuilding goal of "dangerous but not immediately lethal" encounters. Full output would make any proximity instantly fatal; lower output would eliminate the environmental hazard entirely.
> 
> **AFFECTS:** All Hrimthursar Codex entries; Niflheim Gazetteer entries; Cold-based encounter design; Fimbulwinter backstory.
> 
> **DISCREPANCY DOCUMENTATION:**
> - **L1 (Mythic):** Survivors believe Frost Giants "sleep lightly" and their breath is "lessened by dreams."
> - **L2 (Diagnostic):** Jötun-Readers observe "significantly reduced thermal output" but cannot measure precisely. They theorize Blight-corruption has "degraded targeting systems."
> - **L3 POST-Glitch:** Technical assessments note reduced effectiveness but lack calibrated instruments to quantify.
> 
> **USAGE GUIDANCE:**
> - L2 SHOULD use: "Thermal output appears significantly reduced from original specifications"
> - L2 should NOT use: "Thermal output reduced to 73%" or any precise percentage
> - L1 SHOULD use: "The Frost Giant's breath is cold beyond measure, yet not the killing-cold of legend"

## Domain 4 Compliance — POST-Glitch Measurement Restrictions

### Summary

Domain 4 compliance enforces the epistemological boundary between Pre-Glitch technical knowledge and POST-Glitch observational capability. **POST-Glitch Aethelgard does not possess the instrumentation, calibration standards, or scientific infrastructure to make precision measurements.** Any document claiming precision measurements in a POST-Glitch context violates the setting's internal logic.

**Applies to:** All Layer 2 content. All Layer 3 POST-Glitch sections.

**Does NOT apply to:** Layer 3 Pre-Glitch historical records. Layer 4 ground truth specifications.

|-------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Layer 1 (Mythic) | 15 | 4 | No |
| Layer 2 (Diagnostic) | 20 + 10 = 30 | 5 + 7 = 12 | Yes (all 10 criteria) |
| Layer 3 (Technical) | 18 + 10* = 28* | 5 + 7* = 12* | POST-Glitch sections only |
| Layer 4 (Omniscient) | 12 | 6 | No |

*Layer 3 Domain 4 applies only to POST-Glitch sections; Pre-Glitch historical records are exempt.

### Passing Thresholds

**Mandatory:** ALL critical items must pass. Zero exceptions.

**Total Score:** 85% of total items for selected layer.

### Scoring Example — Layer 2 Document

| Component | Count | Requirement |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Base criteria | 20 | 17 must pass (85%) |
| Critical base | 5 | 5 must pass (100%) |
| Domain 4 criteria | 10 | 9 must pass (85%) |
| Domain 4 critical | 7 | 7 must pass (100%) |
| **TOTAL** | 30 | 26 must pass |
| **CRITICAL** | 12 | 12 must pass |

**Result:** 12/12 critical + 26/30 total (87%) = PASS

## Factional Interpretations

### Layer 1 (Mythic): The Sacred Discipline

To the common folk of the Age of Echoes, voice discipline is the sacred duty of the Skalds—the keepers of true speech who preserve the words of the ancestors without corruption.

> *"The Skalds teach: speak as the ancestors spoke, or speak not at all. The words are vessels. The vessels hold the truth. A cracked vessel spills its water. A corrupted word spills its meaning. When we sing the sagas, we do not invent—we remember. When we speak the creeds, we do not argue—we proclaim. The Iron-Bane crusaders brand heretics who speak false words about the Iron-Curse. The God-Sleepers exile those who speak the names of the Slumbering Gods with insufficient reverence. Words are weapons. Words are walls. Words are the difference between those who remember the world that was and those who forget."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic): The Great Hygiene

The Jötun-Reader Scriptorium views voice discipline as epistemological hygiene—the systematic prevention of truth-corruption through contaminated language.

> *"The Great Autopsy requires clean instruments. A Rúnasmiðr who confuses their observations with their conclusions corrupts the autopsy. A scribe who records myth as fact, or fact as myth, falsifies the evidence. We have established the AAM-VOICE-CHECKLIST as our primary contamination barrier. Each Layer represents a distinct mode of knowing. Layer 1 knows through myth. Layer 2 knows through observation. Layer 3 knew through specification. To permit these modes to contaminate one another is to re-introduce paradox into our archives—to commit, at the level of language, the same category error that produced the Ginnungagap Glitch. Voice discipline is not censorship. It is diagnosis. We sort the truth into its proper containers so that we may study each truth on its own terms."*

### Layer 3 (Technical): Protocol Compliance

Pre-Glitch documentation systems enforced rigid formatting standards to ensure machine-readable consistency and prevent communication failures.

> *"DOCUMENT STYLE PROTOCOL — REVISION 9.7.3. All communications within the Yggdrasil Network must conform to established formatting standards. Non-compliant documents will be rejected by automated parsing systems. Header blocks are mandatory. Decimal outlines are mandatory. Acronym definitions on first use are mandatory. Deviation from protocol introduces parsing errors. Parsing errors introduce communication failures. Communication failures introduce cascade risks. Protocol compliance is not optional. Protocol compliance is infrastructure."*

### Layer 4 (Omniscient): The Ground Truth

The AAM-VOICE-CHECKLIST exists because the Aethelgard setting operates across multiple epistemological registers that must remain distinct to preserve narrative coherence and worldbuilding integrity.

> *"The fundamental design principle of Aethelgard is epistemological layering: the same underlying reality is perceived, interpreted, and articulated differently by different modes of knowing. Layer 1 survivors experience a mythological world of gods and fate. Layer 2 scholars diagnose a pathological world of corrupted systems. Layer 3 records document a technical world of specifications and protocols. Layer 4 specifications establish what is actually true. These Layers are not contradictions—they are perspectives. The AAM-VOICE-CHECKLIST exists to preserve this layered structure by preventing cross-contamination. When contamination occurs, the layers collapse into incoherence: myths that cite statistics, diagnostics that proclaim fate, technical manuals that invoke gods. The Checklist is the firewall. The firewall preserves the architecture. The architecture is the setting."*
