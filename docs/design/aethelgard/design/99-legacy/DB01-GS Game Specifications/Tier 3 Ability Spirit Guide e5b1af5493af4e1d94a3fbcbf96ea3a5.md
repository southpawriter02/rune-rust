## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Spirit Guide is the Seiðkona's **summoning ability**—the power to call forth a benevolent Forlorn as a temporary ally. Unlike the God-Sleeper Cultist's constructs, Spirit Guides are intelligent supporters who provide buffs and healing rather than raw damage.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Summon supportive spirit ally
- **Secondary:** Provide healing and defensive buffs to party
- **Self-Cost:** Moderate Psychic Stress (binding spirits is taxing)
- **Fantasy Delivery:** Calling a friendly dead to serve as guardian

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High (additional action economy + support)
- **Support Focus:** Spirit provides utility, not damage
- **Duration:** 5 rounds is substantial
- **Psychic Cost:** Prevents casual summoning

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Seiðkona speaks a name—not aloud, but in their heart. A name they learned from the echoes, a name belonging to one of the friendly dead who has chosen to walk with them. The veil between worlds grows thin, and a figure steps through.

The Spirit Guide is not a monster or a weapon. It is a **companion**—a benevolent Forlorn who remembers what it was to care for the living and chooses to help one last time. It hovers near the Seiðkona, pale and luminous, radiating an aura of peace and protection.

When the spirit fades, it does not die. It simply returns to the other side, waiting to be called again.

### Thematic Resonance

Spirit Guide is the Seiðkona's relationship with the dead made manifest—proof that communion with the Forlorn can be mutually beneficial, that the dead can still serve the living out of choice rather than compulsion.
