## Core Identity

Your senses are honed to detect the Blight's influence in the corrupted wilds. You read unnatural signs others miss: **the way moss grows away from a creature's path, the faint static hum of corrupted flesh, the subtle wrongness in a beast's gait**. You distinguish Blighted spoor from healthy tracks.

## Mechanics

### Always Active (Passive)

- **+1d10 bonus die** to all WITS-based checks for:
    - Tracking creatures (especially Blighted beasts)
    - Foraging in wilderness environments
    - Perceiving hidden or ambushing creatures
- **Corruption Identification:** Can visually assess corruption severity in creatures you observe (Low/Medium/High/Extreme)

### Rank Progression

| Rank | PP Cost | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2 | +1d10 WITS checks, identify Blighted by spoor |
| 2 | 20 | +2d10, estimate corruption level |
| 3 | Capstone | +3d10, auto-detect [Blighted] items without touching |

## Tactical Applications

**Corruption Scouting:**

- Assess enemy corruption before engagement
- Identify which targets are most vulnerable to Exploit Corruption
- Avoid accidentally looting contaminated items (Rank 3)

**Synergies:**

- **Mark for Death:** Scout corruption levels, then mark highest-Corruption target
- **Exploit Corruption:** Know which enemies give biggest crit bonuses
- **Blight-Tipped Arrow:** Better targeting for [Glitch] procs
