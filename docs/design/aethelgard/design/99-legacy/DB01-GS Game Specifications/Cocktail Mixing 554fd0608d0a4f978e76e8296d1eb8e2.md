## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Ability Type** | Passive |
| **Tier** | 2 (Advanced) |
| **PP Cost** | 4 / 4 / 4 |
| **Prerequisite** | 8 PP invested in Alka-hestur tree |

## Thematic Description

> *"Why use one reagent when two creates something new? Your combination formulas produce effects no single cartridge can match."*
> 

Cocktail Mixing unlocks the Alka-hestur's **advanced chemistry**—the ability to combine multiple payload types into unified cartridges that deliver multiple effects simultaneously.

---

## Mechanical Implementation

### Base Effect (Rank 1)

- Can combine **2 payload types** into a single **Cocktail Payload**
- Cocktail applies **both effects** when delivered
- Consumes **both payload charges** on use

### Rank 2

- Cocktails deal **+2d8 bonus damage** from chemical reaction
- **PP Cost**: 4

### Rank 3

- Can create **Triple Cocktails** (3 payloads combined)
- **Synergy Effects**: Certain combinations produce unique enhanced effects
- **PP Cost**: 4

## Cocktail Combinations

### Standard Dual Cocktails

| Combination | Effects Applied |
| --- | --- |
| Ignition + Acidic | [Burning] + [Corroded] |
| Cryo + Concussive | [Slowed] + [Staggered] |
| EMP + Acidic | [System Shock] + [Corroded] |
| Ignition + Cryo | [Burning] + [Slowed] (thermal shock) |

### Rank 3: Synergy Effects

| Combination | Synergy Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Fire + Acid** | [Melting]: Double armor reduction (-6 Soak) |
| **Cryo + EMP** | [Brittle System]: +50% damage from Physical |
| **Fire + Concussive** | [Incendiary Blast]: AoE spreads to adjacent |

---

## Resource Cost

| Cocktail Type | Payload Cost | Effects |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dual Cocktail | 2 charges | 2 effects |
| Triple Cocktail (R3) | 3 charges | 3 effects + synergy |

---

## Synergies

### Internal (Alka-hestur Tree)

- **Rack Expansion**: More capacity enables carrying cocktail components
- **Payload Strike**: Delivers cocktails like normal payloads
- **Area Saturation**: Rank 3 can use cocktails for AoE multi-effect
- **Volatile Synthesis**: Rank 3 can create cocktails via field synthesis

### External (Party Composition)

- **Debuff stacking**: Multiple status effects overwhelm targets
- **Damage + Control**: Fire damage while slowing
- **Armor shred + follow-up**: [Corroded] + party damage

---

## Tactical Applications

### Cocktail Selection

**Against High-Armor Mechanical**:

- EMP + Acidic = [System Shock] + [Corroded]
- Disables AND strips armor

**Against Fast Organic**:

- Ignition + Cryo = [Burning] + [Slowed]
- DoT while preventing escape

**Against Caster Boss (Rank 3)**:

- Fire + Acid + Concussive = [Melting] + [Staggered]
- Massive debuff stack

## v5.0 Compliance Notes

✅ **Technology, Not Magic**: Advanced chemistry, not spellcasting

✅ **Resource Trade-off**: More effects cost more charges

✅ **Synergy Design**: Rank 3 combinations create unique effects

✅ **Layer 2 Voice**: Reagent combination terminology
