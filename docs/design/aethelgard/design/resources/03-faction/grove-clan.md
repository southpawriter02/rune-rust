# The Grove-Clans — Gardeners of a Verdant Hell

> *"The Skalds of the Combine tell tales of us as wild folk, savage elves who live in the high trees and practice strange, unknowable rites. They are not entirely wrong. But they do not understand. We are not savages. We are the last, grieving gardeners of a paradise that has become a hell—the desperate curators of a living library whose every book has been twisted into a monster."*
> — Warden-Elder Kaelen Darkroot, Settlement Greenspire

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Classification** | Survivor Population (Vanir Descendants) |
| **Common Names** | The Grieving Gardeners, Children of the First Garden, Light Elves (Midgard folk tales) |
| **Core Philosophy** | Symbiosis Over Exploitation; Life as Garden, Not Machine |
| **Primary Territory** | Vanaheim Canopy Sea (40–100m elevation platforms) |
| **Leadership Structure** | Druidic Council (dual Ljósálfar/baseline Elder representation) |
| **Relationship to Blight** | Contain, mourn, release |

The Grove-Clans are the descendants of the Vanir Collective—master bio-engineers who designed Vanaheim's Genesis Engine ecosystem—now living as isolated survivors in the Canopy Sea, kilometers above the toxic Under-growth that claimed their kin. They are not a faction forged in conquest or ideology.

They are a people defined by a wound they cannot heal and a home they cannot leave.

They are gardeners tending the canopy of a cancerous tree, and they spend their lives listening to the screams of their ancestors rising from the roots.

---

## Core Identity: The Grieving Gardeners

### A Two-Caste Civilization

| Caste | Population | Role |
|-------|------------|------|
| **Baseline Grove-Clans** | 8,000–12,000 (75–80%) | Practical backbone: cultivation, crafting, defense, administration |
| **Ljósálfar (The Aether-Sown)** | 800–1,200 (20–25%) | Spiritual leadership: bio-theurgy, Mother Tree communion, long-term planning |

The Grove-Clans maintain a unique integrated society where two distinct populations collaborate in balanced governance. Baseline humans form the numerical majority and handle the practical necessities of survival. The Ljósálfar—post-human descendants of elite geneticists who have evolved through generations of symbiosis with pure Aetheric flora—serve as spiritual guides and healers.

This is not hierarchy.

This is symbiosis.

### The Philosophy of the Garden

| Vanir Principle | Grove-Clan Practice |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| "Life is garden to cultivate, not machine to command." | Living architecture grown from the trees themselves |
| "Guide life to its fullest potential." | Bio-theurgy healing rather than mechanical intervention |
| "Symbiosis over exploitation." | Heartwood sap harvest limited to 0.3% of Mother Tree volume |
| "The whole is sacred." | Harming a Mother Tree is the gravest of all crimes |

> *"The Aesir saw the universe as a machine to be commanded. Our ancestors saw it as a garden to be cultivated. We have inherited their wisdom—and their failures. We tend what remains, we mourn what was lost, and we guard against repeating the sins that broke the world."*

---

## Origins: The Gene-Storm Catastrophe

### The Vanir Collective Heritage

| Era | Status |
|-----|--------|
| **Age of Forging** | Master bio-engineers operating Vanaheim Genesis Engine |
| **Philosophy** | "Life as garden"—symbiosis with created ecosystems |
| **Achievement** | Mother Trees as permanent living infrastructure |
| **Catastrophe** | Gene-Storm mutagen release during the Ginnungagap Glitch |

The ancestors of the Grove-Clans were the Vanir, the master bio-engineers of the Age of Forging. Where the Aesir built machines of cold logic and rigid command, the Vanir cultivated living systems—guiding growth rather than imposing order. Vanaheim was their laboratory and their cathedral, a place where they lived within their own magnificent, dangerous creations.

### The Great Schism: Ascent vs. Fall

| Those Who Fled Upward | Those Trapped Below |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Found sanctuary in Canopy Sea | Caught in full Gene-Storm fury |
| Became Grove-Clans and Ljósálfar | Became the Unraveled |
| Carry 300+ years of survivor's guilt | Trapped in eternal biological nightmare |
| Live in sorrow and isolation | Exist as "Lost Kin"—sick children, not monsters |

During the Ginnungagap Glitch, a catastrophic Gene-Storm ravaged Vanaheim. A small number of Vanir, forewarned by failing systems, made a desperate flight upward into the high canopies of the colossal Mother Trees. They found sanctuary kilometers above the chaos, in the interlocking boughs that formed the Canopy Sea.

Those who were not swift enough—those trapped on the forest floor—suffered a fate far worse than death.

They were caught in the full, agonizing fury of the Gene-Storm, their bodies and minds shattered and rewritten by paradoxical mutagens.

They became the **Unraveled**.

This schism is the foundational trauma and the deepest sorrow of the Grove-Clan people.

### The Unraveled — Lost Kin Below

| Surface Perception | Grove-Clan Truth |
|--------------------|------------------|
| "Monsters to be hunted" | "Lost Kin—our own ancestors trapped in eternal suffering" |
| "Threats to be eliminated" | "Sick children who cannot be healed, only released" |
| "Abominations" | "The price of our ancestors' hubris" |

> *"We cannot heal them. We cannot save them. We can only release them from suffering."*

The Grove-Clans view the Unraveled not as monsters but as their own kin—families separated during the Gene-Storm, children lost to the Under-growth, loved ones whose bodies were rewritten into horror while their minds dissolved into agony.

**Mercy Patrols** conduct monthly operations into the Under-growth, granting quick death to Stage 3 Unraveled (70–100% vegetation coverage, zero conscious awareness) while avoiding Stage 2 individuals who retain awareness and cannot be ethically killed.

**Unraveled Soothe Salve**—a topical preparation providing 4–6 hours of pain relief to conscious Unraveled—demonstrates the depth of Grove-Clan compassion. Production yields 52 doses per quarterly cycle, with 10 doses donated to Under-growth border communities for humanitarian use without expectation of return.

## Society and Structure: The Canopy-Holds

### Living Architecture

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Settlement Type** | Canopy-Holds: living structures woven into Mother Tree boughs |
| **Elevation** | 40–100m above forest floor |
| **Construction** | 8+ Master Weavers using Iron-Root Vine, Spring-Wood Saplings, Whisper-Thatch |
| **Integration** | 95%+ growth bond with host tree within first season |
| **Connection** | Sky Looms cable ferries (3–5km spans) and rope bridge networks |

Grove-Clan settlements are not built—they are **grown**. Canopy-Holds are vast, woven structures of living wood fused into the upper boughs of the Mother Trees, connected by dizzying networks of rope bridges and vine-rails. Their entire culture is one of breathtaking agility and complete lack of acrophobia.

### The Druidic Council

| Threshold | Decision Type |
|-----------|---------------|
| **60% Consensus** | Routine resource allocation |
| **80% Consensus** | Inter-settlement disputes |
| **100% Unanimous** | Matters affecting Mother Trees |

Each settlement sends 2 Elders to the Druidic Council: 1 Ljósálfar spiritual leader and 1 baseline human practical administrator. This dual representation ensures both long-term sustainability wisdom and day-to-day operational expertise inform all decisions.

The system creates balanced governance where neither caste dominates—the Ljósálfar's centuries of accumulated wisdom complements the baseline population's practical grounding.

### Population Distribution

| Settlement | Specialty | Notable Products |
|------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Deepshade** | Fungal cultivation | Premium cultivars |
| **Dawnglow** | Crystal crafting | Crystal tools |
| **Greenspire** | Sacred harvest | Heartwood sap |
| **Skyreach** | Textile weaving | Living fiber garments |

Total population: **15,000–20,000** across **15–20 settlements** in the Canopy Sea.

---

## The Two Castes: Branches of One Tree

### The Ljósálfar (The Aether-Sown)

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Population** | 800–1,200 (20–25% of Grove-Clan total) |
| **Lifespan** | 300–400 years |
| **Appearance** | Taller, more graceful; faint pearlescent bioluminescence |
| **Capability** | Innate Aetheric perception; bio-theurgy healing; Mother Tree communion |
| **Vulnerability** | Perfect regeneration OR catastrophic Blight susceptibility |

The Ljósálfar are the descendants of high-level Vanir geneticists who were most directly attuned to Aetheric Flora. Generations of symbiosis have changed them—they exhibit faint pearlescent skin, enhanced perception, and an innate, intuitive connection to the Aether.

They are the natural healers, mystics, and spiritual leaders of the Clans.

**Bio-theurgy training** requires 15–40 years. Clinical applications include Gilded Lung reversal (>95% success rate for Stage 1), wound healing, and tissue regeneration. Emergency Medical Treaty partnerships allow Ljósálfar healers to respond to allied faction crises within 12 hours.

### Baseline Grove-Clan Members

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Population** | 8,000–12,000 (75–80% of Grove-Clan total) |
| **Lifespan** | Standard human |
| **Specializations** | Fungal cultivation, textile weaving, rope engineering, water systems |
| **Cultural Role** | Practical backbone; numerical majority; equal governance voice |

Baseline Grove-Clan members are the descendants of Vanir technicians and security personnel—hardy, agile, and practical. They form the strong, wooden bones of their culture: the hunters, warriors, builders, and artisans.

**Fungal cultivation** provides 60–70% of dietary calories through underground chambers maintaining 85–95% humidity. Typical yields: 8kg per m² per 7-day cycle.

**Living fiber textiles** (40–50 producing families) encode cultural identity through 8-pattern weaves representing: Mother Tree roots, Canopy Sea leaves, Gene-Storm trauma, Unraveled mourning, Sky Looms connection, Ljósálfar guidance, baseline resilience, and hope for restoration. Garments maintain 85–92% color-shift responsiveness to wearer bio-rhythms.

### The Coming-of-Age Trial

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Age Range** | 16–18 years |
| **Challenge** | 5km canopy navigation without rope infrastructure |
| **Time Limit** | 8 hours |
| **Success Rate** | 95–100% |
| **Completion Grants** | Adult status, voting rights, guild eligibility, independent dwelling |

The trial emphasizes practical competence over spiritual testing, asserting that baseline Grove-Clan members thrive in canopy environments through cleverness and diligent effort.

---

## Faith: The Great Growth

### Industrial Animism

| Aesir Worldview | Vanir Worldview | Grove-Clan Practice |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Universe as machine | Universe as garden | Living architecture |
| Command and control | Guide and cultivate | Symbiosis with ecosystem |
| Logic as supreme value | Growth as supreme value | Balance as supreme law |
| Gods as system administrators | Gods as master gardeners | The Great Growth as living presence |

The Grove-Clans practice a deeply personal Industrial Animism. They do not worship distant, sleeping gods of metal—they commune with the single, vast intelligence they call the **Great Growth**: the collective consciousness of the Vanaheim jungle itself.

### Mother Tree Veneration

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Quarterly Assessment** | Combined Aetheric perception scans + physical tissue sampling |
| **Health Threshold** | ≥90% vitality required; emergency intervention below |
| **Typical Readings** | 94–97% across 8 settlements |
| **Ultimate Taboo** | Harming a Mother Tree is the gravest crime |

**Heartwood Sap harvest** represents the most sacred resource collection, requiring explicit Mother Tree consent via Druidic Council communion. Maximum extraction: 0.3% of Tree's total sap volume per harvest. Typical autumn harvest yields 12.4 liters over 3 days using precision drilling (8mm diameter, 40cm depth) followed by bio-theurgy healing closure.

Trade value: **400–500 CU per liter**—10–20× silver premium as pure Aetheric energy source.

### The Ultimate Taboo: Freyja's Cradle

| Designation | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Official Name** | Genesis Engine Core |
| **Grove-Clan Names** | Freyja's Cradle, The Un-Womb |
| **Status** | Ground zero for Gene-Storm; still actively spewing mutagens |
| **Access** | Absolutely forbidden; ultimate monument to ancestral hubris |

The Grove-Clans fiercely guard the ruins of the primary Genesis Engine core. This is not reverence—it is **quarantine**. The Un-Womb is an active biological apocalypse, and approaching it means risking the same fate that claimed the Lost Kin.

---

## Environmental Challenges: Life in a Verdant Hell

### The Golden Plague

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Nature** | Airborne mutagenic catalyst (spores) |
| **Effect on Plants** | Rapid Hyper-Genesis (explosive growth) |
| **Effect on Humans** | Gilded Lung—terminal bio-mineralization |
| **Background Level** | Variable; spikes to 800+ ppm during Gene-Storm blooms |
| **Safe Threshold** | ≤0.3 ppm (Grove-Clan decontamination standard) |

The Grove-Clans suffer from chronic contamination by the Golden Plague—the persistent legacy of their ancestors' bio-engineering. Every breath carries risk. Every rainstorm may carry death.

### Gene-Storm Bloom Cycles

| Warning Sign | Indicator |
|--------------|-----------|
| **Glimmer-mite Silence** | ≥95% insect disappearance |
| **Temperature Drop** | ≥3°C within 2 hours |
| **Bioluminescence Shift** | Canopy flowers change color spectrum |
| **Aetheric Pressure** | Ljósálfar perceive "pressure building" |

Emergency response protocols achieve settlement evacuation within **28–30 minutes**, preventing casualties during 3–5m vegetation growth surges and Golden Plague spikes to 800+ ppm.

### Four-Stage Water Filtration

| Stage | Method | Function |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **1** | Moss screens | Coarse filtering |
| **2** | Charcoal beds | Golden Plague removal |
| **3** | Bio-theurgy purification | Ljósálfar weekly channeling |
| **4** | Crystal resonance | Final Aetheric cleansing |

System achieves **98% contamination removal**, reducing Golden Plague from 6.2 ppm input to 0.12 ppm output—enabling safe drinking water despite toxic atmospheric environment.

---

## Territorial Defense: Guardians of the Garden

### Guardian Forces

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Total Strength** | 142 across 8 major settlements |
| **Composition** | 75% baseline humans, 25% Ljósálfar |
| **Philosophy** | "Guardians are not soldiers seeking glory. We are gardeners protecting our home." |
| **Response Time** | 12–15 minutes (quarterly drill standard) |

### Training and Readiness

| Drill Type | Frequency | Performance Target |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Border Alert Response** | Quarterly | 12–15 minutes assembly |
| **Blight-Weaver Interdiction** | Quarterly | 94% strike precision |
| **Gene-Storm Evacuation** | Quarterly | 28–30 minutes full settlement |
| **Dual-Threat Scenarios** | Bi-annual | External raid + Gene-Storm simultaneous |

Documented performance: Guardian assembly 12 minutes, civilian evacuation 38 minutes (523 residents), 8% protocol violations (within 15% acceptable threshold).

### Blight-Weaver Interdiction

The Ljósálfar's greatest internal threat emerges from their own ranks—the **Seiðkona**, heretical Blight-Weavers who deliberately channel corrupted Aether. Guardian training emphasizes encirclement tactics requiring simultaneous attacks from multiple angles to prevent reality-warping escape.

Rogue Seiðkona who flee Vanaheim become wandering catastrophes; other factions request Grove-Clan assistance hunting confirmed practitioners.

---

## Diplomatic Framework: The Doctrine of Isolation

### Border Screening Protocols

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| **Equipment Audit** | 100% inspection; ≤0.3 ppm contamination threshold |
| **Personnel Hygiene** | Grove-approved compound bath |
| **Atmospheric Assessment** | Ljósálfar Aetheric perception scan for Blight markers |
| **Credentials Verification** | Diplomatic status confirmation |
| **Processing Time** | 45–90 minutes |
| **Rejection Rate** | 6.8% (contamination violations) |

The Grove-Clans view all outsiders with deep and profound suspicion. They see the surface world as a source of industrial poison and view sustained external contact as existential risk to their carefully maintained biological equilibrium.

### Trade Economics

| Product | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Heartwood Sap** | 400–500 CU/liter | 10–20× silver premium; pure Aetheric energy |
| **Living Fiber Textiles** | 60–180 CU | 85–92% bio-rhythm color-shift |
| **Unraveled Soothe Salve** | 1.1 CU/dose | Humanitarian distribution to border communities |
| **Fungal Cultivars** | Variable | Premium strains from Settlement Deepshade |
| **Emergency Medical Services** | Treaty-based | 12-hour response for allied factions |

Inter-settlement trade caravans operate quarterly, circulating 600–800kg cargo across 4–5 settlements per circuit. Trade value averages **4,850 CU per circuit**. External trade focuses on high-value, low-volume products requiring extraordinary contamination precautions.

---

## Factional Relations

### The Iron-Bane Crusade: Theological Ambivalence

| Iron-Bane View | Grove-Clan View |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Hardliners: "Corrupted abominations of the machine-curse." | "Their 'purifying flame' is anathema to our wooden world." |
| Moderates: "Blessed remnants; purity of intent matters." | "We observe their debates from safe distance." |
| Doctrine: "The Ljósálfar are either saints or demons—no middle ground." | "Their certainty is a luxury we cannot afford." |

The Iron-Banes exhibit wildly divergent congregational approaches to the Grove-Clans. Some chapters view the Ljósálfar as blessed remnants whose symbiosis represents spiritual purity; others see them as corrupted abominations no different from the machine-demons. The "purity of intent vs. form" debate remains unresolved.

The Grove-Clans maintain neutral observation policy, neither courting nor antagonizing the Crusade.

### The God-Sleepers: Living Saints Veneration

| God-Sleeper View | Grove-Clan View |
|------------------|-----------------|
| "The Ljósálfar are inheritors of divine Vanir bloodline." | "Their veneration makes us uncomfortable." |
| "Mother Trees are Freyja's Dreams made manifest." | "We do not worship the Mother Trees; we tend them." |
| "Light-Touch Pilgrimages to Vanaheim borders are sacred duty." | "Pilgrims who respect contamination protocols may observe." |

God-Sleepers regard the Ljósálfar with profound reverence—living saints, descendants of the divine Vanir, proof that the old gods' children still walk the world. They obsess over genealogical connections to pre-Glitch ancestry and maintain Light-Bringer Shrines at Vanaheim borders where families leave offerings.

The Grove-Clans tolerate this attention cautiously, neither encouraging worship nor rejecting diplomatic overtures.

### The Jötun-Readers: Research Partnership

| Jötun-Reader View | Grove-Clan View |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| "Invaluable research subjects in biological adaptation." | "Their desire for knowledge is dangerous but useful." |
| "The tragedy provides diagnostic data on cascade failure." | "They understand our ancestors' technology." |
| "Alchemical mastery highly valued by our Guilds." | "Trade in knowledge serves mutual interest." |

The Scriptorium views the Grove-Clans as an "invaluable research subject" in human biological adaptation to a "cancerous hell." Their mastery of herbalism and alchemical salves is highly valued by the Alchemist Guild.

Shared research initiatives proceed under strict contamination protocols—the Grove-Clans permit limited specimen collection and data sharing in exchange for technical knowledge and medical supplies.

### The Dvergr Guilds: Engineering Admiration

| Dvergr View | Grove-Clan View |
|-------------|-----------------|
| "The Mother Trees are the ultimate engineering achievement." | "They appreciate our ancestors' work, not our suffering." |
| "Methodological friction: systematic analysis vs. intuitive attunement." | "Their logic cannot grasp the Great Growth." |
| "Golden Plague containment collaboration benefits both parties." | "Practical partnership serves survival." |

The Dvergr recognize Mother Trees as bio-engineering marvels surpassing their own mechanical achievements. Defense partnership proposals remain under consideration—the Grove-Clans weigh security benefits against contamination risks from sustained Dvergr presence.

### The Midgard Hearth-Clans: Light Elf Legends

| Hearth-Clan View | Grove-Clan View |
|------------------|-----------------|
| "Light Elves of legend—Children of the First Garden." | "Their stories preserve what we have lost." |
| "Miracle healers who cure the incurable." | "We help when we can; we cannot save everyone." |
| "Proof that paradise survived somewhere." | "We tend a garden that is also a graveyard." |

Common folk maintain Light-Bringer Shrines at borders, leaving offerings for families experiencing medical crises. Stories of miracle healing—Golden Plague cures, wound sealing, even "resurrection"—spread hope across Midgard's struggling communities.

The Grove-Clans fulfill this role reluctantly, knowing they cannot meet every desperate plea.

---

## Strategic Value: The Genetic Rosetta Stone

### Project Idunn

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Nature** | Genetic archives preserving pre-Glitch Vanir research |
| **Content** | Human-Aether symbiosis templates; original Genesis Engine documentation |
| **Access** | Restricted; uncertain availability even to Grove-Clan leadership |
| **Strategic Importance** | Potential key to reversing Blight effects; understanding Aetheric biology |

The Grove-Clans may possess the most valuable knowledge repository in Aethelgard—Project Idunn, genetic archives containing the Vanir's research into human-Aether symbiosis. Whether these archives survived the Gene-Storm, and whether current Grove-Clan leadership can access them, remains uncertain.

### Bio-Theurgy Knowledge

| Capability | Application |
|------------|-------------|
| **Gilded Lung Reversal** | >95% success rate for Stage 1 cases |
| **Wound Healing** | Accelerated tissue regeneration |
| **Contamination Cleansing** | Aetheric purification of polluted materials |
| **Emergency Response** | 12-hour treaty deployment to allied factions |

Centuries of accumulated healing technique refinement make Ljósálfar bio-theurgy the most sophisticated medical practice in post-Glitch Aethelgard. Training partnerships with diplomatic allies spread these techniques—slowly, carefully, with extensive contamination protocols.

---

## The Grove-Warden (Player Specialization)

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Archetype** | Healer / Controller |
| **Primary Attributes** | WILL / VIGOR |
| **Core Identity** | Symbiotic defender; biological harmony specialist |
| **Special Feature** | Environmental Attunement; shapeshifting forms; bio-theurgy healing |
| **Trauma Risk** | Moderate (connection to corrupted ecosystems creates psychological strain) |

The Grove-Warden specialization represents someone trained in the Grove-Clan tradition of biological harmony—channeling the power of uncorrupted nature to heal allies, control enemies, and restore balance to Blight-touched environments.

### Key Abilities

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the high places where the air is sweet and the leaves sing with the voices of the First Garden, the Children of Light tend their wounded paradise. They weep for the Lost Kin who wander below, trapped in flesh that will not stop growing, in pain that will not end. They guard the Mother Trees whose roots drink deep of ancient sorrow. They heal those who come in peace and ward those who come with flame. They are the last gardeners of a world that burned its own garden—and they will tend what remains until the final leaf falls."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Grove-Clans represent one of post-Glitch humanity's most successful adaptations to catastrophic environmental collapse, yet their success is defined by profound tragedy. Their two-caste integrated society—baseline humans providing practical administration while Ljósálfar provide spiritual guidance and bio-theurgy healing—demonstrates sustainable governance under extreme contamination pressure. Population maintenance requires continuous environmental management: four-stage water filtration, Gene-Storm early warning, and strict decontamination protocols for external contact. Strategic value derives from preserved Vanir biological knowledge, bio-theurgy medical capabilities, and potential access to Project Idunn genetic archives."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"FACTION CLASSIFICATION: Grove-Clans (Vanaheim Survivors). ORGANIZATIONAL TYPE: Integrated two-caste survivor population. PRIMARY FUNCTION: Ecosystem preservation; biological knowledge custody. SECONDARY FUNCTION: Medical services; contamination management. POPULATION: 15,000–20,000 (baseline 75–80%; Ljósálfar 20–25%). TERRITORY: Canopy Sea (15–20 settlements at 40–100m elevation). RISK PROFILE: Low (to respectful visitors); High (to contamination violators). STRATEGIC ASSETS: Bio-theurgy healing, Vanir genetic archives, Mother Tree infrastructure. STRATEGIC LIABILITIES: Extreme isolationism, environmental fragility, Golden Plague burden."*

---

## Summary

The Grove-Clans are the last gardeners of a paradise that became a hell.

Where the Iron-Banes seek to **destroy** the corruption and the God-Sleepers seek to **worship** it, the Grove-Clans have found a third path—a path of **tending**, of **mourning**, of **careful, sorrowful stewardship** over what remains of their ancestors' greatest achievement and greatest failure.

They live in the canopy of colossal trees their ancestors engineered.

They filter poison from their water and count spores in their air.

They send Mercy Patrols into the depths to grant release to the Lost Kin—their own ancestors, trapped in flesh that will not stop growing, in agony that will not end.

They are not conquerors.

They are not crusaders.

They are survivors.

And survival, in the Canopy Sea, means making peace with perpetual grief.

The surface world sees them as mysterious Light Elves—miracle healers who can cure the incurable, savage recluses who attack trespassers without warning. Both perceptions contain truth. The Grove-Clans **will** heal those who come in genuine need, who respect their contamination protocols, who understand that every visit carries risk.

And they **will** defend their wounded paradise against those who bring flame, or filth, or the hubris that broke the world.

They guard Freyja's Cradle—the Un-Womb—not out of reverence but out of **terror**. That place still spews the mutagens that created the Unraveled. It must never be opened. It must never be studied. It must only be **contained**.

Their ancestors tried to play god with life itself.

The Grove-Clans have learned the cost.

They tend what remains.

They mourn what was lost.

They wait for a healing that may never come.

And every day, they listen to the screams of the Lost Kin rising from the roots, and they remember:

*This is what hubris costs.*

*This is what remains.*

*This is what we must protect.*

The world calls them the Grieving Gardeners.

They call themselves something simpler.

**Survivors.**

And survivors tend what remains.
