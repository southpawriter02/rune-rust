## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Administer Antidote is the Bone-Setter's **poison/disease cleanse**—a consumable-based ability that removes [Poisoned] or [Disease] effects. This complements Apply Tourniquet by covering different status effects.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Remove [Poisoned] or [Disease] status from ally
- **Secondary:** Requires consumable, creating preparation requirements
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The prepared healer with the right medicine for the situation

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High situational value
- **Consumable Requirement:** Cannot spam; requires preparation
- **Single Effect:** Removes one status per use

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The venom is spreading—dark lines tracing toward the heart along the victim's veins. The Bone-Setter recognizes the pattern, knows the source, knows the counter. A vial from their kit, carefully measured dose, administered with precision timing. The antidote fights the poison on a cellular level, buying time for the body to recover.

### Thematic Resonance

Aethelgard is full of things that poison both body and mind. The Bone-Setter's preparation ensures that a single venomous bite doesn't spell doom for the expedition.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Activation

- **Action Type:** Standard Action
- **Consumable Cost:** 1 [Common Antidote] from inventory
- **Range:** Touch (adjacent ally)
- **Target:** Single ally with [Poisoned] or [Disease]

### Effect

**Removes ONE of the following status effects from target ally:**

- [Poisoned]
- [Disease]

*If target has both, Bone-Setter chooses which to remove.*

### [Poisoned] Status Reminder

- Deals damage at end of affected character's turn
- May reduce attributes or impose penalties depending on poison type
- Duration varies by source

### [Disease] Status Reminder

- Long-term debilitating effects
- May spread to other party members
- Often requires specific treatment to remove

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Targeting:** Bone-Setter selects adjacent ally with [Poisoned] or [Disease]
2. **Consumable Check:** Verify [Common Antidote] in inventory
3. **Consumable Consumption:** Remove antidote from inventory
4. **Status Selection:** If multiple valid statuses, Bone-Setter chooses one
5. **Cleanse Application:** Remove selected status from target

### [Common Antidote] Crafting

- Crafted via Field Medicine at Campfire or Lab
- Requires common reagents (herbs, minerals)
- Enhanced by Field Medic I bonus die

## IV. Progression Path

### Rank 1 (Base — This Ability)

- Remove [Poisoned] OR [Disease] from adjacent ally
- Consumes 1 [Common Antidote]

### Rank 2 (Expert — 20 PP)

- Remove [Poisoned] OR [Disease] from ally within 2 meters
- **New:** If target has both [Poisoned] and [Disease], remove BOTH
- **New:** Target gains immunity to [Poisoned] for 1 turn after cleanse

### Rank 3 (Mastery — Capstone)

- Remove [Poisoned] AND [Disease] from ally within 4 meters
- Target gains immunity to [Poisoned] and [Disease] for 2 turns
- **New:** Can use [Enhanced Antidote] to affect 2 adjacent allies simultaneously
- **New:** Remaining potency heals 1d8 HP after cleanse

---

## V. Tactical Applications

1. **Poison Counters:** Essential against venomous creatures, poisoned weapons
2. **Disease Management:** Critical for contagion-type encounters
3. **Exploration Safety:** Poison traps and toxic environments are common
4. **Long Expeditions:** Disease effects worsen over time; early treatment critical
5. **Preparation Payoff:** Having antidotes ready makes encounters manageable

---

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Field Medic I:** Superior crafting produces more antidotes efficiently
- **Enemies with poison mechanics:** Maximum value against venomous foes
- **Exploration-heavy expeditions:** More environmental hazards to counter
- **"First, Do No Harm" (Tier 3):** Triggers defensive bonus after use

### Negative Synergies

- **No antidotes:** Completely ineffective without consumables
- **Encounters without poison/disease:** Wasted preparation
- **Action economy:** Standard Action for situational cleanse
