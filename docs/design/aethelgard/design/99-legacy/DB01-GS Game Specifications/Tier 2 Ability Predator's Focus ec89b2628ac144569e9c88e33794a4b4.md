## Core Identity

Your mind is a fortress of calm focus. By concentrating on the familiar rhythm of the hunt—**the draw, the aim, the release**—you can partially filter out the maddening psychic noise of your corrupted prey. The hunt centers you.

## Tactical Applications

**Stress Management:**

- Essential for long expeditions in Blighted areas
- Enables sustained use of Mark for Death (which inflicts Stress)
- Synergizes with back-row ranged combat positioning

**Synergies:**

- **Mark for Death:** Offsets the Psychic Stress cost
- **Set Snare:** Keeps enemies away from your position
- **Aimed Shot:** Rewards maintaining safe distance

## Design Philosophy

The Veiðimaðr's power comes from **patient observation and precise execution**, not from chaos or reckless abandon. This passive rewards that playstyle by making back-row positioning even more valuable—you're not just safer physically, you're mentally fortified against the Blight's psychic toll.
