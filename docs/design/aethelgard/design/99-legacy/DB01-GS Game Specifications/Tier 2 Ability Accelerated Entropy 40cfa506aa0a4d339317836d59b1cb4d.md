## Core Identity

**Specialization:** Rust-Witch (Agent of Entropy)

**Tier:** 2 (Advanced Decay)

**Type:** Passive

**Prerequisite:** 8 PP in Rust-Witch tree, Corrosive Curse + Entropic Field + 1 other Tier 1 ability

**Cost:** 3 PP

---

## Description

The act of unmaking fuels your power. You have learned to draw Aether directly from the systems you break down, creating a feedback loop where decay begets more decay. As your enemies crumble and rust, their structural collapse feeds your magic. You are sustained by entropy itself.

---

## Mechanics

### Passive Effect

**Trigger:** Whenever an enemy takes damage from YOUR [Corroded] effects

**Effect:** Regain **+3 Aether** per damage instance

### Clarifications

| Scenario | Aether Gained |
| --- | --- |
| [Corroded] on 1 enemy | +3 per turn |
| [Corroded] on 3 enemies | +9 per turn |
| [Corroded] x3 stacks on 1 enemy | +3 per turn (one instance) |

### Sustain Loop

Curse → Enemy takes DoT → You regain Aether → Cast more curses

---

## Tactical Applications

1. **Resource Sustain:** Makes extended fights sustainable without running dry
2. **Spread Encourages:** More debuffed enemies = more Aether regeneration
3. **Flash Rust Synergy:** Hit 3 enemies = +9 Aether per turn
4. **Long Fight Dominance:** The longer combat goes, the more self-sustaining you become

---

## Integration Notes

- **No Corruption Cost:** Pure resource management, not entropy channeling
- **Scales with Playstyle:** Aggressive debuff spreading = high Aether generation
- **Transforms Playstyle:** From burst caster into sustained attrition specialist
