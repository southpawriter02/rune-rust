# The Myr-Stalker — The Antibody of a Dying World

> *"You see a toxic swamp and you think: death trap. You think: avoid at all costs. I see home. The mire that poisons you sustains me. The corruption that kills others makes me stronger. I have achieved what the weak call 'impossible'—I have made peace with the rot. Not by resisting it, but by becoming part of it. Now I wield the world's decay as a weapon. My blade drips with distilled entropy. My traps bloom with cultivated blight. And when I face enemies in the ruins, I simply lead them into the poison and wait. They die. I heal. That is the philosophy of symbiosis."*

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Ranger |
| **Role** | Entropic Assassin / Poison Specialist / Swamp Master |
| **Path Type** | Heretical |
| **Primary Attribute** | FINESSE |
| **Secondary Attribute** | WITS |
| **Tertiary Attribute** | STURDINESS |
| **Resource System** | Stamina |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | High (Corruption accumulation) |

The **Myr-Stalker** is the Ranger specialization that has achieved **heretical symbiosis with the Runic Blight's physical corruption**.[^]

Where others flee from toxic mires and blighted swamps, the Myr-Stalker thrives. They do not fight the world's decay—they weaponize it. They are masters of damage-over-time warfare, patient hunters who coat their blades in distilled entropy, lay traps of weaponized blight, and watch their enemies rot from within.

To choose the Myr-Stalker is to embrace the philosophy that **the fastest way to defeat a corrupted system is to make it crash faster**. Your saga is written in the language of rot. You are the antibody of a dying world.

## Core Philosophy: Symbiosis with Decay

### The Heretical Adaptation

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Embrace, Don't Resist** | The Blight cannot be fought; it must be joined |
| **Entropy as Weapon** | Decay kills enemies; it sustains you |
| **Patient Predation** | Strike, poison, withdraw, wait |

The Myr-Stalker's body has undergone **heretical adaptation**.[^] Poisons no longer harm them—they sustain them. Toxic environments that kill others heal the Myr-Stalker. This is not corruption in the traditional sense; it is evolution through acceptance.

> *"The others try to fight the Blight. They build barriers. They wear masks. They burn infected flesh. And they all fail, eventually, because you cannot defeat something that is part of the world's new fundamental code. I chose a different path. I let the Blight in. I let it rewrite my cells, my organs, my very biology. Now we are not enemies—we are partners. I feed it. It feeds me. And together, we are stronger than either of us alone."*

Their philosophy is darkly pragmatic: the strongest survivors are those who **adapt to—and exploit—the very forces that killed everything else**.

### The Price of Power

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Source** | Heretical symbiosis with physical corruption |
| **Method** | DoT warfare; environmental exploitation; alchemical poison |
| **Cost** | Permanent Corruption accumulation |
| **Philosophy** | Power because you are rotting, not in spite of it |

The Myr-Stalker's power comes from **willingly accumulating Runic Blight Corruption**.[^] Every poison resisted, every hour spent in toxic zones, every rest in a corrupted biome advances their own decay. They are powerful because they are rotting.

> *"You ask about the cost? Look at my skin—the gray patches, the veins that glow faintly green in darkness. Look at my eyes—the pupils that have stretched into vertical slits. I am changing. Every day, I become less human and more... something else. Some call it a curse. I call it a down payment. The power I gain is worth the flesh I lose. And when I finally become Forlorn? Perhaps that is simply the final stage of my evolution."*

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Master of toxic environments; patient predator; walking biohazard |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Methodical, attrition-focused damage dealer |
| **Success Metric** | Stacking DoTs; fighting in zones that harm enemies but heal you |
| **Decision Space** | Where to apply poisons; when to create hazard zones; managing Corruption |

Playing a Myr-Stalker is about **patient predation and environmental dominance**.[^]

Your operational loop is:
1. **Apply**: Use Venom-Laced Shiv and traps to apply [Poisoned] and [Corroded]
2. **Stack**: Build multiple DoT effects on priority targets (up to 5 stacks)
3. **Endure**: Use environmental immunity to fight in zones that harm enemies
4. **Harvest**: Convert your own Corruption into increased poison potency via Corruption Catalyst
5. **Wait**: Let your DoTs do the work while you fade back safely

> *"I don't fight like a Warrior. I don't trade blows until someone falls. I strike once, apply my toxins, then fade back into the mire. My enemies don't die to my blade—they die to the poison spreading through their veins an hour later. They die to the corrosive haze eating through their armor. They die to the trap they didn't see until they stepped in it. By the time they realize they're doomed, I'm already gone."*

You're not a burst damage dealer—you're a **patient predator** who strikes, poisons, and waits.

### The Trade-Off

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Thrives in toxic environments | Clean environments remove advantages |
| DoTs bypass armor and resistances | Burst damage races end before DoTs shine |
| Environmental hazards become sanctuaries | High Corruption accumulation = Forlorn risk |
| Stacking DoTs provide massive sustained damage | Poison-immune enemies negate core mechanic |
| Self-sustaining through hazard healing | Requires extended combat for DoT value |

The Myr-Stalker is **devastating in their element** but pays for it with their soul. They will accumulate Corruption faster than any Coherent specialization.

> *"The trade-off is simple: power now, price later. Every poison I resist adds to my Corruption. Every night I sleep in a blighted swamp stains my soul a little more. The Jötun-Readers say I'm 'asymptotically approaching Forlorn status.' I say I'm optimizing my build. The closer I get to the edge, the deadlier my poisons become. It's not madness. It's mathematics."*

## Core Mechanics: The Three Pillars

### Pillar 1: Blighted Symbiosis

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Complete immunity to Poison and Disease; healing from toxic environments |
| **Cost** | +1 Corruption every time you resist Poison/Disease |
| **Benefit** | Toxic terrain heals instead of damages |
| **Result** | Turn environmental hazards into sanctuaries |

**Blighted Symbiosis** is the foundational mechanic—the heretical adaptation that defines the specialization.[^]

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

> *"My body has been rewritten at the cellular level. What was poison is now nutrition. What was disease is now symbiotic organism. I walk through clouds of corrosive gas and breathe deep—it's like fresh mountain air to me. I wade through toxic mires and feel the Blight seeping into my wounds, closing them. The others see a death zone. I see a spa."*[^]

### Pillar 2: Stacking DoT Warfare

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Apply [Poisoned] and [Corroded] status effects that stack |

| **[Poisoned]** | 1d6 damage/turn | 5 | 5d6 damage/turn |
| **[Corroded]** | -1 Armor + 1d4 damage | 5 | -5 Armor + 5d4 damage/turn |

> *"One stack of poison is an inconvenience. Five stacks is a death sentence. The beauty of my method is that I don't need to land a killing blow—I just need to land enough poisoned strikes. Then I wait. The enemy's body does the rest, fighting itself as my toxins multiply and spread. By the time they're at half health from direct damage, the DoTs have already ensured they won't survive the next three turns."*

### Pillar 3: Corruption Catalyst

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Your Corruption level increases your DoT damage |
| **0-25 Corruption** | +0 damage per stack |
| **26-50 Corruption** | +1 damage per stack |

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

> *"The Jötun-Readers were fascinated when they measured my toxin potency against my Corruption levels. There's a direct correlation—the more Blight saturates my system, the more virulent my poisons become. At 25 Corruption, I'm a competent poisoner. At 75 Corruption, I'm a walking biological weapon. At 100? I'm one failed Resolve Check from becoming Forlorn... but my poisons could kill a Jötun-Forged."*[^]
