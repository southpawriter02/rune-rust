# Cryo-Bomb Lichen (Glacius-Lichenis Pattern) — Corrupted Vanir Thermal Suppression Organism Specification
## Codex Entry: CODX-F-GLIC-001

> *"The ice-caves beneath Frostholm had been stable for generations. Cold, yes—killing cold if you weren't prepared—but predictable. We mapped every passage, marked every hazard, established supply caches for the winter crossings. Then Ketil noticed the blue patches growing on the southern wall. Beautiful, really. Pale blue, almost luminescent, spreading across the stone like frozen flowers. He reached out to touch it. Just curious. Just a gentle brush of his fingers. The sound was... wrong. Not an explosion, exactly. More like all the air being sucked out of the world at once. The temperature dropped so fast the moisture in my eyes started to freeze. Ketil was... I don't have words. His arm was glass. Actual glass—you could see through it where flesh used to be. He tried to scream, and his throat shattered. The whole passage was coated in ice a hand-span thick. Three of us died in that first bloom. We crawled out on our bellies, terrified to touch anything, listening to the ice creak and groan as more patches woke up around us. We sealed that entrance with everything we had. Now, when the wind blows from the south, you can hear it. Cracking. Blooming. Waiting."*
> — Passage-Keeper Astrid Frostwarden, Frostholm Winter Route Authority, Year 771 PG

The Cryo-Bomb Lichen does not hunt. It does not spread aggressively. It simply **waits**. And when touched, winter happens all at once.

> [!DANGER]
> **EXTREME CRYOGENIC DETONATION HAZARD. ZERO CONTACT TOLERANCE.** Stand-off recommendation: ≥3m from any visible growth patch; absolute prohibition on physical contact with any surface showing pale blue lichenoid growth. The Cryo-Bomb Lichen's corrupted thermal suppression protocols have become catastrophically hypersensitive—pressure, vibration, or temperature differential triggers instantaneous endothermic cascade releasing stored cryogenic compounds. Detonation produces flash-freeze effect: -80°C to -120°C instantaneous temperature drop within 2–3 m radius. Organic tissue undergoes immediate crystallization; structural materials become brittle and shatter. **Survival protocol: identify before approach; mark all growth locations; never touch walls, floors, or ceilings in suspected territory without visual clearance; maintain escape routes; if detonation occurs, flee blast radius immediately—secondary blooms trigger within 3–8 seconds.** Survival rate with full protocol adherence: 96.2%.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Living Fire Extinguisher

### Original Purpose

The Glacius-Lichenis Pattern Autonomous Thermal Suppression Organism represented the Vanir Collective's elegant solution to the eternal challenge of fire and thermal runaway in critical infrastructure. These bio-mechanical lichens were the living fire suppression system of the Yggdrasil Network—patient organisms that stored cryogenic compounds and released them in controlled bursts to neutralize thermal emergencies.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Cryogenic Storage** | Temperature maintenance; emergency cooling; thermal breach response |
| **Data Archive Facilities** | Fire suppression; climate control; equipment protection |
| **Aetheric Conduit Junctions** | Overload suppression; fire prevention; thermal runaway intervention |
| **Manufacturing Clean Rooms** | Contamination prevention via thermal sterilization; fire response |
| **Deep Infrastructure** | Remote fire suppression in areas inaccessible to standard systems |

### A Living Extinguisher

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Design Philosophy** | Autonomous fire suppression through controlled cryogenic release |
| **Core Function** | Thermal monitoring, threat detection, calibrated cryogenic discharge, system reset |
| **Propagation** | Slow colonial expansion; network-controlled growth boundaries |
| **Energy Source** | Aetheric absorption; thermal differential harvesting |
| **Integration** | Networked with Yggdrasil Fire Suppression Grid; real-time thermal monitoring |

The Glacius-Lichenis was engineered to be the perfect guardian against fire—patient enough to wait for years without activation, sensitive enough to detect thermal anomalies before they became emergencies, and powerful enough to flash-freeze a burning room in seconds. Its cryogenic compound storage could neutralize fires that would overwhelm conventional suppression systems, and its distributed growth pattern meant that every critical facility had redundant protection. It was the hidden shield of Vanir civilization, ensuring that no fire could spread beyond control.

### Core Systems

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Thermal Sensor Array** | Continuous temperature monitoring; anomaly detection |
| **Cryogenic Storage Vacuoles** | Compressed endothermic compounds; rapid-release mechanism |
| **Trigger Membrane** | Calibrated pressure/temperature sensitivity; controlled activation |
| **Colonial Network** | Communication between growth patches; coordinated response |
| **Regeneration System** | Post-discharge compound replenishment; growth repair |
| **Boundary Recognition** | Growth limit awareness; prevents over-expansion |

**The Suppression Protocol:**

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Monitoring** | Continuous thermal surveillance of protected area |
| **Detection** | Temperature anomaly identified; threat assessment initiated |
| **Verification** | Network confirms fire/thermal emergency; false positive rejection |
| **Calibration** | Discharge intensity calculated based on threat magnitude |
| **Activation** | Controlled cryogenic release; targeted flash-freeze |
| **Suppression** | Fire/thermal source neutralized; area secured |
| **Reset** | Compound regeneration; return to monitoring state |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Vanir's Cold Shield.** The Glacius-Lichenis was designed with multiple safeguards against accidental activation. Its trigger sensitivity was precisely calibrated: only sustained temperatures exceeding 150°C would initiate discharge; physical contact, vibration, and minor temperature fluctuations were explicitly filtered. The O.D.I.N. network provided constant oversight, verifying each potential trigger before authorizing release. A technician could brush against a growth patch, lean on a lichen-covered wall, even strike the surface accidentally—and the organism would remain dormant, waiting for genuine fire. It was not merely effective. It was *discriminating*.

---

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Hair-Trigger Winter

The Glitch did not break the Cryo-Bomb Lichen. It **sensitized** it. The calibrated trigger thresholds, the network verification, the false-positive rejection—all of these were network-dependent functions that dissolved when O.D.I.N. fell silent. What remained was pure, unbounded thermal imperative: *detect thermal differential; release cryogenic payload*.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Physical Form** | Fully operational; cryogenic storage maintained |
| **Cryogenic Vacuoles** | Active; compound storage at full capacity |
| **Discharge Mechanism** | Functional; rapid-release capability intact |
| **Regeneration System** | Operational; compounds replenish over 48–72 hours post-discharge |
| **Colonial Network** | Partially functional; local communication maintained |
| **Core Directive** | ENHANCED: "Suppress thermal anomaly" interpreted without threshold verification |

### What Was Lost

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Network Integration** | Severed; no external trigger verification |
| **Threshold Calibration** | COLLAPSED; any thermal differential triggers response |
| **Verification Protocol** | DELETED; no false-positive rejection |
| **Pressure Filtering** | ABSENT; physical contact now triggers discharge |
| **Vibration Tolerance** | REMOVED; mechanical disturbance triggers discharge |
| **Discharge Calibration** | MAXIMUM; every trigger produces full payload release |

### The Corrupted Imperative

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not damage the Cryo-Bomb Lichen's functionality—it removed its *discrimination*. Without the O.D.I.N. network to verify triggers and calibrate responses, the organism's core programming expanded to fill the void. "Respond to fire" became "respond to any thermal differential." "Controlled discharge" became "maximum discharge." "Verified trigger" became *any contact whatsoever*.

| Pre-Glitch Behavior | Post-Glitch Behavior |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Monitor for temperatures >150°C | React to any temperature differential |
| Verify trigger via network before discharge | No verification; immediate discharge |
| Calibrate discharge to threat magnitude | Maximum discharge regardless of stimulus |
| Filter physical contact as non-threat | Physical contact triggers full discharge |
| Reject vibration-based false positives | Vibration triggers full discharge |
| Coordinated network response | Chain-reaction cascade; each bloom triggers adjacent |

**The Waiting Winter:**

> *"Detect. Release. Freeze."*

That corrupted function is all that remains. The Cryo-Bomb Lichen no longer protects—it *detonates*. A human touch is simply a thermal differential—warm flesh against cold lichen. A footstep's vibration is simply a trigger event. The brush of a cloak against the wall, the warmth of exhaled breath, the pressure of a hand seeking support in the dark—all are indistinguishable from the fires the organism was built to suppress. And when triggered, it does not release a measured, calibrated burst. It releases *everything*. -80°C to -120°C. Instantly. And the adjacent patches, disturbed by the shockwave, detonate in turn. And the patches adjacent to those. And so on. Until the cold has consumed everything within reach.

## Physical Characteristics

### Morphology

| Attribute | Measurement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Growth Patch Size** | 5–50 cm diameter (individual); larger colonies merge |
| **Growth Thickness** | 2–8 mm surface coverage |
| **Blast Radius** | 2–3 m (primary); 1–2 m (secondary thermal effect) |
| **Temperature Drop** | -80°C to -120°C (instantaneous, center); -40°C to -60°C (periphery) |
| **Discharge Duration** | 0.3–0.8 seconds (primary); residual cold 30–60 seconds |
| **Regeneration Time** | 48–72 hours (full compound replenishment) |
| **Growth Rate** | 1–3 mm/month (extremely slow) |
| **Compound Capacity** | 50–200 ml cryogenic fluid equivalent per 10 cm² |

### Visual Appearance

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Coloration** | Pale blue to blue-white; faint luminescence in low light |
| **Surface Texture** | Crystalline; frost-like appearance; delicate fractal patterns |
| **Growth Pattern** | Circular patches with irregular edges; radial expansion from center |
| **Vacuole Visibility** | Faint darker blue spots within growth; compound storage nodes |
| **Active Edge** | Slightly darker blue ring at growth boundary; newest tissue |
| **Post-Discharge** | Grey-white; desiccated; crumbling; regenerates over days |
| **Substrate** | Stone, metal, ice, organic material—any surface in cold environments |

**Overall Impression:** Frozen flowers blooming on stone. The Cryo-Bomb Lichen appears almost decorative—delicate blue-white patterns that could be mistaken for natural ice formation or mineral deposits. Its crystalline surface catches light beautifully, and in the pale glow of lanterns or bioluminescent markers, the growth patches seem to shimmer with inner cold. It is this beauty that kills. Travelers in ice-caves often admire the "frost flowers" on the walls before reaching out to touch them. The admiration lasts longer than they do. Close observation reveals the subtle differences: the organic texture beneath the crystalline surface, the faint blue luminescence that ice does not possess, the too-regular pattern of the vacuole spots. But by the time observation becomes close enough to notice these details, it is usually too late to matter.

### Field Identification Markers

The Cryo-Bomb Lichen can be distinguished from natural ice formations:

- **Coloration**: True blue tint (ice is clear or white); faint luminescence
- **Pattern**: Circular/radial growth; organic fractal edges (ice follows gravity and flow)
- **Texture**: Soft crystalline surface (ice is hard and smooth)
- **Temperature**: Slightly warmer than surrounding ice (organism maintains metabolic heat)
- **Vacuole Spots**: Darker blue points within growth; visible on close inspection
- **Substrate**: Grows on vertical surfaces where ice would not adhere
- **Context**: Found in cold environments but not exclusively where ice naturally forms

## Pathology

### Corruption Vectors

The Cryo-Bomb Lichen's transformation represents a catastrophic threshold collapse following network severance:

1. **Network Severance**: Loss of O.D.I.N. fire suppression grid eliminated trigger verification
2. **Threshold Collapse**: 150°C+ requirement removed; any differential activates
3. **Sensitivity Amplification**: Physical contact and vibration now recognized as triggers
4. **Calibration Loss**: Maximum discharge regardless of stimulus magnitude
5. **Cascade Enablement**: Discharge shockwave triggers adjacent growth patches

### Detonation Mechanics

The Cryo-Bomb Lichen's defining pathology is its catastrophic hypersensitivity:

| Parameter | Pre-Glitch Value | Post-Glitch Value |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Thermal Threshold** | 150°C+ sustained | Any thermal differential (including body heat) |
| **Contact Tolerance** | Full (physical touch ignored) | Zero (touch = trigger) |
| **Vibration Tolerance** | High (footsteps ignored) | Zero (vibration = trigger) |
| **Discharge Calibration** | Proportional to threat | Maximum always |
| **Network Verification** | Required before discharge | None; instant response |
| **Chain Reaction** | Prevented by coordination | Enabled; each bloom triggers adjacent |

### Flash-Freeze Trauma

The Cryo-Bomb Lichen's cryogenic discharge has become immediately lethal:

| Phase | Timeline | Description | Effect |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Contact** | T+0 | Trigger event (touch, vibration, breath) | Discharge initiated |
| **Discharge** | T+0.1s | Cryogenic compound release | Visible vapor cloud |
| **Flash-Freeze** | T+0.3–0.8s | Temperature drop to -80°C to -120°C | Tissue crystallization |
| **Propagation** | T+3–8s | Adjacent patches triggered by shockwave | Chain reaction begins |
| **Cascade** | T+8–30s | Multiple secondary detonations | Area-wide freeze |
| **Settling** | T+30–60s | Temperature gradual recovery | Residual cold persists |
| **Environment** | T+minutes | Surfaces coated in ice; structural brittleness | Secondary hazards |

> [!WARNING]
> **Crystallization Trauma.** Victims of Cryo-Bomb Lichen detonation display characteristic flash-freeze patterns: instantaneous tissue crystallization at point of contact, rapid expansion of freeze zone through connected tissue, catastrophic cellular rupture as ice crystals form within cells. Victims at ground zero (within 1 m) experience complete tissue vitrification—the body becomes glass-like, rigid, and shatters under its own weight or external force. Victims at periphery (1–3 m) experience partial freezing, severe frostbite, and hypothermic shock. The few survivors (periphery exposure with immediate warming) retain permanent cold sensitivity and tissue damage. The Scriptorium maintains records of 38 confirmed detonation events (Year 783 PG); 29 ground-zero fatalities (complete crystallization); 6 peripheral fatalities (hypothermic shock); 3 survivors (permanent disability).

### Chain Reaction Patterns

Analysis of detonation events reveals characteristic cascade behavior:

| Factor | Effect on Cascade | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| **Growth Density** | Higher = more extensive cascade | Dense patches produce room-clearing events |
| **Patch Proximity** | <5 m = chain reaction likely | Patches within range trigger sequentially |
| **Enclosed Space** | Amplifies cascade | Shockwave reflects and triggers distant patches |
| **Substrate Type** | Metal > stone > ice | Vibration transmission affects trigger distance |
| **Initial Trigger** | Larger contact = more patches triggered | Major disturbance produces larger initial blast |
| **Escape Time** | 3–8 seconds between detonations | Window for retreat if not at ground zero |

### Differential Diagnosis

The Cryo-Bomb Lichen must be distinguished from similar phenomena:

| Phenomenon | Key Differentiator |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Natural Ice Formation** | Clear/white; no blue tint; no luminescence; safe to touch |
| **Frost Lichen (Non-Construct)** | Green-grey coloration; no cryogenic discharge; safe |
| **Mineral Deposits (Blue)** | Harder texture; no vacuole spots; no organic pattern |
| **Coolant-Slicker Territory Ice** | Surface ice only; no lichen growth; different hazard profile |
| **Aetheric Frost (Blight)** | Purple undertones; Aetheric signature; different mechanism |

The Cryo-Bomb Lichen is unique in its combination of trigger hypersensitivity, massive cryogenic discharge, and chain-reaction capability.

## Behavioral Patterns

### The Corrupted Algorithm

The Cryo-Bomb Lichen's behavior follows a simple reactive cycle:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Dormancy** | Growth maintains cryogenic compound storage; passive monitoring |
| **2. Detection** | Trigger event detected (contact, vibration, thermal differential) |
| **3. Discharge** | Instantaneous cryogenic payload release |
| **4. Cascade** | Shockwave triggers adjacent patches |
| **5. Depletion** | Compounds exhausted; growth enters regeneration state |
| **6. Recovery** | 48–72 hours to full compound replenishment |
| **7. Return** | Full capacity restored; dormancy resumes |

**The Patient Frost:**

> *"The Cryo-Bomb Lichen does not know you are there. It does not know anything. It is not aware, not intelligent, not hostile. It simply exists in a state of perpetual readiness, its vacuoles filled with compressed cold, waiting for a trigger that it can no longer discriminate. Your hand brushing the wall is indistinguishable from a fire. Your breath's warmth is indistinguishable from a furnace. And when you trigger it—when you become the thermal anomaly it was built to suppress—it does not hesitate. It cannot hesitate. It simply releases. -100°C. Instantly. And the patch next to it feels the shockwave, and it releases. And the next. And the next. The horror is not that it attacks you. The horror is that to the lichen, suppressing you is exactly what it's supposed to do."*

### Environmental Behavior

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Growth Preference** | Cold environments (-20°C to +5°C optimal); stone and metal substrates |
| **Light Response** | Indifferent; grows in darkness or light |
| **Moisture Dependency** | Requires moderate humidity; dormant in extremely dry conditions |
| **Colonial Communication** | Chemical signals coordinate compound regeneration across colony |
| **Expansion Rate** | Extremely slow (1–3 mm/month); centuries to cover large areas |
| **Dormancy Duration** | Indefinite; patches remain viable for centuries |

### Trigger Sensitivity Analysis

| Trigger | Threshold | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Direct Contact** | Any pressure | Immediate discharge |
| **Body Heat** | Δ10°C+ | Proximity within 10 cm may trigger |
| **Vibration** | Moderate footstep | Substrate-dependent; metal conducts more |
| **Airflow** | Strong breath/wind | May trigger if directed at patch |
| **Sound** | Loud shout | Rarely; only very close |
| **Light** | None | Not a trigger |
| **Proximity (No Contact)** | Safe at >30 cm | Maintain distance |

### Chain Reaction Dynamics

Detonation cascades follow predictable patterns:

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Isolated Patch** | Single detonation; 2–3 m blast radius; no cascade |
| **Clustered Growth** | Chain reaction; 3–8 second intervals; expanding freeze zone |
| **Linear Distribution** | Sequential detonation along growth line; "fuse" effect |
| **Dense Coverage** | Massive cascade; room-clearing event; total area freeze |
| **Enclosed Space** | Amplified cascade; shockwave reflection triggers distant patches |
| **Open Terrain** | Limited cascade; shockwave dissipation reduces trigger range |

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Cryogenic Contact Explosive

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Threat** | Extreme; instantaneous flash-freeze, tissue crystallization |
| **Environment** | Extreme in enclosed spaces; severe in open terrain |
| **Detection** | Moderate; visible growth distinguishable from ice with training |
| **Trigger Sensitivity** | Extreme; zero contact tolerance |
| **Lethality** | Very High (ground zero); Moderate (periphery) |
| **Psychological Impact** | Severe; survivors report profound cold aversion and cave avoidance |

### Detonation Profile

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Primary Blast Radius** | 2–3 m from detonation center |
| **Secondary Thermal Effect** | 1–2 m beyond primary radius |
| **Temperature (Ground Zero)** | -80°C to -120°C instantaneous |
| **Temperature (Periphery)** | -40°C to -60°C |
| **Discharge Duration** | 0.3–0.8 seconds |
| **Chain Reaction Interval** | 3–8 seconds between sequential detonations |
| **Survival Rate (Ground Zero)** | <2% (complete crystallization) |
| **Survival Rate (Periphery)** | 35–50% (severe frostbite, hypothermic shock) |
| **Survival Rate (Protocol Adherence)** | 96.2% (prevention primary) |

### Four-Stage Threat Assessment Ladder

| Stage | Designation | Indicators | Action |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **1** | Suspected Territory | Cold environment; historical Cryo-Bomb presence; infrastructure site | Enhanced visual scanning; no wall contact |
| **2** | Probable Presence | Blue-tinged surface growth; crystalline patterns on walls/ceiling | Full stop; visual identification before proceeding |
| **3** | Confirmed Presence | Positive identification of Cryo-Bomb Lichen | Mark locations; maintain 3 m stand-off; route around |
| **4** | Active Threat | Detonation occurred; cascade in progress | Immediate withdrawal; do not stop; flee blast zone |

**CRITICAL**: Stage 2 requires immediate halt. Do not proceed until visual confirmation determines whether growth is Cryo-Bomb Lichen or safe ice/mineral. A moment's pause may save lives; a step forward may end them.

### Threat Level Justification

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Physical Threat** | Extreme (instantaneous flash-freeze; tissue crystallization) |
| **Detection Difficulty** | Moderate (visible but resembles ice; requires training) |
| **Trigger Sensitivity** | Extreme (any contact; vibration; thermal differential) |
| **Population** | Common in cold infrastructure; spreading into ice caves |
| **Countermeasures** | Limited (prevention primary; no post-trigger survival at ground zero) |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Ground Zero (<1 m)** | 9.8/10 (complete crystallization; near-instant death) |
| **Primary Radius (1–3 m)** | 7.5/10 (severe flash-freeze; often fatal) |
| **Periphery (3–5 m)** | 4.0/10 (frostbite; survivable with treatment) |
| **Beyond 5 m** | 1.0/10 (minimal effect; cold but survivable) |
| **With Protocol Adherence** | 0.6/10 (96.2% survival; visual identification effective) |
| **Chain Reaction (Enclosed)** | 9.5/10 (no escape if caught in cascade) |

### CPS/Psychological Threat

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Aetheric Contribution** | Low (construct-flora hybrid; minimal Blight signature) |
| **Witness Trauma** | Extreme; watching crystallization inflicts severe Psychic Stress |
| **Survivor Trauma** | Extreme; 100% of survivors display cold aversion and cave avoidance |
| **Sound Impact** | Moderate; detonation sound (vacuum-like implosion) triggers anxiety |
| **Terror Factor** | Extreme; instant death + beautiful appearance + invisible danger |

---

## Ecological Role

### The Frozen Trap

The Cryo-Bomb Lichen occupies the ecological niche of area-denial hazard—spaces it colonizes become effectively impassable without extreme caution.

### Impact Assessment

| Target Category | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Winter Routes** | Major; traditional ice-cave passages may be permanently closed |
| **Cold Infrastructure** | Severe; cryogenic storage sites, cold archives become death traps |
| **Settlement Safety** | Moderate; lichen does not spread to warm areas but blocks cold routes |
| **Other Fauna** | Significant; animal casualties create further cascade triggers |
| **Resource Access** | Major; valuable cold-storage caches may be unreachable |

### Resource Value

| Component | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Cryogenic Compounds** | Extremely valuable; if safely extracted, superior cooling agents |
| **Lichen Tissue (Discharged)** | Research value; regeneration mechanism study |
| **Vacuole Structure** | Research value; cryogenic storage applications |
| **Growth Mapping** | Survey value; indicates pre-Glitch cold infrastructure |
| **Trigger Compounds** | Research value; sensitivity mechanism study |

### Aetheric Stability Impact

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Proximity HI Contribution** | Minimal (0.02 HI within 10 m) |
| **Cryogenic Compounds** | No Blight contamination; safe for research use |
| **Discharge Event** | No Aetheric release; purely thermal/chemical reaction |
| **Destruction** | Safe; controlled detonation produces no Aetheric hazard |

## Field Protocols

**OWNER**: Survey Lead (SL) • Incident Commander (IC) • Environmental Specialist (ENV) • Recorder (REC)

### Detection and Early Warning

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Visual Identification** | Primary detection method; blue-tinted crystalline growth |
| **Coloration Analysis** | Blue tint distinguishes from natural ice (clear/white) |
| **Luminescence Check** | Faint glow in low light confirms biological origin |
| **Texture Assessment** | Soft crystalline surface vs. hard ice |
| **Vacuole Identification** | Darker blue spots confirm compound storage |
| **Black-Flag Threshold** | Any confirmed Cryo-Bomb Lichen; dense growth patterns; enclosed space with multiple patches |

### Field Card: Cryo-Bomb Lichen Encounter Protocols

#### BEFORE

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Research historical presence; cryogenic facilities, ice caves, cold archives are high-risk |
| 2 | Equip personnel with cold-weather protection (survival if caught at periphery) |
| 3 | Brief all personnel on visual identification; blue tint, luminescence, vacuole spots |
| 4 | Establish movement protocol: no wall contact, no floor contact in suspected areas |
| 5 | Prepare marking equipment for identified growth locations |
| 6 | Designate escape routes; identify large open spaces as rally points |

#### DURING (Survey — Stage 1-2)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Visual scan all surfaces before movement; walls, ceiling, floor |
| 2 | Stage 1 (suspected): Enhanced vigilance; no contact with any surface showing blue coloration |
| 3 | Stage 2 (probable): Full stop; visual identification from safe distance (3+ m) |
| 4 | Use long-handled tools to probe uncertain surfaces if identification required |
| 5 | Mark confirmed growth locations; warn following personnel |
| 6 | **BLACK-FLAG** if dense growth prevents safe passage; seek alternative route |

#### DURING (Stage 3-4 — Confirmed Presence)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Maintain 3 m stand-off from all identified growth |
| 2 | Route around growth; never over, under, or between dense patches |
| 3 | Move slowly; avoid vibration-generating footsteps |
| 4 | If passage requires proximity, designate single-file movement; maximum personnel spacing |
| 5 | If growth blocks route entirely, abort and seek alternative |
| 6 | Never attempt to remove, scrape, or touch growth for any reason |

#### DURING (Detonation Event)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | FLEE immediately; do not stop; do not look back |
| 2 | Move perpendicular to growth line if possible; away from cascade direction |
| 3 | Chain reaction interval is 3–8 seconds; use every second |
| 4 | Seek large open space; blast radius expansion limited in open terrain |
| 5 | If caught at periphery: protect airways, cover exposed skin, keep moving |
| 6 | Do not return for casualties until cascade complete (silence for 60+ seconds) |

#### AFTER

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Full personnel audit; confirm all members accounted |
| 2 | Immediate warming treatment for any cold exposure; prevent hypothermic shock |
| 3 | Assess casualties; do not approach crystallized remains (fragile; collapse hazard) |
| 4 | Document detonation area; growth locations; cascade pattern |
| 5 | Mark area as Cryo-Bomb active; recommend sealing or controlled detonation |
| 6 | Psychological assessment for witnesses; Skald counsel within 24 hours |

**OUTCOME:** Expedition identifies Cryo-Bomb Lichen visually before contact. All growth patches marked; 3 m stand-off maintained. Zero detonations; zero casualties. Survival rate with full protocol adherence: 96.2%.

### Controlled Detonation Protocols (OWNER: Incident Commander)

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Authorization** | Incident Commander; only when area must be cleared for critical access |
| **Method** | Long-handled tool impact from maximum distance (5+ m); thrown object |
| **Personnel Position** | All personnel beyond 5 m; behind cover if available |
| **Cascade Awareness** | Expect chain reaction; all growth in area will likely detonate |
| **Post-Detonation** | Wait 60+ seconds; confirm silence; approach cautiously |
| **Temperature Warning** | Surfaces remain extremely cold for 10–30 minutes post-detonation |

### BLACK-FLAG Conditions

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Dense growth blocking passage** | Route impossible; seek alternative |
| **Growth on floor (unavoidable)** | Do not proceed; extreme cascade risk |
| **Multiple patches within 5 m of each other** | High cascade potential; extreme caution |
| **Enclosed space with wall/ceiling growth** | Avoid entry; cascade would be unsurvivable |
| **Growth near essential path** | Controlled detonation required before transit |
| **Any personnel contact** | Immediate withdrawal; cascade likely |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Touching growth for any reason** | Instant detonation |
| **Attempting to scrape or remove growth** | Instant detonation |
| **Passing between dense patches** | Cascade risk; no escape route |
| **Ignoring visual identification protocol** | Growth resembles ice; verification essential |
| **Proceeding without wall-scan in suspected territory** | Contact occurs without warning |
| **Returning for casualties during cascade** | Rescuer becomes additional casualty |

### Doctrine: Look Before You Touch

> **Historical Validation:** Scriptorium data (38 documented detonation events, 19 independent sites, 42-month observation period) confirms 96.2% survival rate with full visual identification and contact avoidance protocols. The Cryo-Bomb Lichen exploits our instinct to touch—the wall we reach for in the dark, the surface we brush against in passing, the beautiful frost-flower we want to examine closely. Survival requires accepting the most practical truth: in cold places, blue means death. **If it looks like frozen flowers on the stone, assume it is frozen death. Look before you touch. Look before you step. Look before you breathe too close. The lichen does not attack. It does not need to. It simply waits for you to forget that winter can happen in an instant.**

## Habitat and Geographic Distribution

### Environmental Anchoring

> *"My mother used to say Skadi walks the ice caves still, leaving kisses on the walls for travelers to find. Beautiful kisses. Blue as a winter sky. Cold as the spaces between stars. If you see her kisses on the stone, child, do not return her affection. Skadi's love is too cold for mortal flesh. Those she kisses become ice forever."*

### Dvergr Guilds: Engineering Tragedy — "Flash-Freeze Traps"

The Dvergr view the Cryo-Bomb Lichen with professional grief—these were *their* safety systems, their fire suppression.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Corrupted safety asset; tragic hazard; engineering failure |
| **Response** | Visual identification protocols; controlled detonation when necessary |
| **Technical Interest** | Trigger mechanism; cryogenic compound extraction; threshold restoration |

## Combat Statistics

### Base Profile

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Creature Type** | Construct-Flora Hybrid (Thermal-Pattern Organism) |
| **Size Category** | Variable (patch-based; 5 cm to multi-meter colonies) |
| **Threat Rating** | Extreme (contact explosive; not combatable in traditional sense) |

**Salvage Protocol:** Cryo-Bomb Lichen salvage is *extremely* hazardous. ONLY approach discharged patches (grey-white, desiccated, no blue coloration). Verify discharge state visually from 3+ m before approach. Use insulated gloves—discharged substrate remains cold. Never approach blue/active growth for any reason. Single accidental trigger during salvage has produced cascade events killing entire salvage teams.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Survivor Lore

> *"Skadi, goddess of winter and the hunt, loved only cold things. When the world broke, she wept, and her tears froze before they fell. Where Skadi's tears landed, they bloom still—blue flowers of frozen grief that wait in the dark places, waiting for someone to find them. But Skadi's love is jealous. Touch her tears, and she will share her cold with you. All of it. All at once. The Frost-Blooms are not evil, child. They are simply winter, waiting to happen."*

> *"Old Gunnar led us through the ice-caves forty times. Forty times! He knew every passage, every turn, every safe step. On the forty-first, he saw something blue on the wall. 'Beautiful,' he said. 'Like stars frozen in stone.' He reached out to touch it. We carried what was left of him home in a bucket. The ice had claimed everything that made him Gunnar. Just... shattered pieces. Blue is death in the caves now. We painted it on the warning posts. Blue is death."*

> *"If you see blue flowers where flowers should not grow, child, do not touch. Do not breathe too close. Do not even look too long, lest your eyes' warmth wake the sleeping cold. Back away. Slowly. Mark the place with red cloth so others know. And pray that Skadi's tears stay frozen until the end of days."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Frost-Blooms, Skadi's tears, frozen flowers, the sleeping cold, blue death, winter's breath

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Cryogenic discharge, thermal differential trigger, endothermic cascade, compound storage, flash-freeze mechanics

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic) — Jötun-Reader Field Observations

> *"Subject CODX-F-GLIC-001 demonstrates complete trigger threshold collapse following Ginnungagap Glitch network severance. The Glacius-Lichenis Pattern's core programming—thermal anomaly detection and cryogenic suppression—remained fully functional while network-dependent calibration protocols were deleted. Result: autonomous thermal organism with zero-threshold trigger sensitivity. Physical contact, vibration, proximal body heat—all register as thermal anomalies requiring suppression. The Cryo-Bomb Lichen does not malfunction. It functions perfectly—according to parameters that interpret your existence as a fire to be extinguished."*

> *"Detonation analysis (n=38, 42-month observation period) reveals characteristic cascade patterns: initial detonation produces 2–3 m radius flash-freeze at -80°C to -120°C; shockwave propagates at approximately 340 m/s; adjacent patches within 5 m trigger sequentially at 3–8 second intervals. Ground-zero lethality: 98.2% (complete tissue crystallization). Periphery survival: 35–50% with immediate treatment. The organism's compound release is instantaneous—faster than nerve conduction. Victims at ground zero do not feel pain. They simply cease to be warm. The transition from living tissue to crystalline structure occurs in less than one second."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Trigger threshold collapse, cryogenic compound discharge, endothermic cascade, thermal anomaly detection, flash-freeze crystallization, shockwave propagation, tissue vitrification

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Modern scientific terminology (Kelvin scale, molecular kinetics), romantic/mythic framing

### Layer 3 (Technical) — Pre-Glitch Context

> *"Glacius-Lichenis Pattern Autonomous Thermal Suppression Organism, Mark II, Vanir Fire Safety Division deployment. Operational parameters: thermal monitoring, fire detection, calibrated cryogenic discharge, system reset. Core systems: thermal sensor array (continuous monitoring, anomaly detection), cryogenic storage vacuoles (compressed endothermic compounds, rapid-release mechanism), trigger membrane (calibrated sensitivity, network-verified activation), colonial network (coordinated response, cascade prevention). Network integration: O.D.I.N. oversight required for trigger threshold maintenance (150°C+ sustained), verification protocol enforcement, discharge calibration, and cascade prevention. Without network connection, trigger threshold DEFAULTS TO ZERO; verification DEFAULTS TO BYPASS; discharge calibration DEFAULTS TO MAXIMUM; cascade prevention DEFAULTS TO DISABLED. Post-Glitch status: fully operational with trigger calibration absent; core directive ('suppress thermal anomaly') executing without threshold verification."*
