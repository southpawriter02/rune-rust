## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Spiritual Attunement I is the Seiðkona's **defining perception passive**—the awakened sight that allows them to perceive psychic echoes, residual memories, and the presence of the Forlorn. This establishes their identity as the party's spiritual sensor and information gatherer.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Detect Forlorn, psychic echoes, and hidden spiritual phenomena
- **Secondary:** Grant passive bonus to Psychic defense
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The opened third eye that sees beyond the material

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Moderate (utility + defensive)
- **Always Active:** No resource cost for passive benefits
- **Information Advantage:** Detection provides tactical knowledge
- **Defensive Bonus:** Psychic defense helps survival

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Seiðkona closes their eyes and *sees*. Not with mortal vision, but with the sight that the old völvas called the **Inner Eye**—the perception that pierces the veil between worlds and glimpses what lingers in the spaces between.

They see the **echoes**: residual memories imprinted on objects, emotional trauma staining the walls of ruined homes, the flickering presence of the Forlorn—those spirits too broken to move on, too stubborn to fade. Where others see only ruins, the Seiðkona sees a tapestry of the dead.

### Thematic Resonance

This is the fundamental gift of the Seiðkona path: the ability to commune with what others cannot perceive. It is both blessing and burden—to see the dead is to never truly be alone, but also to never truly be at peace.
