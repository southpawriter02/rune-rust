# Data Capture Types — Codex Fragment Classification System

---

## Overview

**Data Captures** are the evidentiary fragments that accompany Codex entries. Each fragment represents a discrete piece of recovered knowledge, classified by acquisition method and source type. These 50 canonical types provide the taxonomic framework for all Aethelgard Archival Material.

When building Codex entries, each Data Capture fragment should be assigned one of the types below. This ensures consistent categorization across the Archives and enables proper voice layer application.

## Voice Layer Mapping

Each Data Capture type aligns with specific voice layers as defined in the AAM Style Guide:

| Type Category | Primary Voice Layer | Notes |
|---------------|---------------------|-------|
| Written Records (1-6) | L2 Scholarly | Clinical, diagnostic perspective; epistemic uncertainty |
| Oral Traditions (7-12) | L1 Mythic/Dialectal | Preserves folk voice, oral cadence, no precision measurements |
| Physical Evidence (13-18) | L2/L3 Clinical | Technical analysis; measurement-adjacent but Domain 4 compliant |
| Sensory Media (19-24) | L1/L3 Hybrid | Often corrupted; echo-layer contamination permitted |
| Institutional (25-28) | L2 Scholarly | Formal institutional voice; bureaucratic precision |
| Esoteric (29-30) | L1 Mythic | Prophetic, ambiguous; unreliable narrator permitted |
| Architectural (31-34) | L2/L3 Technical | Structural analysis; environmental observation |

## Usage Guidelines

### When Creating New Data Captures

1. **Select the appropriate type** from the 30 canonical categories
2. **Assign a unique Capture ID** following the naming convention
3. **Apply the correct voice layer** based on the type category
4. **Ensure Domain 4 compliance** for all POST-Glitch content
5. **Document the placement context** for in-game discovery
