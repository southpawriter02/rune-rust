## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Scholarly Acumen I is the Jötun-Reader's **foundational knowledge passive**—the rigorous academic discipline that forms the core of their identity. Their mind is a finely honed analytical instrument, a living library of forgotten history and complex schematics.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Grant +2 bonus dice to WITS-based investigation/lore checks
- **Secondary:** Bonus applies to hacking, deciphering, and lore recall
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The educated mind that sees patterns others miss

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High (broad utility bonus)
- **Non-Combat Focus:** Primary benefit in exploration/investigation
- **Always Active:** No resource cost for passive benefits

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Jötun-Reader's mind is not just sharp—it is a **finely honed analytical instrument**. Years of studying corrupted data-logs, translating runic fragments, and cross-referencing pre-crash schematics have created a scholar whose natural talent for academic rigor and deductive reasoning surpasses all others.

When they examine an artifact, they see layers of meaning invisible to untrained eyes. When they study a mechanism, they recognize design principles from a dozen different Old World engineering traditions.

### Thematic Resonance

Scholarly Acumen establishes the Jötun-Reader as the party's premier intellectual—proof that knowledge is the most powerful tool in a broken world.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Knowledge Bonus

**Passive Effect:**

- +2 bonus dice to all WITS-based checks for:
    - Investigating lore (deciphering data-logs, runic carvings, artifacts)
    - System Bypass (hacking terminals)
    - Lore recall (dialogue checks flagged as [WITS - Lore])

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Trigger:** Character attempts qualifying WITS-based check
2. **Passive Check:** Does character have Scholarly Acumen I?
3. **Bonus Application:** If yes, add +2 dice to pool
4. **Roll Resolution:** Proceed with enhanced dice pool

---

## IV. Progression Path

### Rank 1 (Base — This Ability)

- +2 dice to qualifying WITS-based checks

### Rank 2 (Expert — 20 PP)

- +4 dice to qualifying WITS-based checks
- **New:** Also applies to Perception checks when searching for hidden lore

### Rank 3 (Mastery — Capstone)

- +4 dice to qualifying checks
- **New:** On any `investigate` check to decipher lore, standard Success automatically upgraded to Critical Success
- **New:** First successful lore discovery each session grants +5 temporary HP to party

---

## V. Tactical Applications

1. **Puzzle Solving:** Massive advantage on Logic-Loop and Data Corruption puzzles
2. **Terminal Hacking:** Significant bonus to System Bypass checks
3. **Lore Discovery:** Find hidden information others would miss
4. **Dialogue:** Excel in knowledge-based conversation checks
5. **Party Utility:** Translate and explain findings to allies

---

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **High WITS builds:** Massive dice pools for knowledge checks
- **Analyze Weakness:** Lore discoveries inform tactical analysis
- **Runic Linguistics:** Combined for complete translation capability
- **Exploration-heavy campaigns:** Maximum value in ruin-delving

### Negative Synergies

- **Combat focus:** No direct combat benefit
- **Low-WITS builds:** Less value without base attribute investment
