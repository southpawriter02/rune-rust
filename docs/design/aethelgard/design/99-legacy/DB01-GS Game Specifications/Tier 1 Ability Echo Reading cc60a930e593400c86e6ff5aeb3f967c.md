## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Echo Reading is the Seiðkona's **signature divination ability**—the power to extract psychic impressions from objects, locations, and remains. This is their primary information-gathering tool and establishes their "psychic archaeologist" identity.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Extract narrative information from psychic echoes
- **Secondary:** Reveal mechanical information (enemy weaknesses, hidden paths)
- **Self-Cost:** Small Psychic Stress (witnessing trauma costs sanity)
- **Fantasy Delivery:** Reading the memories imprinted on the world

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High utility (information is power)
- **Narrative Integration:** GM provides information based on target significance
- **Psychic Cost:** Prevents spam; reading trauma affects reader
- **Non-Combat Focus:** Primary utility outside of combat

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Seiðkona places their hands on the rusted blade and **opens their mind**. The metal is cold, but beneath the cold is *heat*—the echo of the forge, the rage of the battle, the terror of the final cut. Images flood through them: a warrior's face twisted in fury, a spray of blood across snow, the sound of a body hitting the ground.

They pull back, gasping. Their nose bleeds, just a little. The blade has told its story, and stories have weight.

### Thematic Resonance

Echo Reading is the Seiðkona as psychic archaeologist—literally excavating the past from the objects and places that witnessed it. Every reading is an act of exhumation, and exhumation always has a cost.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Activation

- **Action Type:** Standard Action (or 1 minute outside combat)
- **Cost:** 30 AP + **Small Psychic Stress** (3-5)
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Single object, location (3m radius), or corpse

### Effect

**Extract psychic information based on target:**

| Target Type | Information Type |
| --- | --- |
| Object | Last significant event involving the object; emotional context |
| Location | Most traumatic/significant event in area; who was present |
| Corpse | Cause of death; final moments; killer's identity (if significant) |
| Creature remains | Weaknesses of that creature type; behavioral patterns |

### Information Quality

- **Base:** General impressions, emotional context, vague imagery
- **Strong Echo:** Clearer details, specific names/faces, tactical information
- **Weak/Faded Echo:** Fragmentary impressions, ambiguous details

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Touch Target:** Seiðkona makes physical contact
2. **Cost Payment:** Spend 30 AP; gain Small Psychic Stress
3. **Echo Check:** GM determines echo strength based on target significance
4. **Information Delivery:** Seiðkona receives psychic impression
5. **Interpretation:** Player interprets/relays information to party
