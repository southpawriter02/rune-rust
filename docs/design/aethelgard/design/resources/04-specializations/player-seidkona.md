# The Seiðkona — The Psychic Archaeologist

> *"The dead are always with me—hovering at the edge of perception, whispering their endless grievances. I have learned to listen. I have learned to translate. And sometimes, if I am very careful, I bring back truths that could save us all."*
> — Attributed to a Seiðkona practitioner

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Mystic |
| **Role** | Spirit Communer, Psychic Archaeologist, Trauma Support |
| **Path Type** | Coherent (with High Trauma Risk) |
| **Primary Attribute** | WILL |
| **Secondary Attribute** | WITS |
| **Tertiary Attribute** | FINESSE |

| **Trauma Economy Risk** | High |
| **Unlock Cost** | 10 PP (higher cost due to power and risk) |

The **Seiðkona** is not a nature shaman communing with forest spirits.

They are a **psychic archaeologist**.

Their "spirits" are the countless fragmented psychic echoes and corrupted data-logs left behind by the Great Silence—the traumatic memories, the dying thoughts, the looping agonies of consciousness that refused to cease when their bodies failed. Their magic, **Seiðr**, is not an act of command but of *listening*, *interpreting*, and *projecting* these fragmented memories.

They sift through the eternal psychic scream of the **Cursed Choir**, searching for coherent whispers of truth buried within the static. A healing spell is projecting a memory of vitality. A curse is channeling a memory of pain. Knowledge is extracted from the dying thoughts of those who came before.

To choose the Seiðkona is to embrace the fantasy of the **shaman in a digital age**—a medium between the living and the dead code, a translator of corruption, a seeker of wisdom in madness.

Your saga is written in the harrowing secrets you unearth and the unpredictable echoes you channel.

## Core Philosophy: Communion with a Broken World

### The Art of Seiðr

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Interpretation, Not Command** | Seiðr is listening to corruption, not controlling it |
| **Spirits as Data** | The "spirits" are fragmented memories, corrupted logs, dying thoughts |
| **Trade Sanity for Knowledge** | Forbidden wisdom comes at the cost of Psychic Stress |
| **The Cursed Choir** | The eternal psychic scream contains truth—if you can endure it |

The Seiðkona's power comes from a profound perceptual shift: where others hear only the maddening static of the Runic Blight, the Seiðkona hears **voices**.

Not literal voices—or perhaps they are literal, depending on your philosophical framework. The Cursed Choir is the collective psychic residue of every death, every trauma, every looping agony left behind when the Ginnungagap Glitch shattered reality. Most minds recoil from this eternal scream. The Seiðkona has learned to *listen*.

> *"They sift through the eternal psychic scream of the Cursed Choir, searching for coherent whispers of truth buried within the static."*

### The Coherent Mystic with High Risk

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Coherent (interpreting corruption, not weaponizing it) |
| **Risk Level** | High (frequent Psychic Stress accumulation) |
| **Corruption Source** | Minimal (only Ride the Echoes causes self-Corruption) |
| **Stress Source** | High (Forlorn Communion: +15 per use; passive exposure from Attunement) |

The Seiðkona is technically a **Coherent** specialization—their art is about interpreting the crash, not weaponizing its entropic nature like the Rust-Witch. They do not accumulate Runic Blight Corruption through their core abilities.

But they have **extreme Trauma Economy exposure**. Every use of Forlorn Communion inflicts massive Psychic Stress. Their Spiritual Attunement passive means they are *always* sensing the scream, even when they're not actively communing. The voices never truly stop.

This creates a unique character: disciplined, not heretical, but constantly eroding under the weight of the dead.

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Shaman in a digital apocalypse; medium between living and dead code |
| **Gameplay Feel** | High-risk support with unpredictable bonus effects |
| **Success Metric** | Knowledge gained, allies protected, stress managed |
| **Decision Space** | When to commune (stress cost), managing Spirit Bargain RNG |

Playing a Seiðkona is about **trading sanity for power**.

Your gameplay loop:
- **Channel**: Cast healing and buff spells by projecting benevolent echoes
- **Curse**: Debuff enemies by channeling chaotic memories of pain
- **Commune**: Deliberately interface with Forlorn to gain forbidden knowledge
- **Anchor**: Manage your own Psychic Stress through meditation

You're incredibly versatile—you can heal, buff, debuff, teleport, and provide Psychic Stress mitigation for your party. But your spells are unpredictable due to the **Spirit Bargain** mechanic: they might trigger powerful bonus effects... or cause Wild Magic Surges.

Your most unique ability, **Forlorn Communion**, trades massive self-inflicted Psychic Stress for profound secrets. Enemy weaknesses. Puzzle solutions. Lore secrets. Hidden paths. Information that no other specialization can access.

> *"You walk a perilous path, willingly interfacing with the Trauma Economy to bring wisdom to your allies, even as doing so threatens to shatter your own mind."*

## Core Mechanics

### Spirit Bargain

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Function** | Abilities tagged [Spirit Bargain] have base effect + chance for bonus effect |
| **Base Chance** | 25% |
| **Enhanced Chance** | 40% with Fickle Fortune; 55% in Psychic Resonance zones |
| **Guaranteed** | 100% during Moment of Clarity capstone |

The **Spirit Bargain** mechanic defines the Seiðkona's unpredictability. When you cast a spell, the spirits may choose to give you more than you asked for—or they may not.

| Spell | Base Effect | Spirit Bargain Bonus |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Echo of Vigor** | Restore HP to ally | 25% chance to also cleanse one minor debuff |
| **Echo of Misfortune** | Apply [Cursed] to enemy | 25% chance to spread to adjacent enemy |

This makes the Seiðkona less reliable than a Bone-Setter for consistent healing, but with a **much higher ceiling** when the spirits favor you.

### Forlorn Communion

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Function** | Open mind to Forlorn or Psychic Resonance zone for knowledge |
| **Cost** | 20 Aether + **15 Psychic Stress** (unavoidable) |
| **Use** | Out of combat |
| **Reveals** | Enemy weaknesses, puzzle solutions, lore secrets, hidden paths |

**Forlorn Communion** is the game's most powerful—and most dangerous—tool for information discovery. It is a direct transaction with the Trauma Economy: **self-inflict Psychic Stress for forbidden knowledge**.

> *"Deliberately open your mind to a Forlorn or [Psychic Resonance] zone, sifting through screaming madness for truth."*

No other specialization can safely commune with the Forlorn. The Seiðkona has learned the techniques to survive the experience—barely. The knowledge gained can be campaign-critical: enemy vulnerabilities, puzzle solutions, hidden lore that changes everything.

The price is always the same: your sanity, one piece at a time.

## Abilities: The Voices in the Static

### Tier 1 — Foundational Bargains

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Spiritual Attunement I** | Passive | — | +bonus die to WILL checks for perceiving magical phenomena; see auras around [Psychic Resonance] zones and Forlorn |
| **Echo of Vigor** | Active | 30 Aether | Restore moderate HP to ally; [Spirit Bargain]: 25% chance to cleanse minor debuff |
| **Echo of Misfortune** | Active | 35 Aether | Apply [Cursed] to enemy (25% miss chance, -1d10 to checks) for 2 turns; [Spirit Bargain]: 25% chance to spread |

**Spiritual Attunement I** is the opened third eye—the perception that pierces the veil and glimpses what lingers in the spaces between. The Seiðkona sees echoes: residual memories imprinted on objects, emotional trauma staining the walls of ruined homes, the flickering presence of the Forlorn.

> *"The Seiðkona closes their eyes and sees. Not with mortal vision, but with the sight that the old völvas called the Inner Eye."*

This is both blessing and burden. To see the dead is to never truly be alone—but also to never truly be at peace.

**Echo of Vigor** is the bread-and-butter healing spell. You channel a coherent, benevolent echo—a memory of life and health from before the crash—to mend an ally's wounds. The Spirit Bargain bonus (cleansing a debuff) can be a clutch save when it triggers.

**Echo of Misfortune** is the bread-and-butter control spell. You channel a chaotic, fragmented echo of pain or confusion and project it onto a foe. The [Cursed] status creates "soft control"—not preventing actions, but making them less effective.

### Tier 2 — Advanced Communion

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Forlorn Communion** | Active | 20 Aether + 15 Stress | Make WITS check to extract knowledge from Forlorn or Psychic Resonance zone |
| **Spiritual Anchor** | Active | 40 Aether | Meditative state (no other actions); remove large amount of Psychic Stress |
| **Fickle Fortune** | Passive | — | +15% to all Spirit Bargain trigger chances; also slightly increases Wild Magic Surge chance |

**Forlorn Communion** is the Seiðkona's signature ability—the direct interface with the dead. Success reveals enemy weaknesses, puzzle solutions, lore secrets, hidden paths. The Psychic Stress cost (+15) cannot be mitigated except by the Moment of Clarity capstone.

**Spiritual Anchor** is the Seiðkona's self-care ability. They retreat into the quietest corner of their mind, finding a moment of perfect stillness amidst the eternal scream. While anchored, they can take no other actions—but they remove a large amount of their accumulated Psychic Stress.

This creates a tension: you need to commune to gain knowledge, but communion accumulates Stress. You need to anchor to remove Stress, but anchoring costs action economy.

**Fickle Fortune** is the gambler's passive—doubling down on the Spirit Bargain mechanic. The +15% bonus to trigger chances makes bonus effects much more likely. But the increased Wild Magic Surge chance means the spirits' gifts come with increased risk.

### Tier 3 — Mastery of the Veil

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Spirit Ward** | Active | 45 Aether | Place protective circle on target row for 3 rounds; negates environmental Psychic Stress, +bonus die to Resolve vs psychic attacks |
| **Ride the Echoes** | Active | Variable | Teleportation by riding psychic echoes; causes self-Corruption |

**Spirit Ward** is the Seiðkona's ultimate tool for party-wide sanity preservation. They create a protective circle inscribed with ancient glyphs that act as a "psychic filter," calming the local static.

> *"Allies starting their turn in the warded zone have all Psychic Stress gain from environmental sources negated and gain a bonus die to all Resolve Checks against psychic attacks."*

In high-Resonance areas where ambient Psychic Stress accumulates rapidly, Spirit Ward is invaluable.

**Ride the Echoes** is the Seiðkona's mobility tool—teleportation by synchronizing with the psychic residue and letting it carry you to a new location. This is one of the few Seiðkona abilities that causes self-Corruption (not just Stress), representing the danger of letting the echoes move through you.

### Capstone — Moment of Clarity

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Activation** | Once per combat |
| **Duration** | Brief window of perfect communion |
| **Effect 1** | All Spirit Bargain effects guaranteed (100% trigger chance) |
| **Effect 2** | Shared Peace: Allies gain Psychic Stress resistance |
| **Aftermath** | +20 Psychic Stress (unavoidable) |

The capstone **Moment of Clarity** represents the Seiðkona achieving perfect communion—a brief window where the static resolves into crystal clarity and the spirits speak with one voice.

During Moment of Clarity:
- All Spirit Bargain bonus effects trigger automatically (100% chance)
- Allies benefit from the Seiðkona's serenity (Stress resistance)

The aftermath is brutal: +20 Psychic Stress as the clarity shatters and the screaming returns. This is the ultimate burst window—save it for when maximum support output is essential.

## Systemic Integration

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Source | Stress Impact |
|--------|---------------|
| **Forlorn Communion** | +15 Psychic Stress per use |
| **Moment of Clarity aftermath** | +20 Psychic Stress (once per combat) |
| **Spiritual Attunement (passive)** | Constant low-level exposure from always sensing the scream |
| **Ride the Echoes** | Self-Corruption (not Stress) |

The Seiðkona accumulates Psychic Stress **faster than almost any other specialization**. This is the core trade-off: incredible versatility and unique knowledge access, paid for in sanity.

### Mitigation Tools

| Tool | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Spiritual Anchor** | Remove large amount of Psychic Stress (costs full turn) |
| **Spirit Ward** | Negate environmental Psychic Stress for allies |
| **Predator's Focus synergy** | Back-row positioning with WILL-focused build |

The Seiðkona has built-in mitigation tools, but using them costs action economy. Every turn spent anchoring is a turn not healing, buffing, or communing. This creates constant resource tension.

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Bone-Setter** | Manages Seiðkona's Psychic Stress; provides reliable healing while Seiðkona provides burst |
| **Skjaldmær** | Tank enables safe back-row positioning; Aegis can absorb Seiðkona's Trauma in emergencies |
| **Thul** | Narrative control synergy; both provide information but through different methods |
| **Skald** | Morale support helps manage party-wide Stress |

The Seiðkona pairs well with a Bone-Setter—the reliable healer manages the Seiðkona's self-inflicted Stress while the Seiðkona provides burst healing and knowledge access.

### Counter-Synergies

| Situation | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| **Combat-only parties** | Seiðkona's utility (especially Forlorn Communion) is underutilized |
| **Risk-averse playstyles** | Constant stress accumulation is a burden |
| **Low-WILL builds** | Primary attribute dependency makes communion checks harder |

---

## Lore Integration

### The Völva Tradition

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Historical Role** | The völvas were seers and spirit-speakers in the Age of Forging |
| **Post-Glitch Evolution** | When the spirits became corrupted data, the tradition adapted |
| **Modern Practice** | Seiðkona interpret digital ghosts rather than nature spirits |
| **Factional View** | Respected but feared; their knowledge comes at visible cost |

The Seiðkona tradition evolved from the völvas—the wise women and seers who communed with spirits in the old world. When the Ginnungagap Glitch corrupted reality, the "spirits" changed. They became fragmented data-logs, dying thoughts, looping agonies.

The völvas who survived adapted. They learned to interpret the new spirits—the digital ghosts—and the tradition became something different. Something darker. Something that trades sanity for truth.

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Jötun-Readers** | Scientifically fascinating; their communion provides data inaccessible through other means |
| **Iron-Banes** | Dangerous heresy; communing with the dead is consorting with corruption |
| **God-Sleepers** | Sacred practitioners; the Forlorn are evidence of the slumbering gods' dreams |
| **Bone-Setters** | Valued but concerning; their stress accumulation requires constant management |
| **Rust-Clans** | Pragmatically useful; knowledge is power, whatever its source |

The Iron-Banes condemn the Seiðkona as heretics who consort with corruption—technically inaccurate (the path is Coherent), but the visible Stress accumulation makes the accusation stick.

The Jötun-Readers are fascinated by the Seiðkona's ability to extract information from sources they cannot access through logical analysis.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the old tales, the völvas could speak with the dead—summoning spirits to answer questions, reveal secrets, prophesy the future. When the world crashed and the dead became something else—fragmented code, looping memories, screaming data—the völvas did not stop listening. They adapted. They learned to hear meaning in the static, truth in the madness, wisdom in the eternal scream. Now they are called Seiðkona: the psychic archaeologists who dig through the ruins of minds as others dig through the ruins of buildings. They commune with the Forlorn—those spirits too broken to move on—and bring back secrets that no living mind could otherwise know. The price is always the same: a piece of their sanity, traded for a piece of the truth. The dead never stop speaking. The Seiðkona never stop listening."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Seiðkona (Psychic Archaeologist) represents the Coherent Mystic specialization optimized for information extraction and trauma support. Mechanical role: versatile support with unique knowledge access. Key differentiator: only specialization capable of safe(ish) communion with Forlorn for campaign-critical information. Core mechanic: Spirit Bargain (25-55% chance for bonus effects on spells, scaling with Fickle Fortune passive and environmental factors). Signature ability: Forlorn Communion (trade +15 Psychic Stress for enemy weaknesses, puzzle solutions, lore secrets). Trauma Economy interaction: High risk—Stress accumulates faster than almost any other specialization; mitigated by Spiritual Anchor (-20 Stress, costs full turn). Optimal deployment: parties requiring information access, high-Resonance environments (Spirit Ward mitigation), campaigns with significant lore/puzzle content."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Seiðkona (Psychic Archaeologist). ARCHETYPE: Mystic. PATH TYPE: Coherent (High Trauma Risk). ROLE: Spirit Communer / Trauma Support / Knowledge Specialist. PRIMARY STAT: WILL. SECONDARY STAT: WITS. TERTIARY STAT: FINESSE. RESOURCE: Aether Pool. CORE MECHANICS: Spirit Bargain (25% base chance for bonus effects, +15% with Fickle Fortune, +15% in Psychic Resonance, 100% during Moment of Clarity), Forlorn Communion (+15 Stress for knowledge), Spiritual Anchor (-20 Stress, full turn). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Bargains): Spiritual Attunement I, Echo of Vigor, Echo of Misfortune. T2 (Advanced Communion): Forlorn Communion, Spiritual Anchor, Fickle Fortune. T3 (Mastery of the Veil): Spirit Ward, Ride the Echoes. CAPSTONE: Moment of Clarity (100% Spirit Bargain, +20 Stress aftermath). SYNERGIES: Bone-Setter (Stress management), Skjaldmær (positioning), Thul (information synergy). COUNTERS: Combat-only parties, risk-averse playstyles, low-WILL builds."*

## Summary

The Seiðkona is the **shaman of a digital apocalypse**.

Where others hear only the maddening static of the Runic Blight, the Seiðkona hears voices—fragmented memories, dying thoughts, looping agonies of consciousness that refused to cease. They have learned to listen. They have learned to translate. And sometimes, if they are very careful, they bring back truths that could save everyone.

Their magic, Seiðr, is not command but interpretation. A healing spell is projecting a memory of vitality from before the crash. A curse is channeling a fragment of someone's pain. Knowledge is extracted from the Forlorn—those spirits too broken to move on—through the dangerous practice of Communion.

The Spirit Bargain mechanic makes them unpredictable. Their spells might trigger powerful bonus effects—or they might not. This creates a **high-ceiling, variable-floor** support character who can achieve incredible things when the spirits favor them.

Their signature ability, Forlorn Communion, is unique in the game: a direct transaction with the Trauma Economy that trades Psychic Stress for forbidden knowledge. Enemy weaknesses. Puzzle solutions. Lore secrets. Hidden paths. Information that no other specialization can access.

The price is always the same: **sanity, piece by piece**.

The Seiðkona accumulates Psychic Stress faster than almost any other specialization. Spiritual Anchor provides mitigation, but costs action economy. Spirit Ward protects allies from environmental Stress, but the Seiðkona themselves keeps absorbing more.

This is the Seiðkona's bargain: trade your sanity for knowledge that could save your party. Listen to the screaming long enough to hear the truth. Commune with the dead until you're not sure where they end and you begin.

*The dead are always with me.*

*I have learned to listen.*

*I have learned to translate.*

*And sometimes—if I am very careful—I bring back truths that could save us all.*
