## v0.0.6a: Multi-Monster Combat Foundation

[v0.0.6a Design Specification](v0.0.6a-design-specification.md)

### Overview
Transform single-monster encounters into multi-monster combat with target selection and initiative-based turn order. This phase establishes the core infrastructure for tactical combat.

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- Multiple monsters per room (already partially supported in Room entity)
- Target selection command (`attack <target>`, `attack goblin`, `attack 2`)
- Combat initiative system using dice rolls
- Turn order management
- Monster identification (numbering duplicate types: "Goblin 1", "Goblin 2")
- Combat state tracking (who's in combat, turn order, current turn)

**Out of Scope:**
- Monster AI behaviors (v0.0.6b)
- Fleeing combat (v0.0.6b)
- Status effects (v0.0.6c/d)

### Key Deliverables

| Type | Count | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| Domain Entities | 1 | `CombatEncounter` aggregate |
| Domain Value Objects | 2 | `InitiativeRoll`, `CombatantTurnOrder` |
| Domain Services | 1 | `InitiativeService` |
| Application Services | 1 | Update `GameSessionService` |
| Commands | 2 | Update `AttackCommand`, add targeting |
| DTOs | 3 | `CombatEncounterDto`, `InitiativeDto`, `CombatantDto` |
| Configuration | 1 | Initiative formula config |
| Unit Tests | ~20 | |

## v0.0.6b: Monster AI & Flee System

[v0.0.6b Design Specification](v0.0.6b-design-specification.md)

### Overview
Add intelligence to monster behavior with configurable AI patterns and give players the ability to flee from combat using skill checks.

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- Monster AI behavior system (Aggressive, Defensive, Cowardly, Support)
- AI decision making during monster turns
- Flee command with skill check
- Flee consequences (opportunity attacks, room exit)
- Combat log with scrollable history
- Combat round summaries

**Out of Scope:**
- Status effects (v0.0.6c/d)
- Complex AI strategies (pathfinding, group tactics)

### Key Deliverables

| Type | Count | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| Domain Enums | 1 | `AIBehavior` |
| Domain Services | 1 | `MonsterAIService` |
| Domain Value Objects | 2 | `AIDecision`, `FleeAttemptResult` |
| Commands | 1 | `FleeCommand` |
| Configuration | 1 | AI behavior definitions JSON |
| DTOs | 2 | `CombatLogEntryDto`, `AIDecisionDto` |
| Unit Tests | ~18 | |

### AI Behavior Types

```csharp
public enum AIBehavior
{
    /// <summary>Always attacks, prioritizes lowest HP target.</summary>
    Aggressive,

    /// <summary>Attacks if HP > 50%, otherwise defends/heals.</summary>
    Defensive,

    /// <summary>Flees when HP < 30%, attacks weakest otherwise.</summary>
    Cowardly,

    /// <summary>Heals/buffs allies, only attacks if alone.</summary>
    Support,

    /// <summary>Random actions, unpredictable.</summary>
    Chaotic,

    /// <summary>Custom behavior defined in configuration.</summary>
    Scripted
}
```

### AI Decision Logic

```
AGGRESSIVE:
  1. Always attack
  2. Target: Lowest HP enemy (player in single-player)
  3. Use strongest available ability

DEFENSIVE:
  IF health > 50%:
    Attack normally
  ELSE:
    IF has healing ability AND not on cooldown:
      Use healing ability
    ELSE:
      Attack with reduced aggression

COWARDLY:
  IF health < 30%:
    Attempt to flee (50% chance to try)
  ELSE:
    Attack weakest target

SUPPORT:
  IF ally below 50% HP AND has heal:
    Heal lowest HP ally
  ELSE IF ally exists AND has buff:
    Buff strongest ally
  ELSE:
    Attack
```

### Flee Command

```
> flee
> run

Flee Check:
  Roll: 1d10 + Finesse vs DC 12 (base) + 2 per enemy

  SUCCESS:
    "You disengage and flee to [previous room]!"
    Combat ends, player moves to previous room

  FAILURE:
    "You fail to escape!"
    Each enemy gets an opportunity attack (half damage)
    Player's turn is consumed
```

### Combat Log

```
[Combat Log - Round 3]
────────────────────────────────────
[17:32:15] You attack Goblin 1 for 12 damage (Critical Hit!)
[17:32:15] Goblin 1 defeated!
[17:32:16] Goblin 2 attacks you for 5 damage
[17:32:16] You are now at 45/60 HP
────────────────────────────────────
```

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Monsters have configurable AI behavior
- [ ] AI makes decisions based on behavior type and combat state
- [ ] Aggressive monsters always attack
- [ ] Defensive monsters heal when low
- [ ] Cowardly monsters attempt to flee when low HP
- [ ] Support monsters prioritize healing allies
- [ ] `flee` command initiates escape attempt
- [ ] Flee success returns player to previous room
- [ ] Flee failure triggers opportunity attacks
- [ ] Combat log records all combat actions
- [ ] Combat log is scrollable/reviewable
- [ ] ~18 unit tests pass

## Estimated Effort Summary

| Phase | New Files | Modified Files | Est. Tests | Complexity |
|-------|-----------|----------------|------------|------------|
| v0.0.6a | ~8 | ~6 | ~20 | Medium |
| v0.0.6b | ~5 | ~4 | ~18 | Medium |
| v0.0.6c | ~7 | ~3 | ~25 | High |
| v0.0.6d | ~4 | ~8 | ~20 | High |
| **Total** | **~24** | **~21** | **~83** | |

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Combat state complexity | High | Medium | Clear state machine design |
| Status effect balance | Medium | High | Start with simple effects, tune later |
| AI behavior edge cases | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive unit tests |
| Effect interaction bugs | High | Medium | Explicit interaction rules in config |
| Performance with many effects | Low | Low | Limit active effects per entity |
| Breaking existing combat | High | Medium | Backwards compatibility layer |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review & Approve** - Confirm scope breakdown with stakeholders
2. **v0.0.6a Design Spec** - Create detailed design specification
3. **v0.0.6a Implementation Plan** - Create implementation plan with code
4. **Implement v0.0.6a** - Build multi-monster combat
5. **Repeat for v0.0.6b, v0.0.6c, v0.0.6d**

---

## Design Decisions (Confirmed)

The following decisions have been confirmed and should be applied across all sub-phases:

### Combat Mechanics

| Decision | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Monster Limit** | 5 per room | Maximum monsters in a single room encounter |
| **Initiative Tie-Breaking** | Highest Finesse wins | When initiative totals are equal, use Finesse as tiebreaker |
| **Flee Destination** | Previous room | Player returns to the room they entered from |

### Status Effect Stacking

**Debuffs with Duration Refresh:**

| Effect | Stacking Behavior |
|--------|-------------------|
| Bleeding | **Refresh duration only** |
| Poisoned | **Refresh duration only** |
| Burning | **Refresh duration only** |
| Frozen | **Refresh duration only** |
| Weakened | **Refresh duration only** |
| Slowed | **Refresh duration only** |
| Exhausted | **Refresh duration only** |

**All Other Debuffs:** **Blocked/Resisted** if already active

**All Buffs:** **Blocked** (no stacking allowed)

> **Important:** Buffs cannot stack under any circumstances. A character cannot have two instances of Fortified, Invisible, Hasted, or any other buff. This prevents characters from becoming overpowered.

**Environmental Effects:**
- Wet, Chilled: **Refresh duration only**
- On Fire, Electrified: **Blocked** if already active

### Environmental Effect Spreading

- Environmental effects (On Fire, etc.) spread **only via AoE abilities/attacks**
- Spreading targets depend on source:
  - **Enemy-triggered AoE**: Spreads to friendly targets only
  - **Player-triggered AoE**: Spreads to enemy targets only
- No automatic spreading to adjacent entities

### Monster AI & Status Effects

Monster AI **should consider its own status effects** and adapt behavior:

| Status Effect | AI Behavior Modification |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| **Cursed** | Won't try to heal unless HP is critically low |
| **Blinded** | Will attempt to close to melee range |
| **Silenced** | Will use physical attacks instead of abilities |
| **Poisoned/Bleeding** | May prioritize cleansing if available |
| **Feared** | Will attempt to flee (overrides normal behavior) |

This creates more tactical depth and makes status effects feel impactful against intelligent enemies.

*This scope breakdown provides a structured approach to implementing v0.0.6 Enhanced Combat System. Each sub-phase builds on the previous, allowing for incremental development and testing.*
