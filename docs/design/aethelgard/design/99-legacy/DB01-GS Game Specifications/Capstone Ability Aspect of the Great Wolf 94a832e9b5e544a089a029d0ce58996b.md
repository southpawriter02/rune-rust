## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Aspect of the Great Wolf is the Vargr-Born's **capstone transformation**—the moment they achieve perfect synthesis with their primal spirit and become the ultimate predator. This is the culmination of their entire kit, removing resource costs and granting fear immunity.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Enter [Aspect of the Wolf] state for 3 rounds
- **While Active:** Savage Claws costs no Stamina; Terrifying Howl costs no Fury and can Stun
- **Immunity:** Immune to [Fear] and [Disoriented] during transformation
- **Cost on Exit:** Moderate Psychic Stress when effect ends
- **Fantasy Delivery:** Becoming the Great Wolf incarnate

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Extreme (effective god-mode for 3 rounds)
- **High Fury Requirement:** 75 Fury demands significant buildup
- **Once Per Combat:** Cannot be repeated or extended
- **Psychic Stress Cost:** Drawback occurs when transformation ends

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Vargr-Born stops being human.

Their eyes go **gold**. Their form *shifts*—not physically, but spiritually, the primal wolf-spirit that sleeps in their blood awakening fully. They grow larger, more terrifying, more *real* than anything around them. They are no longer channeling the Great Wolf.

**They ARE the Great Wolf.**

For three rounds, they are the apex predator of the uncorrupted world made manifest. Their claws tear without cost. Their howl stuns without effort. Fear cannot touch them. Chaos cannot disorient them. They are pure, primal perfection.

And then it ends. The spirit retreats, and the Vargr-Born collapses to their knees, blood streaming from nose and ears, their mortal mind shattered by the weight of what they became.

### Thematic Resonance

Aspect of the Great Wolf is the ultimate expression of the Vargr-Born identity—proof that their primal bloodline connects them to something ancient, powerful, and terrifying.

### Activation

- **Action Type:** Bonus Action (can be used with other action)

| **Immunity** | Immune to [Fear] and [Disoriented] |

### Exit Cost (Paid When Effect Ends)
