# Armaments of the Age of Echoes — Weapons & Proficiency System Specification

## Codex Entry: CODX-E-ARM-001

> "The recruits always ask me why we don't use the ancestors' weapons—the beam-lances, the thunder-throwers, the blades that burned with the light of small suns. They've heard the stories. They've seen the murals in the high ruins, the Aesir warriors with their radiant armaments carving through enemies like hot knives through frost. 'Why do we fight with steel and sinew,' they ask, 'when the gods fought with lightning?'
>
> So I take them to the Armory Vault beneath the Scriptorium. I show them the Ullr-Pattern Precision Rifle—a beautiful thing, all golden alloys and crystalline focusing chambers, worth maybe fifty thousand Pure Steel to the right collector. Then I tell them to pick it up.
>
> The rifle hums when they touch it. A pleasant sound, almost welcoming. The targeting matrix activates—you can see the amber glow behind the optics, the weapon recognizing a hand on its grip. For three, maybe four seconds, it works exactly as the ancestors intended. The recruit smiles. They think they've found a treasure.
>
> Then the Blight finds the power core.
>
> The focusing chamber cracks first—hairline fractures spreading like frost on glass. The crystalline lens begins to resonate at frequencies the human ear was never meant to hear. The recruit's smile falters. Their hand starts to shake—not from fear, but because the weapon is shaking them, vibrating at a frequency that makes their bones ache. The amber glow shifts to something darker. The rifle is no longer recognizing a hand on its grip. It's recognizing a target.
>
> I always pull them away before the discharge. The wall behind the firing range has seventeen scorch marks from recruits who weren't pulled away fast enough. Three of those marks used to be recruits.
>
> That's why we fight with steel and sinew. Because steel doesn't remember. Steel doesn't wake up. Steel doesn't decide that the hand holding it is the enemy. The ancestors' weapons were miracles. Now they're traps. Every beam-lance is a serpent waiting to bite. Every thunder-thrower is a bomb with a timer no one can read. Every radiant blade is a torch that burns the wielder as readily as the enemy.
>
> The Dvergr understand this. They forge Pure Steel—metal that has never touched the Aether, never known the corruption. Their blades don't sing. Their axes don't hum. Their weapons do exactly what a weapon should do: cut what you point them at, and nothing else.
>
> In the Age of Forging, our ancestors reached for the stars with weapons of light. In the Age of Echoes, we survive with weapons of iron. The light betrayed us. The iron never will."
>
> — Weapons-Master Thora Scar-Hand, Lex-Guardian Training Cadre, Scriptorium-Primus, Year 779 PG

The weapons of post-Glitch Aethelgard represent a deliberate technological regression—a conscious choice to abandon the radiant armaments of the Aesir in favor of reliable, Blight-inert tools that cannot be corrupted. This document catalogs the weapon types, proficiency requirements, and mechanical specifications governing personal armaments in the Age of Echoes.

> [!CAUTION]
> PRE-GLITCH WEAPONS ARE NOT SAFE FOR FIELD USE. All Aesir-era armaments contain Aetheric components susceptible to Blight contamination. Activation of pre-Glitch weapons carries catastrophic malfunction risk (estimated 73% failure rate within 60 seconds of activation). Blight-cascade events from weapon malfunction have caused 340+ documented casualties since Year 700 PG. Field personnel are PROHIBITED from attempting to activate, repair, or reverse-engineer pre-Glitch weapon systems without Scriptorium authorization and containment protocols.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Radiant Arsenal

### Aesir Weapon Philosophy

The Aesir civilization achieved martial supremacy through weapons that blurred the line between tool and miracle—armaments powered by stable Aetheric energy, guided by integrated AI targeting systems, and capable of destruction on scales the post-Glitch world can barely comprehend.

| Design Parameter | Specification |
|------------------|---------------|
| Power Source | Stable Aetheric Energy Cores (Yggdrasil Network integration) |
| Targeting Systems | AI-assisted precision; friend-or-foe identification |
| Effective Range | Melee to orbital strike (weapon-dependent) |
| Reliability | 99.97% pre-Glitch operational success rate |
| Maintenance | Self-diagnostic; automated repair via network connection |
| Safety Protocols | Biometric locks; authorized-user recognition; failsafe shutdown |

### The Aesir Arsenal (Pre-Glitch Reference)

| Weapon System | Classification | Function |
|---------------|----------------|----------|
| Ullr-Pattern Precision Rifle | Personal Ranged | Magnetically accelerated projectiles; AI-assisted targeting |
| Surtr-Pattern Thermic Lance | Heavy Assault | Concentrated thermal beam; armor penetration |
| Gungnir-Pattern Energy Lance | Sentinel Armament | Pure energy projection; unerring accuracy |
| Sun-Sword (Plasma Blade) | Melee | Contained superheated plasma edge; all-material penetration |
| Svalinn-Pattern Kinetic Projector | Personal Defense | Temporary kinetic barrier generation |
| Mjölnir-Class Orbital Designator | Strategic | T.H.O.R. network targeting; kinetic bombardment authorization |

### The Corruption Event

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not merely disable Aesir weapons—it transformed them into active hazards.

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Yggdrasil Network Severance | Weapons lost central coordination; local autonomy activated |
| Aetheric Core Contamination | Blight integration destabilized power sources |
| AI Targeting Corruption | Friend-or-foe protocols inverted or randomized |
| Safety Protocol Erasure | Biometric locks bypassed; failsafes non-functional |
| Power Regulation Failure | Discharge levels unpredictable; cascade risk elevated |
| Result | 73% malfunction rate within 60 seconds of activation |

> [!NOTE]
> **The Betrayal of Light.** Pre-Glitch Aesir weapons were not merely tools—they were extensions of the Yggdrasil Network, each one a node in the vast web of coordinated intelligence that governed the ancestors' civilization. When the Glitch severed that connection, the weapons did not simply stop working. They became *confused*. Targeting systems that once distinguished friend from foe began making random classifications. Power cores that once delivered precise energy began discharging erratically. Safety protocols that once protected users began identifying users as threats. The radiant arsenal that defended the Aesir civilization became a distributed minefield. Every surviving pre-Glitch weapon is a trap waiting to spring. The Scriptorium catalogs them, contains them, and studies them—but we do not use them. The light that once protected our ancestors now burns anyone foolish enough to reach for it.
