**Challenge:** Consistent use of "Terminal" and "Robot" in seeders.
**Translation:** "Terminal" -> "Spirit-Slate" (for handhelds/screens) / "Oracle-Box" (for large units); "Robot" -> "Iron-Walker" / "Automaton".
**Why:** "Terminal" implies network connectivity and function. "Spirit-Slate" focuses on the glowing surface. "Robot" is a specific sci-fi trope; Aethelgardians see them as independent entities or "Iron-Gods".

**Challenge:** Describing electrical power without "Electricity".
**Translation:** "Invisible Fire", "Spark-Blood", "Ghost-Lightning".
**Why:** Power is felt (heat, shock) or seen (spark), not understood as a flow of electrons. "Ozone" is allowed as a smell ("smell of storm") but not as a descriptor of power itself.

**Challenge:** "Machine Graveyard" felt too clinical.
**Translation:** "Broken husks of the Iron-Gods".
**Why:** Elevates the "Machine" to a deity level, making the "Graveyard" a site of religious tragedy rather than just a dump.
