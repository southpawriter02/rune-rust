### **I. Core Philosophy: The Uncorrupted Echo**

The **Vargr-Born** is the Warrior specialization that embodies the philosophy of the **uncorrupted, primal echo**. Their bloodline has become fused with a sliver of the world's **original, stable source code**—an ancient, predatory "wolf" spirit that is pure, logical, and utterly savage. This makes them a living **counter-frequency** to the Great Silence.

To choose the Vargr-Born is to embrace the fantasy of the feral brawler and the psychological predator. Your howl is a blast of pure, coherent reality that can shatter a Blighted creature's fractured mind.
