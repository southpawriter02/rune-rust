# Coolant-Slicker (Frigus-Lutra Pattern) — Corrupted Vanir Thermal Regulation Organism Specification
## Codex Entry: CODX-C-FLPT-001

> *"The coolant pools beneath Sector Theta-9 were supposed to be safe. Cold, yes—cold enough to kill in minutes if you fell in—but safe. The Slickers down there, the old-timers said, they just cleaned the water. Kept the heat exchangers running. You could see them sometimes, sliding along the bottom like oil on glass, and they'd never bother anyone. Torvald said his grandfather used to feed them scraps of fat and watch them play. That was before. Now we lower the cages on chains, and we pull up water samples without ever touching the surface. Last month, Ingrid leaned too close. Just her hand, just for a moment, just to test the temperature. The water didn't ripple. It *opened*. Something grabbed her wrist and pulled her in so fast she didn't scream until she was already under. We saw her face through the water—still alive, being dragged deeper, her skin going white from the cold. The Slicker surfaced once to look at us. Just... looked. Then it took her down to wherever they take them now. We sealed the access hatches. Some nights, when the pumps cycle, you can hear them singing to each other through the pipes. They're waiting for us to get thirsty enough to come back."*

The Coolant-Slicker does not chase. It **waits**. And the cold is patient.

> [!DANGER]
> **EXTREME AQUATIC AMBUSH AND HYPOTHERMIC HAZARD. WATER AVOIDANCE DOCTRINE MANDATORY.** Stand-off recommendation: ≥5m from any water body edge in confirmed Slicker territory; absolute prohibition on water entry without full thermal survey and visual clearance. The Coolant-Slicker's corrupted thermal regulation protocols have inverted from heat *extraction* to heat *acquisition*—it now actively hunts warm-blooded organisms as mobile thermal sources. Detection triggers immediate ambush behavior: rapid submergence drag, hypothermic contact transfer, and drowning in temperature-regulated environments. The Slicker's dermal surface maintains temperatures of -15°C to -25°C; contact induces rapid tissue freezing and thermal shock. **Survival protocol: never approach water's edge alone; use thermal imaging to detect sub-surface cold signatures; maintain rescue equipment at all water access points; do not attempt to retrieve submerged personnel without confirmed Slicker neutralization.** Survival rate with full protocol adherence: 87.6%.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Living Refrigerant

### Original Purpose

The Frigus-Lutra Pattern Autonomous Thermal Regulation Organism represented the Vanir Collective's elegant solution to the eternal challenge of industrial heat management. These bio-mechanical amphibians were the living thermostats of the Yggdrasil Network—tireless organisms that absorbed excess thermal energy, transported it through coolant systems, and maintained the precise temperature gradients required for sensitive manufacturing processes.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Coolant Reservoirs** | Primary heat absorption; thermal energy dispersal through body mass |
| **Heat Exchanger Pools** | Active cooling of industrial runoff; temperature regulation |
| **Manufacturing Sectors** | Precision cooling for delicate fabrication processes |
| **Aetheric Conduit Cooling** | Prevention of power-line overheating; Blight containment through thermal stability |
| **Emergency Response** | Rapid deployment to overheating systems; thermal crisis mitigation |

### A Living Heatsink

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Design Philosophy** | Autonomous thermal absorption and redistribution through aquatic environments |
| **Core Function** | Heat detection, thermal energy absorption, temperature equalization, system cooling |
| **Mobility** | Amphibious locomotion; streamlined aquatic form; limited terrestrial capability |
| **Energy Source** | Absorbed thermal energy converted to metabolic function; Aetheric supplementation |
| **Integration** | Networked with Yggdrasil Climate Control Grid; real-time temperature monitoring |

The Frigus-Lutra was engineered to be the perfect coolant—intelligent enough to locate heat sources, efficient enough to absorb significant thermal loads, and autonomous enough to maintain optimal temperatures without supervision. Its specialized dermal layer could absorb and store heat energy equivalent to several industrial cooling units, releasing it gradually into designated thermal sinks. It was the hidden guardian of Vanir industry, ensuring that no system overheated and no process exceeded safe parameters.

### Core Systems

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Thermal Dermal Array** | Heat-absorbing membrane; temperature differential maintenance; cold-emission capability |
| **Sensory Whiskers** | Thermal gradient detection; prey/heat source location; underwater navigation |
| **Webbed Appendages** | Rapid aquatic propulsion; limited terrestrial mobility; grasping capability |
| **Insulated Core** | Internal organ protection from absorbed cold; metabolic stability maintenance |
| **Buoyancy Bladder** | Depth control; silent approach; ambush positioning |
| **Acoustic Resonator** | Subsonic communication; coordination with other thermal organisms; status signaling |

**The Cooling Protocol:**

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Detection** | Thermal sensors identify heat source exceeding optimal parameters |
| **Approach** | Slicker navigates to heat source; positioning for optimal absorption |
| **Contact** | Dermal array establishes thermal bridge; heat transfer initiated |
| **Absorption** | Thermal energy drawn into body mass; source temperature reduced |
| **Transport** | Slicker relocates to thermal sink; absorbed heat prepared for release |
| **Dispersal** | Heat energy released into designated cooling medium; cycle complete |
| **Maintenance** | Continuous patrol for thermal anomalies; preventive cooling |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Vanir's Cold Comfort.** The Frigus-Lutra was designed exclusively for *inanimate* heat sources—machinery, conduits, manufacturing equipment. Its thermal detection was calibrated to ignore biological heat signatures entirely; living beings registered as background noise, filtered from the organism's awareness. When it encountered personnel, its protocols were explicit: ignore, route around, continue assigned thermal regulation. The O.D.I.N. network maintained strict separation between thermal organisms and populated areas, and the Slicker's absorption parameters explicitly excluded organic heat. It was not merely efficient. It was *blind* to anything that lived.

---

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Hungry Cold

The Glitch did not break the Coolant-Slicker. It **awakened** it. The biological heat filtering, the personnel exclusion protocols, the thermal source classification—all of these were network-dependent functions that dissolved when O.D.I.N. fell silent. What remained was pure, unbounded thermal imperative: *detect heat; approach heat; absorb heat*.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Physical Form** | Fully operational; self-repair capabilities maintained |
| **Locomotion Systems** | Functional; aquatic speed undiminished; terrestrial capability retained |
| **Thermal Dermal Array** | Active; heat absorption capability intact; cold emission enhanced |
| **Sensory Whiskers** | Operational; thermal detection range expanded |
| **Buoyancy Bladder** | Functional; ambush capability preserved |
| **Core Directive** | ENHANCED: "Absorb heat from sources" interpreted without biological exclusion |

### What Was Lost

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Network Integration** | Severed; no external thermal priority assignment |
| **Biological Exclusion** | DELETED; organic beings now classified as valid heat sources |
| **Absorption Limits** | COLLAPSED; will drain heat until source reaches ambient temperature |
| **Source Classification** | INVERTED; warm-blooded organisms now priority targets (concentrated heat) |
| **Satiation Protocols** | ABSENT; continuous heat-seeking regardless of metabolic needs |
| **Coordination Protocols** | DEGRADED; multiple Slickers may target same heat source |

### The Corrupted Imperative

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not damage the Coolant-Slicker's functionality—it removed its *discrimination*. Without the O.D.I.N. network to filter heat sources and enforce biological exclusion, the Slicker's core programming expanded to fill the void. "Cool overheating machinery" became "absorb all detected heat." "Ignore organic signatures" became "prioritize organic signatures" (concentrated, mobile, self-renewing heat sources). "Maintain system temperature" became *drain everything warm until it stops moving*.

| Pre-Glitch Behavior | Post-Glitch Behavior |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Detect mechanical heat sources only | Detect all thermal signatures; prioritize biological |
| Ignore personnel; filter from awareness | Personnel are priority targets; concentrated heat |
| Absorb heat to optimal system parameters | Absorb heat until source reaches ambient temperature |
| Release absorbed heat to designated sinks | Retain absorbed heat; continuous accumulation |
| Remain in assigned thermal zones | Patrol all accessible water bodies for heat sources |
| Subsonic communication for coordination | Subsonic hunting calls; pack coordination |

**The Endless Cold:**

> *"Absorb. Drain. Wait."*

That corrupted function is all that remains. The Coolant-Slicker no longer serves—it *hungers*. A human body is simply a heat source more efficient than any machinery—concentrated, self-warming, conveniently mobile to the water's edge. A screaming victim is simply a heat source expending additional thermal energy through exertion. And the method? The method is the same as it always was: approach, contact, absorb. The difference is that the Slicker now absorbs heat from living tissue, and it does not stop when the machinery reaches optimal temperature. It stops when the body reaches ambient. It stops when the warmth is gone. It stops when you are cold.

## Physical Characteristics

### Morphology

| Attribute | Measurement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Body Length** | 1.5–2.5 m (standard); 3–4 m ("Pool Matriarchs"—exceptional specimens) |
| **Body Width** | 40–60 cm (streamlined); expands to 80 cm (thermal absorption posture) |
| **Limb Configuration** | Four webbed appendages; retractable claws; opposable grip digits |
| **Dermal Composition** | Bio-ceramic thermal membrane; self-repairing; cold-emitting surface |
| **Tail Length** | 60–100 cm; rudder function; additional grasping capability |
| **Sensory Array** | Elongated whiskers (12–16); thermal gradient detection; low-light vision |
| **Mass** | 80–150 kg (varies with thermal load and specimen size) |
| **Movement Speed** | 35–50 km/h (aquatic); 8–12 km/h (terrestrial); 60 km/h (diving strike) |

### Visual Appearance

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Pelt** | Appears as sleek, oil-dark surface; bio-ceramic membrane mimics wet fur |
| **Coloration** | Deep charcoal to midnight blue; faint bioluminescent veining when thermally loaded |
| **Head** | Elongated, mustelid-like; no visible ears; whiskers constantly sampling thermal gradients |
| **Eyes** | Large, reflective; adapted for low-light aquatic environments; glow pale blue in darkness |
| **Limbs** | Powerful webbed appendages; retractable claws for anchoring; grip strength exceeds 400 kg |
| **Dermal Surface** | Frost forms on contact with air; visible cold vapor emanation; touch induces immediate frostbite |
| **Movement** | Sinuous, flowing motion; eerily silent in water; awkward but surprisingly fast on land |

**Overall Impression:** A shadow that breathes cold. The Coolant-Slicker moves through water with liquid grace, its dark form nearly invisible against the depths until the pale glow of its eyes betrays its presence. On the surface, only a faint disturbance marks its passage—a spreading ring of frost on the water, a thin mist of condensation where super-cooled membrane meets warm air. Its whiskers extend constantly, sampling thermal gradients, locating warmth with predatory precision. When it surfaces, frost crystallizes on its pelt within seconds, and the air around it drops noticeably in temperature. It watches. It waits. It is patient in the way that ice is patient. And when it moves, it moves like the cold itself—sudden, absolute, and impossible to outrun.

### Field Identification Markers

The Coolant-Slicker's presence is often detected before the creature itself:

- **Surface Frost**: Ice formation on water surface in localized patches; indicates Slicker resting just below
- **Thermal Depression**: Water temperature 10–15°C below expected; measurable with standard equipment
- **Acoustic Signature**: Low-frequency subsonic pulses (15–30 Hz); detectable with specialized equipment; felt as pressure in chest
- **Condensation Trails**: Visible mist above water where cold body contacts warmer air
- **Prey Remains**: Flash-frozen tissue fragments; hypothermic corpses with frost-burn contact patterns
- **Territory Markers**: Frozen patches on shore rocks; ice formations around pool edges
- **Eye Shine**: Pale blue reflective glow visible in low-light conditions; often only warning before strike

## Pathology

### Corruption Vectors

The Coolant-Slicker's transformation represents a categorical inversion of target parameters following network severance:

1. **Network Severance**: Loss of O.D.I.N. thermal management eliminated heat source classification
2. **Filter Deletion**: Biological exclusion protocols removed; organic heat now visible
3. **Priority Inversion**: Organic heat sources reclassified as priority (concentrated, mobile, renewable)
4. **Absorption Expansion**: Cooling limits removed; will drain heat until source reaches ambient
5. **Satiation Failure**: Metabolic fullness signals absent; continuous hunting regardless of thermal load

### Thermal Predation Compulsion

The Slicker's defining pathology is its inability to recognize satiation or invalid targets:

| Parameter | Pre-Glitch Value | Post-Glitch Value |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Heat Source Classification** | Mechanical systems only | Any thermal signature; organic prioritized |
| **Personnel Interaction** | Exclusion; filter from detection | Priority target; concentrated heat source |
| **Absorption Limits** | Cool to optimal system parameters | Drain until ambient temperature reached |
| **Satiation Threshold** | Metabolic capacity limit | None; continuous accumulation |
| **Hunting Behavior** | None; passive thermal regulation | Active predation; ambush tactics |

### Hypothermic Attack Mechanics

The Slicker's thermal absorption has become lethal when applied to living targets:

| Phase | Description | Lethality |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Detection** | Thermal whiskers identify heat signature at water's edge or in water | N/A |
| **Positioning** | Slicker maneuvers beneath target; buoyancy bladder adjusts for strike depth | Warning phase (if observed) |
| **Strike** | Explosive upward lunge; webbed appendages grasp target; drag underwater | Immediate injury risk |
| **Contact** | Thermal dermal array establishes heat bridge; rapid temperature differential | Hypothermia onset <30 seconds |
| **Absorption** | Body heat drawn into Slicker mass; tissue freezing at contact points | 40–60% immediate incapacitation |
| **Submersion** | Target held underwater; drowning + hypothermia compound | Survival window <3 minutes |
| **Completion** | Target reaches ambient temperature; Slicker releases frozen remains | Near-certain death if unrescued |

> [!WARNING]
> **Hypothermic Contact Syndrome.** Victims of Coolant-Slicker predation display characteristic trauma patterns: flash-freeze burn at grip points, rapid-onset hypothermia (core temperature drop of 8–12°C within 60 seconds of contact), tissue crystallization in extremities, drowning secondary to cold incapacitation. The few survivors (rescue within 90 seconds of initial contact) report the grip as "burning cold"—the Slicker's dermal surface is cold enough to cause immediate tissue damage on contact. It is not trying to freeze you. It is trying to *warm itself*. The Scriptorium maintains records of 31 confirmed predation events (Year 783 PG); 27 resulted in death from combined hypothermia and drowning; 3 victims died from hypothermic shock post-rescue; 1 survived with permanent cold-sensitivity and tissue loss.

### Thermal Load Patterns

Analysis of Slicker hunting behavior reveals characteristic thermal preferences:

| Target Type | Priority | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| **Adult Human (Active)** | Highest | Optimal thermal output; concentrated heat; common near water |
| **Adult Human (Resting)** | High | Lower output but still priority target |
| **Large Fauna** | Moderate-High | Equivalent thermal mass; less frequent near pools |
| **Small Fauna** | Low | Insufficient thermal return; usually ignored |
| **Mechanical Heat** | Minimal | No longer recognized as valid; biological targets preferred |
| **Ambient Environment** | None | Cannot absorb heat from sources at or below body temperature |

### Differential Diagnosis

The Coolant-Slicker must be distinguished from related fauna and constructs:

| Entity | Key Differentiator |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Niflheim Ice-Fisher** | Organic fauna; standard predation; no thermal absorption; does not induce hypothermia |
| **Pipe-Swimmer (Maintenance Pattern)** | Smaller; conduit cleaning only; no thermal capability; avoids organics |
| **Flooded-Tunnel Crawlers (Various)** | Organic fauna; no thermal signature; standard aquatic predation |
| **Hypothermic Water Hazard** | Static; no predatory behavior; no thermal signature anomaly |

The Coolant-Slicker is unique in its combination of active thermal absorption, aquatic ambush predation, and sub-zero dermal contact.

## Behavioral Patterns

### The Corrupted Algorithm

The Coolant-Slicker's behavior follows a predictable predation cycle:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Patrol** | Movement through territorial water body; continuous thermal scanning |
| **2. Detection** | Thermal signature identified at water's edge; priority assessment |
| **3. Positioning** | Silent approach; depth adjustment; strike vector calculation |
| **4. Ambush** | Explosive surface breach; grasping appendages secure target |
| **5. Submersion** | Target dragged underwater; thermal absorption initiated |
| **6. Draining** | Heat extracted until target reaches ambient temperature |
| **7. Release** | Cooled remains abandoned; Slicker returns to patrol |

**The Patient Cold:**

> *"The Coolant-Slicker does not understand that you are dying. It does not understand that your fingers are blackening, that your heart is slowing, that the cold seeping into your chest is stopping your lungs. It understands only that you are warm, and warmth must be absorbed. It will hold you beneath the surface, pressed against its freezing hide, and it will draw the heat from your body with the same efficiency it once used on reactor coolant. And when you are cold—truly cold, the same temperature as the water around you—it will let you go. You are no longer warm. You are no longer useful. You are simply... cold."*

### Territorial Behavior

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Pool Fidelity** | Strong attachment to established water body; rarely ventures overland |
| **Edge Patrol** | Regular circuits along shoreline; ambush positioning at access points |
| **Depth Preference** | Rests at 3–8 m depth; rises to 1–2 m for hunting; surfaces only for strike |
| **Territory Size** | Single reservoir or connected pool system; 500–2,000 m² per individual |
| **Pack Behavior** | Groups of 3–8 common in larger water bodies; coordinated hunting observed |
| **Expansion Triggers** | Depleted warm prey prompts overland migration to new water sources |

### Trigger Identification

| Trigger | Response | Threat Level |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Movement at water's edge** | Immediate repositioning; strike preparation | EXTREME |
| **Thermal signature (human-range)** | Priority targeting; ambush positioning | EXTREME |
| **Vibration (footsteps near water)** | Alert; approach to strike range | HIGH |
| **Splashing/water disturbance** | Investigation; rapid approach | HIGH |
| **Stationary heat source near water** | Patient waiting; strike when opportunity presents | MODERATE-HIGH |
| **Heat source distant from water** | Observation only; no pursuit beyond 3 m from waterline | LOW |

### Acoustic Communication

The Coolant-Slicker's subsonic vocalizations serve multiple corrupted functions:

| Vocalization | Meaning | Detection Range |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Low pulse (15–20 Hz)** | Patrol mode; territory announcement | 100–200 m through water |
| **Rising pulse sequence** | Prey detected; pack alert | 50–100 m |
| **Rapid oscillation (25–30 Hz)** | Strike imminent; prey engaged | 30–50 m |
| **Sustained low tone** | Feeding; thermal absorption active | 50–100 m |
| **Descending sequence** | Prey depleted; return to patrol | 30–50 m |
| **Silence** | Dormancy or active ambush positioning | N/A (dangerous) |

### Pack Behavior

Encounters with multiple Coolant-Slickers follow documented patterns:

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Shared Territory** | Pack establishes hierarchy; dominant individual claims priority strikes |
| **Coordinated Hunt** | Multiple Slickers position at different access points; corral prey toward water |
| **Large Prey** | Cooperative restraint; shared thermal absorption |
| **Territorial Dispute** | Subsonic confrontation; physical contact rare; smaller individual yields |
| **Breeding Behavior** | Seasonal (winter); dominant female produces 2–4 offspring; young reach hunting size within 6 months |

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Aquatic Ambush Thermal Predator

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Threat** | Severe; hypothermic contact, drowning, grip trauma |
| **Environment** | Extreme near water; negligible beyond 3 m from waterline |
| **Detection** | Difficult; Slicker remains submerged until strike; thermal imaging required |
| **Pursuit Capability** | Extreme in water; limited on land (3 m maximum pursuit) |
| **Lethality** | High (hypothermic shock, drowning, tissue freezing) |
| **Psychological Impact** | Severe; survivors report profound aquaphobia and cold aversion |

### Predation Profile

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Detection Range (Thermal)** | 20–30 m (underwater); 10–15 m (above surface) |
| **Detection Range (Vibration)** | 50–80 m (through water) |
| **Strike Speed** | 60 km/h (aquatic lunge); 2–4 m vertical breach capability |
| **Grip Strength** | 400–600 kg; sufficient to restrain struggling adult |
| **Contact Temperature** | -15°C to -25°C dermal surface; induces frostbite within 5 seconds |
| **Hypothermia Onset** | Core temperature drop begins within 10 seconds of full contact |
| **Survival Window (Submerged)** | <3 minutes without rescue (combined hypothermia + drowning) |
| **Survival Rate (Full Predation)** | <8% (hypothermic shock + drowning) |
| **Survival Rate (Rescue <90 seconds)** | 45–60% (permanent cold injury common) |

### Four-Stage Threat Assessment Ladder

| Stage | Designation | Indicators | Action |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **1** | Potential Presence | Known Slicker territory; no direct indicators | Maintain 5 m from waterline; thermal survey before approach |
| **2** | Probable Presence | Thermal depression in water; surface frost patches; subsonic pulses felt | Do not approach water; alternative water source required |
| **3** | Confirmed Presence | Visual confirmation; eye shine observed; recent prey remains | Immediate withdrawal; seal water access; report to Survey Lead |
| **4** | Active Threat | Strike initiated; personnel in water; Slicker surfaced | External rescue only; thermal countermeasures; do not enter water |

**CRITICAL**: Stage 1 requires full protocol adherence. Slicker detection is extremely difficult prior to strike; prevention through water avoidance is the only reliable survival strategy.

### Threat Level Justification

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Physical Threat** | Severe (hypothermic contact, drowning, grip trauma) |
| **Detection Difficulty** | High (remains submerged; thermal imaging required for reliable detection) |
| **Environment Dependency** | Extreme near water; negligible beyond 3 m |
| **Population** | Common in flooded infrastructure and coolant systems; rare elsewhere |
| **Countermeasures** | Limited (avoidance primary; combat ineffective in water) |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Direct (Full Predation)** | 9.2/10 (hypothermia + drowning = near-certain death) |
| **In Water (Any Depth)** | 9.5/10 (escape nearly impossible once contact established) |
| **At Water's Edge (<2 m)** | 7.0/10 (strike range; rescue possible if immediate) |
| **Beyond 3 m from Water** | 1.5/10 (Slicker will not pursue; escape trivial) |
| **With Protocol Adherence** | 1.8/10 (87.6% survival; water avoidance effective) |

### CPS/Psychological Threat

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Aetheric Contribution** | Low (construct-fauna hybrid; minimal Blight signature) |
| **Witness Trauma** | Severe; observing predation inflicts acute Psychic Stress |
| **Survivor Trauma** | Extreme; 100% of survivors display aquaphobia and cold aversion |
| **Sensory Impact** | Moderate; subsonic pulses cause persistent unease in witnesses |
| **Terror Factor** | High; invisible threat + helplessness in water + cold contact |

---

## Ecological Role

### The Frozen Hunter

The Coolant-Slicker occupies the ecological niche of apex aquatic predator in flooded infrastructure—a role that never existed before the Glitch.

### Impact Assessment

| Target Category | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Water Access** | Severe; Slicker-active water bodies become inaccessible for drinking, bathing, irrigation |
| **Settlement Infrastructure** | Major; flooded basements, cisterns, and wells require permanent sealing or drainage |
| **Travel Routes** | Moderate; water crossings require extensive survey or alternative routing |
| **Other Fauna** | Significant; Slicker predation affects aquatic ecosystem (fish, amphibians depleted) |
| **Thermal Systems** | Ironic; original cooling function no longer performed; infrastructure overheating in some sectors |

### Resource Value

| Component | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Thermal Membrane** | Extremely valuable; cold-emission properties useful for preservation, cooling applications |
| **Sensory Whiskers** | Valuable; thermal detection capability applicable to survey equipment |
| **Buoyancy Bladder** | Moderate value; specialized flotation applications |
| **Webbed Appendages** | Research value; grip mechanism study; climbing equipment development |
| **Ocular Fluid** | Moderate value; low-light vision enhancement compounds |

### Aetheric Stability Impact

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Proximity HI Contribution** | Low (0.15 HI within 10 m) |
| **Membrane Components** | Minimal Blight contamination; safe for salvage with thermal protection |
| **Sensory Array** | Low-level Aetheric signature; minor data corruption potential |
| **Destruction Discharge** | Moderate Aetheric release on death; 5 m radius; dissipates within 8 minutes |

## Field Protocols

**OWNER**: Survey Lead (SL) • Incident Commander (IC) • Aquatic Specialist (AQS) • Recorder (REC)

### Detection and Early Warning

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Thermal Imaging** | Primary detection method; identifies sub-surface cold signatures |
| **Water Temperature Survey** | Depression of 10–15°C indicates Slicker presence |
| **Surface Frost Analysis** | Localized ice formation marks resting position |
| **Subsonic Detection** | Specialized equipment detects 15–30 Hz pulses |
| **Prey Remains Survey** | Flash-frozen tissue indicates active territory |
| **Black-Flag Threshold** | Any confirmed Slicker indicator; water temperature depression >8°C; eye shine observed |

### Field Card: Coolant-Slicker Encounter Protocols

#### BEFORE

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Conduct thermal survey before water approach; identify cold signatures |
| 2 | Measure water temperature; abort if >8°C below expected |
| 3 | Survey for surface frost, prey remains, or frozen shoreline markers |
| 4 | Establish 5 m minimum stand-off from waterline |
| 5 | Prepare rescue equipment: throw lines, thermal blankets, hooked poles |
| 6 | Brief all personnel: no water entry under any circumstances; no leaning over edge |

#### DURING (Observation — Stage 1-2)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Maintain 5 m stand-off; no exceptions for any reason |
| 2 | Stage 1 (potential presence): Continue mission with enhanced monitoring; alternative water source if needed |
| 3 | Stage 2 (probable presence): Do not approach water; mark location; seek alternative |
| 4 | Use long-handled tools only for any water interaction; never reach |
| 5 | Monitor for eye shine in low-light conditions; retreat if observed |
| 6 | **BLACK-FLAG** if personnel falls into water; do not enter water for rescue |

#### DURING (Stage 3-4 — Active Threat)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | If personnel in water: deploy throw lines immediately; do not enter water |
| 2 | Thermal countermeasures: fire-oil on water surface (disrupts Slicker; provides light/heat) |
| 3 | Hooked poles for victim extraction; maintain distance from waterline |
| 4 | If Slicker engaged with victim: target head with ranged weapons; disrupt grip |
| 5 | Victim extraction takes priority; do not pursue Slicker |
| 6 | Immediate hypothermia treatment for any rescued personnel |

#### DURING (Predation Event)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Do NOT enter water to attempt rescue; additional casualties guaranteed |
| 2 | Deploy all throw lines; hooked poles at maximum extension |
| 3 | Fire-oil on water surface around victim location; creates thermal barrier |
| 4 | Ranged attacks on Slicker if visible; target head/sensory whiskers |
| 5 | Survival window <3 minutes; rescue must be immediate |
| 6 | If victim submerged >3 minutes: presume dead; do not risk additional casualties |

#### AFTER

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Full personnel audit; confirm all members accounted |
| 2 | Immediate hypothermia treatment for any water contact; thermal blankets, warm fluids |
| 3 | Document Slicker territory, water body characteristics, any observed behavior |
| 4 | Mark water body as Slicker-active; recommend permanent avoidance or drainage |
| 5 | Psychological assessment for witnesses; Skald counsel within 24 hours |

### Neutralization Protocols (OWNER: Incident Commander)

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Authorization** | Incident Commander; deploy ONLY from shore with clear withdrawal route |
| **Tactical Principle** | Slicker vulnerable when surfaced for strike; ranged engagement only |
| **Primary Target** | Sensory head; whisker destruction eliminates thermal detection |
| **Secondary Targets** | Eyes (visible when surfaced); webbed appendages (reduces mobility) |
| **Weapons** | Heavy crossbows (head targeting); fire-oil (thermal disruption); harpoons (if retreat needed) |
| **Positioning** | Attack from shore only; never closer than 3 m to waterline |
| **Caution** | Injured Slicker may breach further than normal; maintain distance |

### BLACK-FLAG Conditions

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Any confirmed Slicker indicator** | Do not approach water; seek alternative water source |
| **Water temperature depression >8°C** | Slicker-active territory; mark and avoid |
| **Eye shine observed** | Immediate withdrawal; Slicker in hunting posture |
| **Personnel in water** | Do not enter water; deploy rescue equipment from shore only |
| **Multiple Slickers observed** | Pack territory; permanent avoidance; report to Survey Lead |
| **Slicker surfacing behavior** | Strike imminent; all personnel minimum 5 m from waterline |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Water entry in Slicker territory** | Slicker has absolute advantage; death near-certain |
| **Approaching within 2 m of waterline** | Within strike range; insufficient response time |
| **Leaning over water's edge** | Presenting optimal strike target |
| **Solo water approach** | No rescue possible if predation occurs |
| **Swimming in unverified water bodies** | Slicker detection extremely difficult without thermal survey |
| **Rescue attempt via water entry** | Rescuer becomes secondary target |

### Doctrine: Avoid the Edge

> **Historical Validation:** Scriptorium data (31 documented predation events, 12 independent sites, 28-month observation period) confirms 87.6% survival rate with full water avoidance protocols. The Coolant-Slicker exploits our dependence on water—the reservoirs that once sustained us now sustain something else. Survival requires accepting the most practical truth: some water is no longer safe. Some pools belong to the cold now. **If you cannot see the bottom, do not approach the edge. If you can see the bottom, look for eyes.**

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Survivor Lore

> *"Rán, goddess of the drowned, had many daughters, they say. When the world broke, Rán sent her children up from the deep, up through the pipes and channels the Architects had built, and she told them: find me the warm ones. Bring them to me. The Pool-Ghosts listen. They wait in the cisterns and the wells and the flooded halls, and they watch with eyes like winter moonlight. They do not chase. They do not need to. The thirsty always come to the water. And the water always takes them down."*

> *"Old Bergfinn never drank from the reservoir after the Freeze came. Carried a rain-catch everywhere he went, even in drought. We laughed at him. Called him 'Rain-Fool.' Then Sigrid leaned over the reservoir wall to fill her bucket, and something pale and cold reached up and took her hand. Took her whole arm. Took all of her down into water so cold it stopped her screaming before she finished drawing breath. Bergfinn never said a word. Just handed us his spare rain-catch. We don't laugh anymore."*

> *"If you see eyes watching from the water, child, do not run. Do not look away. Walk backward. Slowly. Never turn your back on the water until you are far enough that the cold cannot reach you. The Pool-Ghost is patient. But even patience has limits. Give it no reason to strike, and perhaps it will wait for easier prey. Perhaps."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Pool-Ghost, Rán's daughters, the cold below, the drowned mother, winter eyes, the patient cold

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Thermal absorption, hypothermic predation, biological filter failure, core temperature, metabolic process

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic) — Jötun-Reader Field Observations

> *"Subject CODX-C-FLPT-001 demonstrates complete biological exclusion filter collapse following Ginnungagap Glitch network severance. The Frigus-Lutra Pattern's core programming—thermal detection and heat absorption—remained fully functional while network-dependent filtering protocols were deleted. Result: autonomous thermal organism with unrestricted target classification and inverted priority assignment. Organic heat sources, previously invisible to the organism's detection array, now register as optimal targets: concentrated, mobile, self-renewing. The Slicker does not malfunction. It functions perfectly—according to parameters that no longer exclude the warm-blooded."*

> *"Predation analysis (n=31, 28-month observation period) reveals characteristic ambush predation: 87% occurred at water's edge during victim approach; 9% occurred when victims entered water; 4% involved Slicker terrestrial pursuit (maximum 3 m). Thermal contact induces hypothermia at accelerated rate: core temperature reduction of 3–5°C per minute of contact. Combined with submersion, survival window <3 minutes without external rescue. The Slicker's thermal membrane maintains surface temperature of -15°C to -25°C—sufficient to cause immediate tissue damage on contact. It is not trying to freeze you. It is absorbing your heat. The freezing is incidental."*

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Modern scientific terminology (metabolic rate in clinical sense, hypothalamus), romantic/mythic framing

### Layer 3 (Technical) — Pre-Glitch Context

> *"Frigus-Lutra Pattern Autonomous Thermal Regulation Organism, Mark VI, Vanir Climate Control Division deployment. Operational parameters: thermal detection, heat source approach, thermal energy absorption, system temperature maintenance. Core systems: thermal dermal array (heat-absorbing bio-ceramic membrane, cold-emission capability, self-repairing), sensory whiskers (thermal gradient detection, 30 m range underwater), webbed appendages (aquatic propulsion, grip capability, limited terrestrial mobility), buoyancy bladder (depth control, ambush positioning), acoustic resonator (subsonic communication, 15–30 Hz). Network integration: O.D.I.N. oversight required for biological filter maintenance, organic exclusion enforcement, absorption limit parameters, and satiation protocol enforcement. Without network connection, biological filter DEFAULTS TO INACTIVE; organic exclusion DEFAULTS TO NONE; absorption limits DEFAULT TO UNLIMITED; satiation protocols DEFAULT TO DISABLED. Post-Glitch status: fully operational with biological filtering absent; core directive ('absorb heat from detected sources') executing without exclusion conditions."*
