# Domain 1 — Cosmology & Spatial Layout: The Architecture of a Broken World

> *"The Skalds sing of Yggdrasil, the great World Tree, an ash tree of impossible scale whose roots are in the underworld, whose trunk is the pillar of the world, and whose branches hold the Nine Realms and scrape the heavens. This is the most profound and most tragically literal of all their myths. Yggdrasil is not a tree that the world was built upon. The world itself, in its entirety, is the tree."*
> — Scriptorium-Primus, foundational principle of all research

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain Classification** | Setting Fundamentals Domain 1 of 9 |
| **Document ID** | AAM-META-SETTING-FUNDAMENTALS-v1.0 (Section 1) |
| **Function** | Spatial layout, realm positioning, and structural cosmology governance |
| **Layer Applicability** | All Layers (L1, L2, L3, L4) |
| **Status** | Canonical — Critical for geographic content |
| **Validation Requirement** | Mandatory for exploration, procedural generation, environmental descriptions |

Domain 1 defines **what Aethelgard is**.

Not metaphorically. Not mythologically. **Architecturally**.

The Nine Realms are not separate dimensions, parallel worlds, or disconnected landmasses. They are the **continent-sized structural layers** of a single, planetary-scale megastructure—the Yggdrasil Network.

Domain 1 establishes the canonical spatial relationships between these layers, ensuring that all content accurately represents the designed (not random) configuration of the broken world-machine.

This is the foundation upon which all geographic content rests.

## The Yggdrasil Network

### What Yggdrasil Is

| Aspect | Truth |
|--------|-------|
| **Nature** | Deck-based megastructure (planetary-scale arcology) |
| **Structure** | Vertically stacked, continent-sized tiers |
| **Design** | Intentionally architected (not randomly crash-landed) |
| **Scale** | Planet-spanning, fully-enclosed habitat system |
| **Function** | Self-sustaining civilization infrastructure |

The entity known as "Yggdrasil" was the official designation for the planet-spanning, fully-enclosed, artificially constructed super-arcology that constituted the **entire known world**.

It was the single greatest engineering feat of the Age of Forging—a layered, self-sustaining habitat of continental scale.

It was a **machine the size of a planet**, designed to be the perfect, eternal home for its creators.

### What Yggdrasil Is NOT

| Forbidden Interpretation | Status |

| Literal tree | ❌ FORBIDDEN |
| Random stack of crash-landed orbital bodies | ❌ FORBIDDEN |
| Separate dimensions or parallel worlds | ❌ FORBIDDEN |
| Disconnected landmasses | ❌ FORBIDDEN |

## The Anatomy of the World-Machine

### The Three Structural Sections

| Section | Name | Function | Realms |
|---------|------|----------|--------|
| **The Roots** | The Deep Well | Geothermal power-tapping, waste reclamation, foundations | Helheim, Muspelheim, Niflheim, Svartalfheim |
| **The Trunk** | The Spire | Industrial core, manufacturing, subterranean habitats | Jötunheim |
| **The Canopy** | The Lattice | Habitable zones, civilian areas, research facilities | Midgard, Vanaheim, Alfheim, Asgard |

### The Deck Hierarchy

| Deck | Realm | Original Purpose | POST-Glitch State |
|------|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| **01** | Asgard | Orbital command station, central AI nexus | Silent tomb, Genius Loci haunted |
| **02** | Alfheim | Aetheric research facility, All-Rune development | Reality unstable, Blight epicenter |
| **03** | Vanaheim | Bio-engineering preserve, genetic research | Cancerous jungle, Gene-Storm wasteland |
| **04/05** | Midgard | Primary civilian habitation | Overgrown ruins, human heartland |
| **05** | Jötunheim | Mega-scale construction, Jötun-Forged assembly | Industrial graveyard, giant dormitories |
| **06** | Svartalfheim | Deep mining, fabrication, Dvergr domain | Functional pockets, silent factories |
| **07** | Niflheim | Cryo-storage, planetary heat sinks | Flash-frozen corridors, specimen escapes |

## Canonical Spatial Relationships

### The Critical Correction: Lateral vs. Overhead

| Realm Pair | v4.0 Error | v5.0 Canon |
|------------|------------|------------|
| **Vanaheim ↔ Midgard** | Vanaheim positioned directly overhead | Vanaheim borders Midgard as **adjacent continent** |
| **Alfheim ↔ Midgard** | Alfheim positioned directly overhead | Alfheim hidden atop Vanaheim or connected to Asgard |
| **Canopy Sea ↔ Sun** | Canopy Sea blocks sun visibility | Sun **visible** through ash-filled atmosphere |

This is the most significant correction from v4.0 to v5.0.

The original (incorrect) model placed Vanaheim and Alfheim as overhead "canopy" layers blocking Midgard's view of the sun. This created narrative problems:
- Midgardians would never see daylight
- The "Canopy Sea" would dominate all outdoor descriptions
- Sun-based mythology and agriculture would be impossible

The corrected model establishes Vanaheim and Alfheim as **laterally adjacent** to Midgard—massive continental structures to the side, not above. This preserves:
- Sun visibility from Midgard (through ash-filled atmosphere)
- Logical agricultural development in Midgard settlements
- Distinct "frontier" relationship between realms

### Sun Visibility from Midgard

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Sun visible from Midgard | ✅ CANONICAL |
| Atmosphere quality | Ash-filled, hazy, but not opaque |
| Daylight cycle | Present (though dimmed) |
| Astronomical observation | Limited but possible |

Midgardians can see the sun. It rises and sets. It provides light and warmth. The ash from 800 years of infrastructural decay dims it, but does not block it.

This is **essential** to the setting's agricultural economy and mythological framework.

### Vertical Stack (Infrastructure Layers)

| Position | Realm | Relationship to Midgard |
|----------|-------|------------------------|
| **Above** | Asgard (orbital) | Overhead, causing Asgardian Scar impact site |
| **Lateral** | Vanaheim | Adjacent continent (not overhead) |
| **Lateral/Connected** | Alfheim | Atop Vanaheim or connected to Asgard |
| **Below** | Jötunheim | Sub-Midgard infrastructure layer |
| **Below** | Svartalfheim | Deep fabrication layer |
| **Below** | Muspelheim | Geothermal power layer |
| **Below** | Helheim | Waste reclamation layer |
| **Below** | Niflheim | Cryo-storage layer |

The sub-Midgard realms (Jötunheim, Svartalfheim, Muspelheim, Helheim, Niflheim) form the **infrastructure layers** beneath the habitation deck. These are vertically stacked by design—the "roots" and "trunk" of the world-machine.

## The Deep: Subterranean Network

### Definition

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Nature** | Subterranean network beneath all decks |
| **Structure** | Interconnected cavern systems, collapsed infrastructure, unmapped tunnels |
| **Relationship** | Runs **beneath** the Deck structure (not a separate realm) |
| **Inhabitants** | Silent Folk, Deep-Stalkers, Dvergr frontier operations |

The Deep is not a tenth realm. It is the **connective tissue** between realms—the collapsed infrastructure corridors, natural cavern systems, and unmapped subterranean networks that exist beneath and between the formal Deck structure.

### Depth Stratification

| Stratum | Depth | Characteristics |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Upper Deep** | 0-500m below Deck floors | Accessible; some infrastructure intact |
| **Middle Deep** | 500-2000m | Dangerous; structural instability; fauna |
| **Lower Deep** | 2000m+ | Unmapped; Silent Folk territory; absolute darkness |

---

## Transport Systems: The Bifröst

### Original Function

| System | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Vertical Lift** | High-energy particle lift through the Spire for inter-Deck transit |
| **Horizontal Gates** | Local teleportation gateways for intra-Deck travel |
| **Structural Function** | Energy fields stabilized physical Deck positioning |

The Bifröst Bridge was not a single bridge but the **entire transport network** of the Yggdrasil megastructure.

### POST-Glitch State

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Vertical Lift** | Destroyed; fragments occasionally operational |
| **Horizontal Gates** | Shattered; unpredictable; often one-way |
| **Structural Function** | Lost; Decks now physically collapsed into stacked configuration |

The Glitch destroyed the Bifröst network. Travel between realms is now a **perilous, physical journey** through collapsed infrastructure, not a step through a gate.

## Compliance Examples

### Realm Descriptions

**✅ COMPLIANT:**
> "The Muspelheim Forge biome features geothermal vents from the infrastructure layer beneath Midgard, their heat radiating upward through intentionally designed thermal shafts."

**❌ NON-COMPLIANT:**
> "The Muspelheim orbital fragment crashed into the Aethelgard stack, its random positioning creating unpredictable thermal zones."

### Spatial Relationships

**✅ COMPLIANT:**
> "Vanaheim stretches to the east of Midgard's settled territories, a massive continental jungle visible on the horizon—a green wall of cancerous growth that marks the frontier."

**❌ NON-COMPLIANT:**
> "Vanaheim hangs overhead, its Canopy Sea blocking the sun and casting Midgard in perpetual twilight."

### Sun Visibility

**✅ COMPLIANT:**
> "Through the ash-filled atmosphere, the sun rose over the Asgardian Scar—dimmed but visible, its light filtering through eight centuries of accumulated particulates."

**❌ NON-COMPLIANT:**
> "The Canopy Sea above blocked all natural light, forcing Midgardians to rely on artificial illumination for all outdoor activities."

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the beginning, the gods planted a seed in the void, and from that seed grew Yggdrasil—the World Tree whose roots drink from the fires of creation and whose branches hold the Nine Realms in their eternal embrace. Midgard, where mortals dwell, lies in the heart of the Tree, blessed by the sun that filters through its leaves. To the east stretches Vanaheim, the Verdant Hell, where the old gods' gardens have grown wild and hungry. Above, the shattered corpse of Asgard bleeds light and madness upon the Scar. Below, in the roots, the deep realms labor in darkness—the forges, the ice-vaults, the poison-pits where the world's corruption pools and festers. This is the shape of creation: a tree of iron and stone, dead but still standing, its branches home to the survivors of the gods' last mistake."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"Domain 1 establishes the foundational spatial logic of POST-Glitch Aethelgard. The Yggdrasil Network—a planetary-scale arcology comprising nine distinct Deck layers—was not randomly assembled from crashed orbital bodies but intentionally designed as an integrated habitat system. Contemporary spatial relationships reflect both original design intent and catastrophic structural collapse during the Ginnungagap Glitch. Critical correction from v4.0 archives: Vanaheim and Alfheim are positioned laterally adjacent to Midgard, not overhead. This preserves sun visibility through the ash-filled atmosphere and explains agricultural viability in Midgard settlements. Sub-Midgard realms (Jötunheim, Svartalfheim, Muspelheim, Helheim, Niflheim) form genuine infrastructure layers beneath the habitation deck. The Deep represents subterranean networks beneath formal Deck structure, not a separate realm."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"YGGDRASIL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE: Deck-based planetary megastructure. CONFIGURATION: 9 continent-sized structural tiers (realms) in designed vertical/lateral arrangement. DECK HIERARCHY: Asgard (01/orbital), Alfheim (02/research), Vanaheim (03/bio), Midgard (04-05/habitation), Jötunheim (05/industrial), Svartalfheim (06/fabrication), Niflheim (07/cryo), Muspelheim (08/geothermal), Helheim (09/waste). SPATIAL CORRECTION: Vanaheim/Alfheim = lateral to Midgard (not overhead); sun visibility preserved. SUB-MIDGARD LAYERS: Infrastructure stack by design. THE DEEP: Subterranean connective network beneath Deck floors. BIFRÖST STATUS: Transport network destroyed; inter-realm travel = physical journey. VALIDATION REQUIREMENT: All geographic content must maintain canonical spatial relationships."*

## Summary

Domain 1 answers the fundamental question: **What is Aethelgard?**

The answer is precise:

Aethelgard is the **Yggdrasil Network**—a planetary-scale megastructure comprising nine continent-sized structural tiers, designed during the Age of Forging to serve as the eternal home of the Aesir civilization.

It is not a world of magic and myth. It is a **machine**—the largest machine ever built, now broken beyond repair.

The Nine Realms are not parallel dimensions or disconnected landmasses. They are the **Decks** of this machine:
- Asgard overhead, its crash creating the Scar
- Vanaheim and Alfheim **adjacent**, not blocking the sun
- Midgard at the center, where survivors rebuilt
- The infrastructure layers below, still grinding in the dark

The Bifröst that once connected all realms is shattered. Travel between Decks is no longer instantaneous—it is a dangerous physical journey through collapsed corridors and hostile territory.

This is the architecture of a broken world.

And Domain 1 ensures that every piece of canonical content accurately represents its designed—not random—configuration.

> *"Yggdrasil is not a tree that the world was built upon. The world itself, in its entirety, is the tree.*

> *And the tree is dead.*

> *But the survivors still live in its branches, clinging to the bark of a corpse the size of a planet, waiting for the roots to finally give way."*
