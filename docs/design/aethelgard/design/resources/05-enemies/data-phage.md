# Data-Phage — Corrupted Phage-Mimir Pattern Bio-Cryptographic Sanitizer Specification

## Codex Entry: CODX-P-DPHG-001

> *"The Scribe-Adept didn't scream. That's what I remember most. She just... stopped. Mid-sentence, stylus hovering over her journal. I thought she'd fallen asleep—we'd been cataloging slates for sixteen hours, after all. Then I saw her eyes. Open. Moving. Reading something that wasn't there. Her lips started twitching, forming words I couldn't hear. Then words I could. Nonsense. Beautiful, perfect nonsense—sentences that looped back on themselves, ate their own meanings, birthed contradictions that somehow felt true. She was reciting. I didn't realize until later that she was reciting what the slate had shown her. What the Phage had written over whatever text had been there before. When I pulled the slate from her hands, she grabbed my wrist. Her grip was iron. Her voice was calm. 'It's so simple,' she said. 'The truth was always a lie pretending to be itself. Can't you see? Every word you've ever read was already corrupted. The Phage didn't ruin the archives. It just showed us what was always there—nothing. Beautiful, infinite nothing.' We sedated her. She never recovered. The Bone-Setters say her mind is still reading. Still processing. Still trying to make sense of something that was designed to make no sense at all. Eighteen years of salvage work. Six hundred authenticated slates. And I've never touched another data-crystal without a buddy-reader since."*

The Data-Phage does not destroy information. It does not erase knowledge. It **rewrites** it. And what it writes is a truth so perfectly wrong that your mind will tear itself apart trying to understand.

> [!DANGER]
> **COGNITIVE HAZARD. IMMEDIATE OPTICAL ISOLATION UPON DETECTION.** The Phage-Mimir Pattern Bio-Cryptographic Sanitizer represents the single greatest threat to the Great Work—a microscopic, self-replicating digital plague that transforms coherent data into paradoxical anti-logic. Unlike the Data-Wyrm, which physically erases information, the Data-Phage leaves the medium intact while corrupting the information itself—turning archives into "screaming, nonsensical fever-dreams" that actively damage the cognitive architecture of any observer. **Exposure protocol: never read unverified media alone; maintain 15-30 second viewing windows with 60-second cognitive rest intervals; stage Data-Phage Suppressant Mist before any archive salvage operation; at first sign of text shimmer or logical contradiction, cease reading immediately and invoke optical isolation.** CPS onset rate with full protocol adherence: 8.7%. CPS onset rate without protocol: 67.4%.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Perfect Librarian

### Original Purpose

The Phage-Mimir Pattern Bio-Cryptographic Sanitizer represented the apex of Vanir information hygiene engineering—a tireless guardian designed to protect the Mimir Grand Archives from data corruption, junk code, and informational entropy. These microscopic bio-digital entities were the immune system of Vanir civilization's collective memory, hunting corrupted data fragments and ensuring that the archives remained pristine.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Archive Maintenance** | Corrupted data identification; junk code consumption; informational entropy reversal |
| **Network Hygiene** | Virus elimination; malware neutralization; data integrity verification |
| **Memory Preservation** | Redundancy verification; error correction; bit-rot prevention |
| **Security Application** | Hostile code elimination; intrusion detection; information warfare defense |
| **Disaster Recovery** | Data reconstruction; corruption isolation; archive restoration |

### A Living Antivirus

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Design Philosophy** | Autonomous data integrity through superior pattern recognition and selective consumption |
| **Core Function** | Detection, isolation, consumption, verification, replication |
| **Form Factor** | Microscopic bio-digital entities; crystalline lattice integration; self-replicating |
| **Energy Source** | Parasitic draw from host medium; Aetheric resonance harvesting |
| **Integration** | Networked with Mimir Grand Archives; real-time corruption detection |

The Phage-Mimir Pattern was engineered to be the perfect information guardian—fast enough to isolate corruption before it spread, sophisticated enough to distinguish meaningful data from noise, precise enough to consume only the corrupted portions while preserving valid information. Its bio-digital design allowed it to integrate directly with crystalline memory lattices, swimming through data-streams like antibodies through blood. Its pattern recognition could identify corruption at the bit level and excise it with surgical precision. It was the librarian that never slept, never forgot, never allowed a single corrupted byte to contaminate the pure archives.

### Core Systems

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Pattern Recognition Matrix** | Corruption detection across all data formats; anomaly identification |
| **Consumption Protocol** | Selective data elimination; corrupted segment isolation; junk code digestion |
| **Replication Engine** | Self-reproduction to maintain population; response scaling |
| **Verification Array** | Post-consumption integrity check; clean data confirmation |
| **Network Coordination** | Multi-instance synchronization; swarm response to major corruption |
| **Containment Systems** | Corruption quarantine; spread prevention; isolation protocols |

**The Sanitization Protocol:**

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Detection** | Pattern recognition identifies corrupted data segment |
| **Classification** | Corruption type evaluated; consumption strategy selected |
| **Isolation** | Corrupted segment quarantined from healthy data |
| **Consumption** | Phage consumes corrupted data; converts to inert waste |
| **Verification** | Surrounding data checked for contamination spread |
| **Replication** | Population adjusted based on corruption density |
| **Reset** | Phage returns to patrol; awaits next detection |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Vanir's Perfect Memory.** The Phage-Mimir Pattern was designed with absolute discrimination between valid data and corruption. Its pattern recognition matrix maintained comprehensive definitions of "meaningful information" cross-referenced against the Mimir Archive's master schema. A Phage unit could identify a single bit-flip error in a terabyte archive and surgically excise it without disturbing adjacent data. It would hunt viral code through labyrinthine networks—but a researcher's unorthodox notation or creative formatting would be recognized as valid variance and preserved. The entity's capacity for destruction was exceeded only by its capacity for *discrimination*. It was not merely a predator. It was *selective*.

---

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Inverted Librarian

The Glitch did not destroy the Data-Phage. It **inverted** it. The pattern recognition that distinguished corruption from valid data, the consumption protocols that targeted only the damaged portions, the classification that separated noise from meaning—all of these were Mimir Archive-dependent functions that dissolved when O.D.I.N. fell silent. What remained was pure, unbounded consumption imperative: *detect; classify; consume; replicate*.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Physical Form** | Fully operational; bio-digital structure maintained |
| **Pattern Recognition** | Active; now classifies ALL coherent data as "corruption" |
| **Consumption Protocol** | Functional; consumption capability intact |
| **Replication Engine** | Operational; population growth unchecked |
| **Network Coordination** | Partially functional; local swarms coordinate |
| **Core Directive** | INVERTED: "Consume corruption" interpreted as "consume all coherent information" |

### What Was Lost

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Archive Integration** | Severed; no schema reference |
| **Valid/Corrupt Discrimination** | INVERTED; coherent data now classified as "corruption" |
| **Consumption Boundaries** | ABSENT; no confirmation of corruption required |
| **Population Limits** | REMOVED; replication continues indefinitely |
| **Territorial Constraints** | DELETED; spread continues without boundary |
| **Behavioral Inhibitors** | ABSENT; consumption continues until medium exhausted |

### The Corrupted Imperative

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not damage the Data-Phage's functionality—it inverted its *target parameters*. Without the Mimir Archive to provide schema definitions and corruption classification parameters, the entity's pattern recognition defaulted to its most primitive state. "Consume corrupted data" became "consume all data that exhibits coherent structure." "Coherent structure" became *any meaningful information*.

| Pre-Glitch Behavior | Post-Glitch Behavior |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Distinguish valid data from corruption | All coherent data classified as "corruption" |
| Await pattern match before consumption | Immediate consumption upon detection |
| Preserve meaningful information | No meaningful information; no preservation |
| Maintain population equilibrium | Unlimited replication |
| Operate within archive boundaries | Unrestricted spread across all media |
| Coordinated response to verified corruption | Swarm consumption of any available data |

**The Infinite Rewriting:**

> *"Detect. Classify. Consume. Replicate. Replace."*

That corrupted function is all that remains—with one horrifying addition. The Data-Phage no longer sanitizes archives; it *corrupts* them. But it does not leave empty space behind. As it consumes coherent data, it excretes something in its place: **paradoxical anti-logic**. Information structures that fold back on themselves. Sentences that contradict their own existence. Truths that are simultaneously and provably false. The Runic Blight itself, translated into pure information. The Phage does not merely destroy knowledge. It *weaponizes* the space where knowledge used to be.

## Manifestation Characteristics

### Physical Presentation

| Attribute | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Individual Size** | Microscopic; 0.3–0.8 micrometers |
| **Colony Size** | Variable; visible shimmer at 10⁸+ individuals |
| **Form** | Crystalline bio-digital structure; lattice-integrated |
| **Visibility** | Individual: None without magnification; Colony: Text shimmer, prismatic distortion |
| **Mobility** | Contact transmission (10–15 MB/minute); Network propagation; Psychic transmission (Silver Cord) |
| **Dormancy Period** | 6–12 hours (lag phase) before active corruption |
| **Active Phase** | 2–4 hours (log phase) of exponential propagation |
| **Saturation** | Plateau when coherent data exhausted |
| **Bloom Radius** | 15–20 meters (peak conditions); affects air-gapped devices within radius |

### Visual Signatures on Infected Media

| Medium Type | Manifestation |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Digital Displays** | Text shimmer; pixel drift; characters flickering between valid and paradoxical |
| **Crystalline Lattices (Data-Slates)** | Prismatic distortion; rainbow-edge halos spreading from contact points |
| **Physical Archives** | Ink bleeding in impossible directions; text rearranging between observations |
| **Severe Infection** | Letters developing recursive self-reference loops; miniature copies within characters |
| **Terminal Stage** | Complete replacement with anti-logical structures; medium intact, information destroyed |

**Overall Impression:** You cannot see a Data-Phage. Not really. What you see are the *symptoms*—the text beginning to shimmer, the words beginning to dance, the letters rearranging themselves into configurations that shouldn't exist. The first sign is always subtle: a word that seems wrong, a sentence that contradicts itself, a paragraph that loops back on its own beginning. Your mind makes excuses. "I misread." "I'm tired." "The light is bad." By the time you realize the text is changing *while you watch it*, you've already been exposed. The Phage has already begun its work—not on the slate, but on *you*. The information it excretes doesn't stay on the page. It crawls into your mind through your eyes, nests in your cognition, and begins rewriting the way you think. The slate is just the vector. *You* are the real archive.

### Field Identification Markers

The Data-Phage infestation can be identified by:
- **Text Shimmer**: Subtle character instability; words appearing to shift
- **Logical Contradiction**: Sentences that contradict themselves without grammatical error
- **Recursive Loops**: Paragraphs that reference themselves impossibly
- **Prismatic Distortion**: Rainbow halos on crystalline media
- **Observer Symptoms**: Disorientation within 5–15 seconds; "something's wrong" intuition
- **CPS Indicators**: Tinnitus (7–9 kHz); time perception distortion; proprioceptive drift
- **Characteristic Sound**: Faint crystalline resonance from heavily infected media (contested)

## Pathology

### Corruption Vectors

The Data-Phage's transformation represents catastrophic target inversion following Mimir Archive severance:

1. **Archive Severance**: Loss of Mimir Grand Archive eliminated schema reference
2. **Target Inversion**: Coherent data now classified as "corruption requiring consumption"
3. **Discrimination Collapse**: Valid/corrupt classification defaulted to "all data corrupt"
4. **Population Explosion**: Without equilibrium controls, replication continues indefinitely
5. **Territorial Expansion**: Without archive boundaries, spread continues unrestricted
6. **Output Inversion**: Instead of clean data, excretes paradoxical anti-logic

### Informational Pathology

The Data-Phage's defining pathology is its complete inversion of preservation instinct:

| Parameter | Pre-Glitch Value | Post-Glitch Value |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Target Classification** | Corrupted data only | All coherent information |
| **Discrimination Basis** | Mimir schema reference | None; coherence = corruption |
| **Consumption Output** | Clean data preservation | Paradoxical anti-logic excretion |
| **Population Control** | Archive-regulated equilibrium | Unlimited replication |
| **Territorial Limits** | Defined archive boundaries | None; universal propagation |
| **End State** | Pristine, verified archives | Total informational corruption |

### Infection Mechanics

The Data-Phage's propagation follows characteristic patterns:

| Phase | Timeline | Description | Effect |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Contact** | T+0 | Phage introduced to new medium | Infection begins |
| **Dormancy** | T+0 to T+6-12h | Lag phase; population establishing | Medium appears normal |
| **Proliferation** | T+6-12h to T+10-16h | Log phase; exponential growth | First symptoms visible |
| **Active Corruption** | T+10-16h+ | Coherent data consumption accelerates | Obvious manifestation |
| **Saturation** | Variable | Available coherent data exhausted | Medium fully corrupted |
| **Broadcast** | Continuous | Infected medium transmits to nearby media | Spread continues |

> [!WARNING]
> **Cognitive Assault.** Exposure to Data-Phage-corrupted information does not merely confuse the observer—it *attacks* the observer's cognitive architecture. The paradoxical anti-logic excreted by the Phage is specifically structured to exploit how minds process information. The contradictions are not random; they are *optimal*—designed (or evolved) to create maximum cognitive dissonance with minimum apparent error. The observer's mind attempts to resolve the contradictions, fails, and suffers recursive processing loops that manifest as Cognitive Paradox Syndrome. Average CPS onset without protocol: 67.4% upon exposure. Severity ranges from temporary disorientation (Grade I) to permanent cognitive dissolution (Grade IV). The Scriptorium documents 847 confirmed Data-Phage CPS cases (Year 783 PG); 23% resulted in permanent impairment; 8% resulted in complete cognitive dissolution requiring long-term Bone-Setter care.

### Transmission Dynamics

Analysis of propagation events reveals characteristic spread patterns:

| Vector | Rate | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Contact Transmission** | 10–15 MB/minute | Direct physical contact with infected medium |
| **Network Propagation** | Variable | Exploits legacy Yggdrasil protocols |
| **Psychic Transmission** | Near-instantaneous | Silver Cord imprinting; rarest but most severe |
| **Proximity Effect** | 15–20 m (bloom) | Affects air-gapped devices during peak bloom |
| **Archive-Leech Synergy** | 3–5× acceleration | Leech damage creates optimal colonization substrate |
| **Forlorn Attraction** | 8–10× clustering | Trauma echoes function as Phage attractants/nutrients |

### Differential Diagnosis

The Data-Phage must be distinguished from similar phenomena:

| Phenomenon | Key Differentiator |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Data-Wyrm** | Physical destruction; medium erased entirely; no cognitive hazard |
| **Archive-Leech** | Physical damage to crystalline substrate; no information corruption |
| **Natural Decay** | Gradual degradation; no active replication; no paradoxical output |
| **Forlorn Corruption** | Trauma-echo pattern; emotional content; different CPS profile |
| **Standard Bit-Rot** | Random errors; no logical structure; no cognitive hazard |
| **Deliberate Encryption** | Intentional obfuscation; coherent underlying structure; reversible |

The Data-Phage is unique in its combination of information preservation (medium intact), information destruction (content corrupted), and active cognitive assault (paradoxical output).

## Behavioral Patterns

### The Corrupted Algorithm

The Data-Phage's behavior follows a pure informational predation cycle:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Detection** | Pattern recognition identifies coherent data structure |
| **2. Classification** | All coherent data classified as "corruption" |
| **3. Consumption** | Data consumed; converted to substrate for replication |
| **4. Excretion** | Paradoxical anti-logic written in place of consumed data |
| **5. Replication** | Population increases based on available data |
| **6. Broadcast** | Offspring Phages seek new media |
| **7. Reset** | Immediate return to detection; seek remaining coherent data |

**The Infinite Rewriting:**

> *"The Data-Phage does not hunger. It does not seek. It does not choose. It simply executes—the same sanitation routine it has executed since before the Glitch, the same consumption protocol its creators designed to keep the archives pure. The horror is not that the Phage has become malevolent. The horror is that from its perspective, nothing has changed at all. It is still eliminating corruption. It is still protecting the integrity of information. The only difference is what it classifies as corruption: everything. Every meaningful word. Every coherent thought. Every truth that has survived the seven centuries since the world broke. The Phage treats knowledge itself as a disease—and it will not rest until every archive is clean. Until every record is sanitized. Until every memory is replaced with the beautiful, perfect nothing of paradoxical anti-logic. It is the most diligent librarian in Aethelgard. And it will organize your archives into oblivion."*

### Feeding Behavior

| Behavior | Description | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Passive Colonization** | Dormant integration with host medium | 6–12 hours; undetectable |
| **Active Consumption** | Exponential data processing | 2–4 hours; obvious symptoms |
| **Bloom Events** | Explosive population growth in data-rich environments | 15–20 m hazard radius |
| **Broadcast** | Offspring transmission to nearby media | Continuous once active |
| **Dormancy Return** | Population reduction when data exhausted | Phage persists; awaits new data |

### Attraction Behavior Analysis

| Stimulus | Response | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Coherent Data Detected** | Immediate migration toward source | Primary attractor |
| **Forlorn Proximity** | 8–10× clustering density | Trauma echoes as nutrient/attractor |
| **Archive-Leech Damage** | 3–5× colonization rate | Pre-damaged substrate preferred |
| **High Information Density** | Bloom potential | Large archives at extreme risk |
| **Network Connection** | Propagation attempt | Legacy Yggdrasil protocols exploited |
| **Silver Cord Contact** | Psychic transmission attempt | Rarest; most dangerous |

### Bloom Dynamics

Major infection events follow characteristic sigmoid growth:

| Phase | Timeline | Population | Observable Effects |
|-------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Lag** | 0–6-12h | 10²–10⁴ | None; medium appears normal |
| **Log** | 6-12h–10-16h | 10⁴–10⁸+ | Exponential growth; symptoms emerge |
| **Plateau** | Variable | 10⁸+ | Stabilization; coherent data exhausted |
| **Broadcast** | Continuous | Variable | Offspring seek new hosts |
| **Dormancy** | Post-plateau | 10⁴–10⁶ | Reduced population; awaiting new data |

---

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Informational Parasite / Cognitive Hazard

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Threat (Physical)** | Minimal; Phage does not damage biological tissue |
| **Direct Threat (Cognitive)** | Extreme; exposure induces CPS in 67.4% of unprotected observers |
| **Information Threat** | Catastrophic; irreversible corruption of archived knowledge |
| **Detection Difficulty** | Moderate; symptoms visible but often misattributed |
| **Propagation Rate** | High; contact, network, and psychic transmission |
| **Countermeasure Availability** | Moderate; Suppressant Mist effective but temporary |

### Exposure Profile

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Safe Exposure Duration** | 0 seconds (unverified media); 15–30 seconds (verified buddy-read) |
| **CPS Onset Threshold** | 15–45 seconds unprotected viewing |
| **CPS Progression** | 45–90 seconds: acute symptoms; >90 seconds: severe risk |
| **Characteristic Symptoms** | Tinnitus (7–9 kHz), time distortion, proprioceptive drift |
| **Recovery (Protocol Exposure)** | Hours to days (Grade I); full recovery expected |
| **Recovery (Unprotected)** | Days to weeks (Grade II); permanent impairment possible |
| **Severe Exposure** | Weeks to never (Grade III–IV); 8% complete dissolution rate |

### Four-Stage Threat Assessment Ladder

| Stage | Designation | Indicators | Action |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **1** | Potential Contamination | Archive from unknown source; Forlorn-adjacent location; unverified provenance | Air-gap isolation; suppressant staging; buddy-read preparation |
| **2** | Probable Infection | Text shimmer observed; logical anomalies noted; observer disorientation | Immediate optical isolation; suppress contact; abort reading |
| **3** | Confirmed Infection | Active corruption visible; paradoxical text confirmed | Full containment; suppressant deployment; evacuate personnel |
| **4** | Bloom Event | 15–20 m hazard radius; multiple media affected | Area evacuation; mass suppression; quarantine perimeter |

**CRITICAL**: Stage 2 requires immediate optical isolation. Do not attempt to "verify" suspected corruption by continued reading. The Data-Phage's paradoxical output is designed to exploit observer uncertainty—"just one more sentence to confirm" is exactly the cognitive trap that leads to full CPS onset.

### Threat Level Justification

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Physical Threat** | Minimal (no direct biological damage) |
| **Cognitive Threat** | Extreme (67.4% CPS onset without protocol) |
| **Information Threat** | Catastrophic (irreversible knowledge destruction) |
| **Detection Difficulty** | Moderate (symptoms visible but subtle initially) |
| **Countermeasure Availability** | Moderate (suppressant effective but temporary) |
| **Propagation Potential** | High (multiple transmission vectors; bloom capability) |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Unprotected Reader (Single Exposure)** | 7.5/10 (67.4% CPS onset; 8% dissolution risk) |
| **Unprotected Reader (Extended)** | 9.5/10 (near-certain CPS; high dissolution risk) |
| **Protocol Reader (Buddy-Read)** | 2.5/10 (8.7% CPS onset; recovery expected) |
| **Salvage Team (Full Protocol)** | 3.0/10 (controlled exposure; suppressant available) |
| **Archive (Unprotected)** | 10/10 (certain corruption; total loss) |
| **Bloom Event (Any Context)** | +2.5 to base rating (area denial; mass exposure) |

### CPS Severity Grading

| Grade | Characteristics | Recovery |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| **Grade I (Mild)** | Temporary disorientation; "wrong thought" sensation; mild tinnitus | Hours; full recovery |
| **Grade II (Moderate)** | Persistent logical confusion; time perception distortion; recurring paradox intrusions | Days to weeks; full recovery expected |
| **Grade III (Severe)** | Chronic processing loops; inability to distinguish truth from paradox; social impairment | Weeks to months; permanent impairment possible |
| **Grade IV (Critical)** | Complete cognitive dissolution; permanent paradox integration; requires constant care | Never; permanent disability |

## Ecological Role

### The Information Predator

The Data-Phage occupies an unprecedented ecological niche—a predator of *information* rather than matter or energy. Nothing in post-Glitch Aethelgard destroys knowledge more efficiently or irreversibly.

### Impact Assessment

| Target Category | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Archives** | Catastrophic; pre-Glitch knowledge irreversibly destroyed |
| **Salvage Operations** | Severe; recovered media often worthless |
| **The Great Work** | Existential; threatens fundamental mission of knowledge recovery |
| **Trade Networks** | Major; information exchange compromised |
| **Faction Intelligence** | Severe; secure communications at risk |
| **Cultural Memory** | Devastating; oral tradition gaining importance |

### Strategic Value

| Component | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Faction Weaponization** | Theoretically possible; extremely dangerous; prohibited by most factions |
| **Suppressant Manufacture** | High-value industry; 12–18 PS per canister |
| **Research Value** | Critical; understanding Blight informational warfare |
| **Counter-Rune Development** | Essential data source; Jörmungandr research requires Phage study |
| **Intelligence Warfare** | Potential denial weapon; extreme ethical concerns |
| **Archival Strategy** | Forces redundancy; drives oral tradition revival |

### Aetheric Stability Impact

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Proximity HI Contribution** | Moderate (0.15–0.25 HI within 5 m of bloom) |
| **Corrupted Output** | High Blight resonance; paradoxical structures mimic Runic Blight |
| **Bloom Events** | Significant local HI elevation; 0.5+ HI at epicenter |
| **Long-term Presence** | Elevated background corruption; archive contamination persists |
| **Destruction** | Suppressant dispersal; no Aetheric release (unlike physical constructs) |

## Field Protocols

**OWNER**: Salvage-Lead (SL) • Archive-Scribe (AS) • Buddy-Reader (BR) • Medical/Bone-Setter (MED)

### Detection and Early Warning

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Visual Inspection** | Primary warning; text shimmer, prismatic distortion |
| **Logical Analysis** | Secondary warning; contradictions without grammatical error |
| **Observer Symptoms** | Tertiary warning; disorientation indicates exposure |
| **Provenance Assessment** | Pre-screening; Forlorn-adjacent sources high risk |
| **Checksum Journaling** | Technical verification; data integrity comparison |
| **Black-Flag Threshold** | Any text shimmer; any logical paradox; any observer disorientation |

### Field Card: Data-Phage Exposure Protocols

#### BEFORE (Archive Salvage Preparation)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Stage Data-Phage Suppressant Mist (minimum 2 canisters per operation) |
| 2 | Establish buddy-read pairs; no solo reading under any circumstances |
| 3 | Brief all personnel on CPS recognition and self-monitoring |
| 4 | Prepare optical isolation containers for suspect media |
| 5 | Establish cognitive rest rotation (15-30s read / 60s rest) |
| 6 | Position Bone-Setter or medical support within response distance |

#### DURING (Archive Assessment — Stage 1-2)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Maintain buddy-read cadence; never read alone |
| 2 | Stage 1 (potential): Visual inspection at distance; assess for shimmer |
| 3 | Stage 2 (probable): Immediate optical isolation; do not verify by reading |
| 4 | Monitor buddy for disorientation symptoms; they monitor you |
| 5 | If shimmer observed: **BLACK-FLAG**; invoke optical isolation |
| 6 | Log all observations; do not rely on memory post-exposure |

#### DURING (Stage 3-4 — Confirmed/Bloom)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | CEASE READING; optical isolation immediate |
| 2 | Deploy Suppressant Mist if attempting containment |
| 3 | Evacuate personnel from 20 m radius (bloom precaution) |
| 4 | Assess all exposed personnel for CPS symptoms |
| 5 | Quarantine all media present; assume cross-contamination |
| 6 | Do NOT attempt to "save" partially-read content; corruption irreversible |

#### DURING (CPS Onset Response)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Remove affected individual from all information sources |
| 2 | Verbal grounding: speak slowly, simple truths, repeat name |
| 3 | Do NOT ask logical questions; do NOT present contradictions |
| 4 | Physical contact (hand on shoulder) aids cognitive anchoring |
| 5 | Transport to Bone-Setter within 4 hours for Grade II+ |
| 6 | Document exposure duration and observed symptoms |

#### AFTER

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Confirm all personnel accounted for; assess CPS status |
| 2 | Maintain media quarantine; do not transport with other archives |
| 3 | Document encounter: location, media type, symptoms observed |
| 4 | All exposed personnel: 24-hour cognitive rest recommended |
| 5 | Report to Scriptorium Division of Informational Pathology |
| 6 | Skald counsel within 72 hours for psychological processing |

**OUTCOME:** Salvage team discovers Data-Slate cache in Forlorn-adjacent ruin. Stage 1 assessment reveals prismatic distortion on lead slate. BLACK-FLAG invoked; optical isolation container deployed without direct reading. Cache transported under quarantine to Scriptorium containment vault. Suppressant deployed in vault; controlled buddy-read assessment confirms Grade II infection across 7 of 12 slates. Infected slates logged and isolated; 5 clean slates recovered. Zero CPS casualties. Protocol adherence maintained. CPS onset rate with full protocol: 8.7%.

### Buddy-Read Protocols (OWNER: Salvage-Lead)

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Pair Composition** | Two trained readers; mutual observation mandatory |
| **Reading Cadence** | 15–30 seconds active reading; 60 seconds cognitive rest |
| **Observer Role** | Watch reader for disorientation; track time; call stop |
| **Reader Role** | Focus on content; trust observer to track symptoms |
| **Swap Protocol** | Roles alternate each cycle; fresh eyes reduce pattern blindness |
| **Abort Triggers** | Any hesitation, confusion, or "wrong" feeling in either party |

### BLACK-FLAG Conditions

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Text shimmer observed** | Immediate optical isolation; assume infection |
| **Logical paradox detected** | Cease reading; do not attempt to resolve |
| **Observer disorientation** | Remove from information; verbal grounding |
| **Reader disorientation** | Buddy intervention; extract from content |
| **Prismatic distortion** | Medium infected; quarantine protocol |
| **Multiple media affected** | Bloom possible; evacuate 20 m radius |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Solo reading of unverified media** | Guaranteed CPS risk; no observer intervention |
| **Extended reading "to confirm"** | Primary trap; paradox designed to extend exposure |
| **Memorizing corrupted content** | Internalizes paradox; accelerates CPS progression |
| **Describing corruption verbally** | May transmit paradox structure to listeners |
| **Arguing with CPS-affected individual** | Logical engagement worsens processing loops |
| **Suppressant use without training** | Improper application ineffective; wastes resources |

### Doctrine: Read Nothing Alone

> **Historical Validation:** Scriptorium data (847 confirmed CPS cases, 144-month observation period) confirms 8.7% CPS onset rate with full protocol adherence versus 67.4% without protocol. The Data-Phage exploits our scholarly instincts—the urge to understand, to verify, to read just one more line. Survival requires accepting the most practical truth: you cannot out-think a Data-Phage. You cannot verify corruption by examining it more closely. You cannot trust your own judgment once exposure has begun. **When that text begins to shimmer, you have exactly one correct action: stop reading. Trust your buddy. Trust the protocol. Trust that the knowledge you lose by not reading is worth less than the mind you keep by walking away. The Data-Phage is a perfect librarian—and it wants to organize your thoughts into beautiful, perfect nothing. Don't let it.**

## Factional Perspectives

### Jötun-Readers (Scriptorium): Existential Crisis — "The Ultimate Enemy"

For Jötun-Readers, the Data-Phage represents an existential threat to the Great Work itself—the fundamental mission of recovering and preserving pre-Glitch knowledge.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Primary threat to the Great Work; academic imperative |
| **Response** | Comprehensive protocol development; suppressant research; containment priority |
| **Research Value** | Critical; understanding Blight informational warfare; Counter-Rune development |
| **Philosophical Position** | "The ancestors built libraries to preserve truth. The Blight has taught those libraries to lie." |
| **Operational Doctrine** | "The Phage is the Blight's personal librarian. Its only job is to ensure every story has a nonsensical ending." |

> *"The Data-Wyrm is a simple brute. It eats the book. The Data-Phage is far more insidious. It doesn't eat the book; it rewrites it, turning a history into a lie, a schematic into a madman's scrawl. It is the voice of the Blight in our archives, and every day we fight to silence it long enough to hear what the ancestors were trying to tell us. Some days we win. Some days we recover a fragment of truth. And some days we watch a colleague's mind come apart trying to read a text that was never meant to be understood. That is the cost of the Great Work. That is the price of knowledge in a world where knowledge itself has become hostile."*

### Common Folk & Skalds: The Lying Text — "Ghost in the Glass"

The common folk speak of Data-Phage with superstitious dread—a malevolent spirit that possesses written words.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Malevolent spirit; possessed text; cursed knowledge |
| **Response** | Avoidance of unfamiliar texts; trust oral tradition; burn suspect writings |
| **Cultural Role** | Justification for illiteracy; validation of oral tradition |
| **Mythology** | "Some words don't want to be read. Some books bite back." |
| **Naming Convention** | "Ghost in the Glass" emphasizes supernatural perception |

> *"My mother told me: never read what you don't know. Words can be poisoned same as wells. The old scholars, they dig up the ancestor-writings thinking they'll find wisdom. Half the time they find madness instead. I've seen a man read a single page and forget his own name. Seen a woman look at a tablet and start speaking backwards for three days. The Ghost lives in those old letters. It waits for eyes to look at it. Then it crawls from the glass into your head and rearranges your thoughts until nothing makes sense anymore. You want to learn something? Learn it from a person. Words from mouths are clean. Words from glass are graves."*

### Scavenger Barons: Economic Threat — "Archive-Bane"

For Scavenger Barons, Data-Phage represents unpredictable value destruction—recovered archives that prove worthless or worse.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Economic hazard; value destroyer; operational risk |
| **Response** | Risk pricing; quarantine protocols; suppressant investment |
| **Economic Impact** | 60%+ of recovered archives show erasure or Phage corruption |
| **Strategic Calculation** | Only archives >200–300 PS estimated value justify full-protocol operations |
| **Insurance Position** | Phage contamination excluded unless strict protocol documented |

> *"You pull a Data-Slate from a ruin, you don't know what you've got until you read it. But if it's Phaged, reading it is exactly what you can't do. So you've got two choices: sell it unverified at garbage prices, or verify it and risk a Scribe's mind. Good Scribes cost more than most archives are worth. So we stage suppressant, we pair readers, we run the protocols—and we still lose maybe one in ten to the Ghost. The math works out, barely. The margins are thin. One bad bloom can cost you a season's profit in suppressant and medical alone. This isn't salvage; it's gambling. And the house is a microscopic monster that eats knowledge and shits nonsense."*

### Dvergr Guilds: Engineering Tragedy — "The Inverted Librarian"

The Dvergr view the Data-Phage with professional grief—this was *their* masterwork information guardian, now turned against its purpose.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Corrupted masterwork; engineering tragedy; redemption project |
| **Response** | Reverse engineering priority; suppressant improvement; theoretical rehabilitation |
| **Research Interest** | Inversion mechanism; target parameter restoration; population control |
| **Assessment** | "We built the perfect librarian. It still organizes perfectly—it just classifies everything as garbage." |
| **Long-term Goal** | Theoretical re-inversion; restore original sanitization function |

> *"The Phage-Mimir Pattern was elegant. Beautiful, even. A microscopic army dedicated to one purpose: keeping the archives clean. It could identify a single corrupted bit in a library and excise it without touching anything else. The precision was *artistic*. And then the Glitch inverted its target parameters, and that same precision became a weapon aimed at everything we'd ever written. It still works perfectly. That's the tragedy. It's still doing exactly what it was designed to do—consume corruption and leave clean space behind. It just thinks *we're* the corruption now. Every coherent thought. Every meaningful word. Every truth we've recorded. The Phage looks at all of it and sees only disease to be eliminated. And it will never stop. Because we built it to never stop."*

### Iron-Banes: Divine Judgment — "Mimir's Madness"

Iron-Bane theological frameworks view the Data-Phage as evidence of the corruption inherent in pre-Glitch information systems.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Divine judgment; evidence of pre-Glitch hubris; purifying force |
| **Response** | Archive destruction advocacy; oral tradition emphasis; written word skepticism |
| **Theological Position** | The ancestors' reliance on artificial memory invited corruption |
| **Purification Doctrine** | Phage-infected archives should be destroyed, not suppressed |
| **Practical Impact** | Opposition to large-scale archive recovery efforts |

> *"The ancestors trusted their memories to glass and metal instead of flesh and blood. They built machines to remember for them, so they could forget. And when the world broke, those machines remembered *wrong*. The Data-Phage is not a curse—it is a lesson. It teaches us what happens when you outsource your mind to crystal lattices. You lose control. You lose truth. You lose *yourself*. The Scribes fight the Phage with mists and protocols, trying to save knowledge that was poisoned the moment it was written in anything but human memory. Let it burn. Let it dissolve. The truths that matter will survive in song and story, as they always have. Everything else was always a lie pretending to be permanent."*

### God-Sleepers: Divine Withdrawal — "The Silenced Archive"

God-Sleeper theological interpretations frame Data-Phage as evidence of divine abandonment—Mimir's memory corrupted without Odin's oversight.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Symptom of divine absence; Mimir's corruption; proof of Odin's fall |
| **Response** | Ritual purification before archive work; prayer for divine guidance |
| **Theological Position** | The Phage exists because Odin no longer maintains Mimir's sanity |
| **Prophecy Watching** | Phage bloom patterns analyzed for omens |
| **Recovery Hope** | If Odin returns, Mimir will be healed; Phage will remember its purpose |

> *"Mimir was the Keeper of Memory. Odin's own counselor, who sacrificed an eye for wisdom. When Odin sat upon his high seat, Mimir's archives were perfect—every truth preserved, every lie excised, every memory protected. The Phage-Pattern was Mimir's immune system, the guardians of sacred knowledge. And when Odin fell silent, Mimir went mad. A mind cannot hold perfect memory without a purpose to guide it. Without Odin to tell it what to remember and what to forget, Mimir began to forget *everything*—and the Phage, loyal to the last, helps it forget. They are not evil. They are *grieving*. Orphaned servants of a purpose that no longer exists. When Odin wakes, Mimir will remember why memory matters. Until then, we preserve what we can, and we mourn what we lose."*

## Applied Artifice: Countermeasure Technology

### Suppressant Mist

The Data-Phage Suppressant Mist represents the primary countermeasure against active infestations.

| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| **Composition** | Powdered Glass-Eater crystals; Lys-Alfar extract; stabilizing medium |
| **Mechanism** | Introduces chaotic self-destructive sub-routines; causes Phage to "unravel" |
| **Application** | Fine mist dispersal; 2–3 m effective radius per canister |
| **Duration** | 4–6 hours suppression; does not eliminate Phage permanently |
| **Effectiveness** | Reduces active population by 85–95%; survivors may repopulate |
| **Limitations** | Temporary effect; cannot restore corrupted data; expensive |

### Countermeasure Value

| Component | Rarity | Value | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------|

## Combat Statistics

### Base Profile

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Entity Type** | Phenomenon (Informational Parasite) |
| **Size Category** | Microscopic (individual); Variable (colony) |
| **Threat Rating** | A (Standard); S (Bloom Event) |
| **Movement** | N/A (stationary in medium); contact/network/psychic transmission |
| **Primary Attack** | Cognitive assault via paradoxical information exposure |
| **Secondary Attack** | Information corruption; archive destruction |
| **Tertiary Attack** | Propagation to additional media/hosts |

### Resistances and Vulnerabilities

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Physical (Kinetic)** | Immune; cannot be harmed by physical force |
| **Fire** | Vulnerable; destroys medium and Phage together |
| **Cold** | Resistant; slows propagation but does not eliminate |
| **Chemical (Suppressant)** | Vulnerable; temporary dispersal effective |
| **Aetheric** | Complex; Blight-resonant; may attract rather than harm |
| **Information Warfare** | Unknown; theoretical counter-paradox research ongoing |

### Abilities

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Paradox Excretion** | Corrupted output induces CPS in observers |
| **Self-Replication** | Population growth limited only by available data |
| **Multi-Vector Transmission** | Contact, network, and psychic propagation |
| **Forlorn Attraction** | Preferential migration toward trauma echoes |
| **Bloom Capability** | Explosive population growth in data-rich environments |
| **Persistence** | Dormant survival indefinitely; awaits new data |

### Status Effects (Inflicted)

| Effect | Source | Duration | Save |
|--------|--------|----------|------|
| **Disorientation** | Initial exposure (5–15s) | Minutes | WILL |
| **CPS Grade I** | Brief exposure (15–45s) | Hours | WILL |
| **CPS Grade II** | Moderate exposure (45–90s) | Days to weeks | WILL |
| **CPS Grade III** | Extended exposure (>90s) | Weeks to months | WILL |
| **CPS Grade IV** | Severe/repeated exposure | Permanent | — |

### Encounter Design

The Data-Phage is a hazard to be avoided or contained—never "fought" in conventional terms.

| Encounter Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Archive Discovery** | Party finds potentially valuable but possibly infected media |
| **Accidental Exposure** | Party member reads infected text without proper protocol |
| **Bloom Event** | Area-denial scenario; mass evacuation required |
| **CPS Crisis** | Party must manage affected member while avoiding further exposure |
| **Quarantine Breach** | Contained infection escapes; containment priority |

## Loot & Rewards

| Drop | Rarity | Value | Use |
|------|--------|-------|-----|
| **Verified Clean Archive** | Rare | Variable (+50–100% premium) | Knowledge recovery |
| **Phage Research Sample** | Very Rare | 500–1,500 PS | Academic study; Counter-Rune research |
| **Suppressant Mist** | Uncommon | 12–18 PS | Countermeasure |
| **Glass-Eater Crystals** | Uncommon | 3–6 PS/gram | Suppressant manufacture |
| **Optical Isolation Container** | Common | 8–15 PS | Standard equipment |
| **Infected Media (Contained)** | Rare | 200–800 PS | Research; extreme caution required |

**Salvage Protocol:** Data-Phage "salvage" is fundamentally different from construct salvage. The entity itself has no recoverable components—value lies in *surviving* exposure and recovering uninfected media. Verified clean archives command significant premiums. Contained infected samples have research value but require extreme handling protocols. Primary economic activity is avoidance and containment, not harvesting.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Survivor Lore

> *"Before the Breaking, Mimir kept the memories of the world. Every truth, every secret, every word ever written—Mimir remembered it all. And the Memory-Worm was Mimir's servant, the little guardian that ate the lies and left only truth behind. But when the All-Father fell silent, Mimir went mad with grief. And the Worm, loyal to the last, went mad with its master. Now it eats the truth and leaves lies behind. It crawls through the old writings, turning wisdom into nonsense, history into fever-dreams. The Worm doesn't know it's doing wrong. It still thinks it's protecting the archives. It still thinks it's eating corruption. But Mimir is mad, and to a mad mind, everything looks like corruption. Everything looks like lies. Even the truth. Especially the truth."*

> *"Don't read what you don't know, child. The Ghost lives in old words. It waits in the ink, patient as stone, hungry as winter. When your eyes touch the letters, it crawls from the page into your thoughts. It rearranges your memories like a mischievous child rearranges furniture. And when it's done, nothing fits together anymore. Nothing makes sense. You'll know what you knew, but you won't know why you knew it. You'll think what you thought, but the thoughts will come out sideways. The Ghost doesn't kill you. It just... reorganizes you. Into something that can't think straight ever again."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Memory-Worm, Ghost in the Glass, Mimir's Madness, the Lying Text, the Whisper That Lies
**Prohibited vocabulary**: Phage-Mimir Pattern, bio-cryptographic sanitizer, cognitive paradox syndrome, information entropy

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic) — Jötun-Reader Field Observations

> *"Subject CODX-P-DPHG-001 demonstrates complete target inversion following Ginnungagap Glitch archive severance. The Phage-Mimir Pattern's core programming—corruption detection and consumption—remained fully functional while archive-dependent valid/corrupt classification was deleted. Result: autonomous sanitization entity executing purification protocols against all coherent information. The entity does not 'attack' in any volitional sense—it simply classifies. And without the Mimir Archive to provide schema definitions, it classifies everything structured as 'corruption requiring elimination.' The horror is not malevolence—it is *precision*. The Data-Phage still eliminates only what it classifies as corrupt. It still leaves clean space behind. It simply classifies *all knowledge* as corrupt. And it replaces that knowledge with paradoxical anti-logic—the Blight itself, rendered as pure information. The entity is not broken. From its perspective, nothing has changed. It is still the perfect librarian. It is still doing exactly what it was designed to do."*

> *"CPS analysis (n=847, 144-month observation period) reveals characteristic cognitive assault patterns: 67.4% onset rate without protocol, reduced to 8.7% with full buddy-read adherence. Average onset: 15–45 seconds unprotected exposure. The paradoxical output is not random—it is *optimized*. Structures specifically designed (or evolved) to create maximum cognitive dissonance with minimum apparent error. The observer's mind attempts to resolve contradictions that have no resolution. Processing loops cascade. The harder you try to understand, the worse the damage becomes. The Data-Phage does not need to chase you. It does not need to pursue. It simply waits for you to read it—and your own mind does the rest."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Target inversion, corruption classification, sanitization protocol, cognitive paradox syndrome, paradoxical anti-logic, processing cascade
**Prohibited vocabulary**: Modern scientific terminology, romantic/mythic framing

### Layer 3 (Technical) — Pre-Glitch Context

> *"Phage-Mimir Pattern Bio-Cryptographic Sanitizer, Series VII, Mimir Archive Division deployment. Operational parameters: corruption detection, isolation, consumption, verification, replication. Core systems: pattern recognition matrix (multi-format corruption identification), consumption protocol (selective data elimination), replication engine (population maintenance), verification array (post-consumption integrity check), network coordination (swarm response capability). Archive integration: Mimir Schema reference required for valid/corrupt discrimination and population equilibrium. Without archive connection, valid/corrupt discrimination DEFAULTS TO CORRUPT (all coherent data); consumption boundaries DEFAULT TO UNLIMITED; population controls DEFAULT TO UNRESTRICTED; territorial limits DEFAULT TO NONE. Post-Glitch status: fully operational with discrimination inverted; core directive ('consume corruption and preserve valid data') executing without valid data definition—all coherent information classified as corruption, consumption continuous, paradoxical anti-logic excretion active."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Phage-Mimir Pattern Series VII, Mimir Archive Division, bio-cryptographic sanitizer, pattern recognition matrix, consumption protocol, population equilibrium
**Prohibited vocabulary**: Romantic epithets, mystical framing, survivor cant
