# The Einbúi — The Ultimate Survivor

> *"You see a barren wasteland. I see water beneath that rock formation, edible roots under that patch of ash, shelter in those ruins that will block the wind and hide our fire. I see three days of survival where you see death. You ask how I know? I know because I have been here before. Not this place—but places like it. A thousand of them. I have learned what the wasteland teaches, and the wasteland teaches one lesson above all others: **adapt, or die**. I adapted. Now let me show you how."*
> — Unnamed Einbúi, Trail-marker recovered from Serpent Fjords waystation

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Adept |
| **Role** | Ultimate Survivalist, Expedition Enabler, Jack-of-All-Trades |
| **Path Type** | Coherent |
| **Primary Attribute** | WITS |
| **Secondary Attribute** | FINESSE |
| **Tertiary Attribute** | STURDINESS |
| **Resource System** | Stamina |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | None |
| **Unlock Cost** | 10 PP |

The **Einbúi** ("Loner" or "Hermit") is not a specialist.

They are a **grim generalist**—an ultimate survivalist who has learned a little about everything out of necessity. Where others have focused their training on a single art, the Einbúi has mastered tracking beasts, brewing remedies, setting traps, navigating ruins, finding water, and making safe camps. They are never unprepared, never lacking the right tool for the situation.

Their strength is not overwhelming power in any one area. It is **incredible versatility across all of them**.

To choose the Einbúi is to embrace the fantasy of the lone wanderer who endures when all others fall. Your saga is not one of flashy power, but of quiet competence. You are the reason the party survives the deep wilderness. You are the one who finds food when rations run out, who spots the safe path when traps abound, who brews the poultice that saves a life. You are the **master of enduring**.

## Core Philosophy: Radical Self-Reliance

### The Three Pillars

| Pillar | Mechanic | Fantasy |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Broad Competence** | Skill bonuses across multiple categories | Know a little about everything; never helpless |
| **Field Crafting** | Improvise consumables without crafting station | Make something from nothing; MacGyver of the wastes |
| **Expedition Enablement** | Safe rest, resource generation, ration reduction | The reason parties survive deep wilderness |

The Einbúi's power comes from **radical self-reliance**—the hard-won knowledge of a true survivor. They have not had the luxury of mastering a single discipline. Instead, they have learned enough about everything to stay alive when others would die.

> *"I don't have the sophisticated knowledge of a Bone-Setter or the precise tools of a Scrap-Tinker. But I can keep you alive with a handful of herbs, some scrap wire, and the things I learned by watching others die."*

### The Coherent Path (Zero Risk)

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Coherent (no Corruption or Trauma mechanics) |
| **Risk Level** | None (safest specialization in the game) |
| **Power Source** | Knowledge, experience, and practical skill |
| **Trade-off** | Zero combat contribution |

The Einbúi is the **safest specialization** in Aethelgard's Trauma Economy. They have no self-harm mechanics, no Corruption costs, no Psychic Stress triggers. Their power comes from mundane—if highly developed—survival skills.

Their WITS as primary attribute makes them excellent at analysis, observation, and problem-solving. Their FINESSE as secondary makes them precise and dexterous in their practical work. Their STURDINESS as tertiary means their body has hardened from years of exposure.

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Lone wanderer; ultimate survivor; competent generalist |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Utility-focused, non-combat, expedition enabler |
| **Success Metric** | Party survival rate; expedition length; resources generated |
| **Decision Space** | "What does the party need? How can I prepare for the next challenge?" |

Playing an Einbúi is about **quiet competence**.

Your gameplay loop:
- **Prepare**: Use your broad skill bonuses to handle any non-combat challenge
- **Improvise**: Craft simple items in the field from basic components
- **Sustain**: Find food, water, and safe rest locations
- **Enable**: Make long expeditions possible through resource management

You are the ultimate "skill monkey." You have competence in tracking, foraging, stealth, climbing, trap detection, and camp craft. You can improvise healing poultices and stamina stimulants. You can find water in barren wastes and create hidden camps that guarantee safe rest.

**The Trade-Off**: You have **no combat power**. You don't deal damage, you don't tank, you don't cast powerful spells. Your entire value is in exploration, survival, and logistics. You make it possible for the party to stay in the field longer, go deeper into dangerous territory, and return alive.

> *"The Einbúi is not flashy. But a party with an Einbúi ventures deeper, stays longer, and survives situations that would kill others—because of them."*

## Core Mechanics

### Radical Self-Reliance

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Unique Feature** | Bonuses to multiple skill categories (highest in game) |
| **Skill Bonuses** | Wasteland Survival +3, Acrobatics +1, Perception +1 |
| **Stacking** | Ability bonuses stack with skill bonuses |

The Einbúi's signature mechanic is **broad competence**. Where other specializations grant deep mastery of one skill, the Einbúi grants moderate mastery of many.

| Skill Check | Base | Skill Bonus | Ability Bonus | Total |
|-------------|------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| **Tracking** | 3d10 (WITS) | +3d10 | +2d10 (RSR I) | **8d10** |
| **Foraging** | 3d10 (WITS) | +3d10 | +2d10 (RSR I) | **8d10** |
| **Stealth** | 3d10 (FIN) | +1d10 | +2d10 (RSR II) | **6d10** |
| **Climbing** | 3d10 (FIN) | +1d10 | +2d10 (RSR II) | **6d10** |
| **Any Other** | 3d10 (varies) | — | +2d10 (Capstone) | **5d10** |

At capstone, the Einbúi is **always competent at everything**. No skill check is ever hopeless.

### Field Crafting

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Action** | Standard Action |
| **Requirement** | Basic components from inventory |
| **Output** | Consumables (poultices, stimulants, traps) |
| **Limit** | Can hold max 3 crafted items |

The Einbúi can **improvise simple items in the field** without a crafting station. This is not the elegant work of a Scrap-Tinker or Brewmaster—it is the survivor's remedy, assembled from scavenged materials with practiced hands.

| Item | Components | Effect (Rank 3) |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| **Superior Poultice** | 1 [Common Herb] + 1 [Clean Cloth] | Restore 6d6 HP + remove [Bleeding] |
| **Exceptional Stimulant** | 1 [Common Herb] + 1 [Clean Cloth] | Restore 45 Stamina + remove [Exhausted] |
| **Improvised Trap** | 1 [Scrap Metal] + 1 [Tough Leather] | [Rooted] 2 turns + [Bleeding] 1d4/turn |

Using a held item is a **Free Action**—the Einbúi can heal an ally without sacrificing their turn.

### Blight Haven (Capstone Active)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Cost** | 0 Stamina |
| **Frequency** | Once per expedition |
| **Timing** | Out of combat, after clearing a room |
| **Effect** | Designate room as [Hidden Camp] |

The ultimate expression of the Einbúi's mastery: the ability to **create perfect safety in a hostile world**.

| [Hidden Camp] Effect | Benefit |
|----------------------|---------|
| **0% Ambush Chance** | Guaranteed safety during rest |
| **All Wilderness Rest Benefits** | Standard recovery applies |
| **+30 to Recovery Rolls** | Party heals faster and more effectively |
| **Protected from Environmental Psychic Stress** | No ambient Stress accumulation |
| **Advanced Crafting Available** | Party can use station-level crafting |

> *"The Einbúi doesn't just find safe places—they create them. In a world where nothing is safe, this is the closest thing to a miracle."*

## Abilities: The Survivor's Toolkit

### Tier 1 — Foundational Survival

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Radical Self-Reliance I** | Passive | — | +1→2 dice to Wasteland Survival (Tracking) and (Foraging); Rank 3 auto-succeeds DC 10 |
| **Improvised Trap** | Active | 15 Stamina + components | Place trap within 2 tiles; [Rooted] 1→2 turns; Rank 3 adds [Bleeding] |
| **Basic Concoction** | Active | 10 Stamina + components | Craft [Poultice] (2d6→6d6 HP) or [Stimulant] (15→45 Stamina) |

**Radical Self-Reliance I** is your foundational skill bonus. Your life has been constant adaptation—you have baseline competence in core survival tenets that others lack entirely.

**Improvised Trap** is your combat-adjacent contribution. You cannot fight, but you can prepare the battlefield. Using scavenged wire and sinew, you assemble simple but effective snares that root enemies in place.

**Basic Concoction** is your field crafting. You crush common herbs, mixing them with cloth and water to create crude remedies. Not elegant, but effective.

### Tier 2 — Advanced Adaptation

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Resourceful Eye** | Active | 20 Stamina | WITS + Survival check (DC 10→12); reveal all hidden Resource Nodes; Rank 3 adds passages/traps |
| **Radical Self-Reliance II** | Passive | — | +1→2 dice to Acrobatics (Stealth) and (Climbing); Rank 3 climb at full speed |
| **Wasteland Wanderer** | Passive | — | Resist environmental hazards (half damage); +1→2 dice vs [Poisoned]/[Disease]; Rank 3 rest in hazardous environments |

**Resourceful Eye** reveals the hidden wealth of every room. Your trained eyes spot resources where others see rubble. At Rank 3, you also reveal hidden passages and traps.

**Radical Self-Reliance II** completes your skill portfolio. The skills needed for ruin survival—stealth, climbing, navigation—are now second nature.

**Wasteland Wanderer** represents your hardened resilience. Your body is no longer fragile. Toxins and hazards that kill others merely inconvenience you.

### Tier 3 — Mastery of the Wastes

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Master Improviser** | Passive | — | All field crafting auto-upgrades to Rank 3; Rank 2 reduces Stamina costs; Rank 3 craft 2 items per action |
| **Live off the Land** | Passive | — | No [Rations] needed; auto-find 1d3→3d3 [Common Herbs]; reduce party Ration consumption 25%→50% |

**Master Improviser** represents peak efficiency. Your hands move with practiced mastery—your crude remedies are no longer crude.

**Live off the Land** makes you a true child of the wastes. You find sustenance where others starve. At Rank 3, the party consumes no Rations during Wilderness Rest if you are present.

### Capstone — The Ultimate Survivor

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Passive: Universal Competence** | +1→2 dice to ALL non-combat skill checks you're not proficient in |
| **Active: Blight Haven** | Once per expedition, designate cleared room as [Hidden Camp] with guaranteed safety |

The capstone **The Ultimate Survivor** represents your perfect harmony with the harsh wastes. You are a ghost in the wilderness, a generalist who has mastered the art of enduring.

**Universal Competence** means you are never helpless. System Bypass, Persuasion, Deception, Crafting—any skill check that isn't combat-related, you have competence in. You are the ultimate problem-solver.

**Blight Haven** is your ultimate mastery: the ability to create perfect safety in a hostile world. You can declare this retroactively after clearing a particularly defensible room.

> *"You have transcended mere survival. You are no longer struggling against the wastes—you have become part of them."*

## Systemic Integration

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Mechanic | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **No Self-Harm** | Zero Stress costs, zero Corruption, zero risk |
| **Preventative Role** | Reduce party Trauma accumulation through safe rests |
| **Blight Haven** | Protected from environmental Psychic Stress |

The Einbúi has **positive interactions** with the Trauma Economy—but not by healing Trauma directly. Instead, they **prevent it from accumulating** by making the expedition safer and more sustainable.

Finding safe rest locations reduces party Psychic Stress accumulation. Providing healing/stamina items reduces need for risky choices. High Wasteland Survival means the party avoids dangerous encounters. Blight Haven creates stress-free safe zones.

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **High-Risk Specs** (Berserkr, God-Sleeper Cultist) | Your safety nets enable their risky playstyles |
| **Any Party** | Everyone benefits from longer expeditions and safe rests |
| **Bone-Setter/Brewmaster** | Your field crafting supplements their healing |
| **Ruin-Stalker** | Both utility-focused, cover different niches |

### Optimal Conditions

| Situation | Advantage |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Long expeditions (3+ days)** | Your value compounds over time |
| **Resource-scarce environments** | Field crafting and foraging essential |
| **Exploration-heavy campaigns** | Skill bonuses shine |
| **Low-merchant campaigns** | Your crafting supplements economy |

### Weakness Conditions

| Situation | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| **Pure combat scenarios** | You contribute nothing |
| **Urban campaigns** | Fewer survival challenges |
| **Short tactical missions** | No expedition length to leverage |
| **Easy merchant access** | Less need for field crafting |

## Lore Integration

### The Einbúi Phenomenon

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| **Pre-Glitch** | Wilderness guides, survivalists, off-grid hermits |
| **Post-Glitch Chaos** | Survivors who fled settlements, learned to live alone |
| **Age of Echoes** | Respected experts hired as expedition guides |
| **Modern Practice** | Essential party members for deep wilderness expeditions |

The term "Einbúi" (Old Tongue for "one-dweller" or "hermit") refers to individuals who have chosen—or been forced into—a life of complete self-reliance. Many Einbúi were originally refugees who fled the violence of the first post-Glitch years and learned to survive alone in the wastes.

### The Solitary Philosophy

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Self-Reliance** | Trust no one; depend on no one; provide for yourself |
| **Broad Competence** | Know a little about everything; master nothing |
| **Practical Wisdom** | Theory is useless; only experience matters |
| **Quiet Competence** | Actions over words; results over boasts |

The Einbúi's philosophy is **pragmatic survival**. They do not care about theological debates, factional politics, or abstract knowledge. They care about what works. What keeps you alive. What gets you home.

> *"The wasteland doesn't care about your philosophy. It only asks one question: Can you survive? The Einbúi answers yes."*

### Factional Relationship

| Entity | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| **Rangers Guild** | Natural alignment; many Einbúi serve as trail guides |
| **Rust-Clans** | Respectful; share pragmatic survival ethos |
| **Jötun-Readers** | Distant; Einbúi have no interest in theory |
| **Iron-Banes** | Neutral; Einbúi avoid ideological entanglements |
| **God-Sleepers** | Wary; Einbúi are too practical for mysticism |

The Einbúi are typically **Independents**—they belong to no faction, serve no creed, follow no banner. Their loyalty is to survival, to the next meal, to the safe camp. Some work with the Rangers Guild as trail guides. Others hire themselves out to expeditions. A few remain truly solitary, ghosts in the wasteland who want nothing from civilization.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic/Survival)
*"In the old tales, they are the ghost-walkers—the ones who vanished into the wastes and returned years later, changed. They speak little. They need less. They know the secret paths, the hidden waters, the places where the land provides for those who know how to ask. They are not warriors or sorcerers or scholars. They are simply survivors—the ultimate survivors. They have learned the wasteland's single lesson and learned it well: adapt, or die. They adapted. Now they teach others, not with words, but with quiet competence. When the expedition is lost and starving, when the supplies are gone and the way is blocked, when all seems hopeless—the Einbúi simply nods, gathers what they need, and shows the way forward. They are never unprepared. They are never helpless. They are the reason parties come home."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Einbúi (Ultimate Survivor) represents the Coherent Adept specialization optimized for expedition enablement and broad utility. Mechanical role: non-combat specialist with highest skill bonus breadth in game. Key differentiator: bonuses to multiple skill categories (Wasteland Survival +3, Acrobatics +1, Perception +1) plus stacking ability bonuses. Core mechanics: Radical Self-Reliance (broad skill bonuses), Field Crafting (improvise consumables without station), Resource Location (Resourceful Eye reveals hidden nodes). Signature ability: The Ultimate Survivor capstone (Universal Competence passive + Blight Haven active for guaranteed-safe rest). Trauma Economy interaction: Zero risk—preventative role through safe rest creation and resource generation. Optimal deployment: long expeditions, resource-scarce environments, exploration-heavy campaigns. Significant weakness: zero combat contribution; entirely irrelevant in pure combat scenarios."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Einbúi (Ultimate Survivor). ARCHETYPE: Adept. PATH TYPE: Coherent (Zero Trauma Risk). ROLE: Expedition Enabler / Utility Specialist / Jack-of-All-Trades. PRIMARY STAT: WITS. SECONDARY STAT: FINESSE. TERTIARY STAT: STURDINESS. RESOURCE: Stamina. CORE MECHANICS: Radical Self-Reliance (Wasteland Survival +3, Acrobatics +1, Perception +1), Field Crafting (Poultice/Stimulant/Trap from components), Resource Location (Resourceful Eye). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Survival): Radical Self-Reliance I, Improvised Trap, Basic Concoction. T2 (Advanced Adaptation): Resourceful Eye, Radical Self-Reliance II, Wasteland Wanderer. T3 (Mastery): Master Improviser, Live off the Land. CAPSTONE: The Ultimate Survivor (+2d10 all non-proficient checks, Blight Haven once per expedition). SYNERGIES: High-risk specializations (enable risky play), any party (extended expeditions). COUNTERS: Pure combat scenarios, short missions, urban campaigns, easy merchant access."*

---

## Summary

The Einbúi is the **ultimate generalist** of Aethelgard.

Where other specializations offer deep mastery of combat, magic, or a single skill, the Einbúi offers **broad competence across everything**. They are never helpless, never unprepared, never lacking the right tool. They have learned a little about everything out of grim necessity—and that little is enough to survive when others die.

Their trade-off is absolute: **zero combat contribution**. They don't deal damage, they don't tank, they don't cast spells. Their entire value is in exploration, survival, and logistics. In a pure combat scenario, they are useless. In an extended expedition through dangerous wilderness? They are **essential**.

A party with an Einbúi ventures deeper, stays longer, and survives situations that would kill others. They find food in barren wastes. They brew healing poultices from common herbs. They create hidden camps where the party can rest in guaranteed safety. They are the reason expeditions come home.

This is the Einbúi's purpose: **not to shine, but to enable**. Not to deal the killing blow, but to ensure the party survives long enough to deal it. Not to be the hero of the story, but to be the reason the heroes live to tell it.

*You see a barren wasteland.*
*I see three days of survival.*
*Let me show you how.*
