## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Cognitive Realignment is the Bone-Setter's **premier sanity-restoration ability**—the signature tool for managing the Trauma Economy. This establishes the Bone-Setter as essential for parties operating in high-Stress environments.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Remove [Feared] or [Disoriented] status from ally
- **Primary:** Remove large amount of Psychic Stress from ally
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The psychological first aid that "reboots" a panicking mind

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Very high (dual cleanse + Stress healing)
- **Consumable Gating:** Requires [Stabilizing Draught] (crafted, finite)
- **Critical Resource:** Stabilizing Draughts are valuable; usage is meaningful

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The ally's eyes are wild, unfocused, pupils dilated with terror. Their breathing is ragged, their mind fracturing under the weight of what they've witnessed. The Bone-Setter acts with practiced calm—firm hands guide the victim to sit, pressure applied to specific points, a draught of calming herbs placed to their lips. Breathing exercises, grounding techniques, the steady rhythm of the Bone-Setter's voice cutting through the panic.

"Look at me. You are here. You are alive. Breathe."

The mind stabilizes, coherence returning like tide filling a shell.

### Thematic Resonance

In Aethelgard, psychological damage is as real as physical wounds. The Bone-Setter's training extends beyond the body to the mind—they are the anchor that keeps allies coherent when the world tries to break them.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Activation

- **Action Type:** Standard Action
- **Consumable Cost:** 1 [Stabilizing Draught] from inventory
- **Range:** Touch (adjacent ally)
- **Target:** Single ally

### Effect

**Dual Function:**

1. **Status Cleanse:** Immediately removes **[Feared]** OR **[Disoriented]** from target (Bone-Setter chooses if both present)
2. **Stress Healing:** Target's Psychic Stress is reduced by a **large amount** (25-30 Stress, exact value TBD by system)

### [Stabilizing Draught] Crafting

- Crafted via Field Medicine at Campfire or Lab
- Requires rare calming herbs + alchemical reagents
- Enhanced by Field Medic I bonus die
- More difficult to craft than standard healing supplies

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Targeting:** Bone-Setter selects adjacent ally
2. **Consumable Check:** Verify [Stabilizing Draught] in inventory
3. **Consumable Consumption:** Remove draught from inventory
4. **Status Selection:** If [Feared] and [Disoriented] both present, choose one
5. **Status Cleanse:** Remove selected status
6. **Stress Reduction:** Reduce target's Psychic Stress by 25-30
7. **Threshold Check:** Update target's Stress threshold status if applicable

---

## V. Tactical Applications

1. **Trauma Economy Management:** Primary tool for reducing party Psychic Stress
2. **Mental Status Counter:** Essential against fear-inducing enemies (Forlorn, etc.)
3. **High-Risk Support:** Enables Jötun-Reader and other Stress-generating builds
4. **Combat Recovery:** Restore effectiveness to mentally debilitated allies
5. **Exploration Safety:** Keep party coherent in Blight-saturated areas

---

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Jötun-Reader:** High self-inflicted Stress makes them primary Cognitive Realignment target
- **Berserkr:** Low WILL means frequent mental debuffs; needs regular treatment
- **Skald:** Skald prevents Stress (proactive), Bone-Setter heals Stress (reactive)—complete coverage
- **Skjaldmær (Guardian's Taunt):** Helps manage Skjaldmær's self-inflicted Stress
- **High-Stress encounters:** Maximum value in Blight-heavy or Forlorn-heavy areas

### Negative Synergies

- **No Stabilizing Draughts:** Completely ineffective without consumables
- **Low-Stress encounters:** Overkill for encounters without mental effects
- **Skald already present:** Some overlap in Stress prevention/healing
