## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Communion of the Lost is the Seiðkona's **capstone ability**—the moment they fully open the veil and allow the collective voice of the dead to flood through them. This is the ultimate expression of their communion: devastating support and control at catastrophic personal cost.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Mass healing and buff to all allies
- **Secondary:** Mass debuff to all enemies
- **Tertiary:** Reveal all hidden information in area
- **Catastrophic Cost:** Maximum Psychic Stress (mind-shattering communion)
- **Fantasy Delivery:** Becoming one with the choir of the dead

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Extreme (triple-effect ultimate)
- **Devastating Self-Cost:** Maximum Psychic Stress is severe
- **Once Per Long Rest:** Cannot be used repeatedly
- **Combat Tide Turner:** Designed to reverse desperate situations

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Seiðkona stops fighting. They stop thinking. They simply **open**.

The veil between worlds does not part—it *dissolves*. For a single, eternal moment, the Seiðkona is no longer one person. They are a **chorus**—a thousand voices speaking in unison, a thousand memories flooding through a single mind. The dead speak through them, and their voice shakes the battlefield.

**To allies:** The spirits bring gifts—healing warmth, protective blessings, whispered warnings that guide strikes and deflect blows. The living feel the dead standing beside them, shoulder to shoulder, united against the common enemy.

**To enemies:** The spirits bring judgment—the weight of a thousand grievances, the cold of a thousand graves, the terror of being seen by eyes that remember everything.

And then it ends. The Seiðkona collapses, blood streaming from every orifice, their mind shattered by the communion. But the battle has turned.

### Thematic Resonance

This is the Seiðkona's ultimate sacrifice: surrendering their sanity to become a bridge between worlds, channeling the full power of the dead through their broken body.
