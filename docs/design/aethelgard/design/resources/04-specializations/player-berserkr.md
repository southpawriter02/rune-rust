# The Berserkr — The Roaring Fire

> *"You think rage is a weakness? You think it clouds the mind? You understand nothing. The world screams. The Blight howls. The Great Silence tears at the edges of reality. And I? I scream back. I open my soul to the chaos and let it fill me, let it burn through every nerve, let it push my body past every limit. I am not consumed by the fire. I AM the fire. And everything I touch will burn."*
> — Úlfr Blood-Drinker, last words before the Siege of Járngrind

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Warrior |
| **Role** | Melee Damage Engine, Shock Trooper, Crowd Clearer |
| **Path Type** | Heretical |
| **Primary Attribute** | MIGHT |
| **Secondary Attribute** | STURDINESS |
| **Resource System** | Stamina + Fury (0-100) |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | High |
| **Unlock Cost** | 10 PP |

The **Berserkr** is not a disciplined soldier.

They are a **roaring fire of destruction**.

They have learned to open their minds to the violent, screaming psychic static of the Great Silence, using that chaotic feedback to fuel a battle-lust that pushes their bodies far beyond their normal limits. Where other Warriors fight with technique or faith, the Berserkr fights with the raw, untamed fury of a world that is tearing itself apart.

Their philosophy is heretical: **embrace the trauma**. The Blight screams? Let it scream through you. The Great Silence howls? Let it fuel your rage. Pain? Pain is just more fuel for the fire.

To choose the Berserkr is to embrace the fantasy of the **unstoppable barbarian and the high-risk, high-reward damage engine**. Your saga is written in the blood of your enemies and the scars on your own body. You are a terrifying whirlwind of pure, untamed destruction—a warrior who abandons tactical finesse and personal safety for the promise of overwhelming, glorious violence.

## Core Philosophy: The Art of Rage

### The Heretical Bargain

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Embrace the Trauma** | Open your mind to the Great Silence; let it fuel you |
| **Pain is Fuel** | Every wound is an invitation to greater violence |
| **Burn Bright** | Trade safety for output; momentum is your primary stat |
| **Die Standing** | The closer to death, the more dangerous you become |

The Berserkr's power is a direct interface with the Trauma Economy. They do not resist the psychic assault of the Blight—they **channel it**. The screaming chaos that breaks other minds becomes the fuel that drives them to superhuman feats of violence.

> *"The Berserkr opens their soul to the chaos and lets it fill them. They are not consumed by the fire. They ARE the fire."*

### The Heretical Path

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Heretical (direct Trauma Economy interface) |
| **Risk Level** | High (vulnerable to psychic attacks and mental debuffs) |
| **Power Source** | Channeled world-trauma; the Great Silence's feedback |
| **Trade-off** | -2 dice to WILL Resolve Checks while holding Fury |

The Berserkr is a **heretical Warrior**. Their power comes at a cost: while they hold any Fury, they suffer -2 dice to all WILL-based Resolve Checks. This makes them exceptionally vulnerable to:
- Psychic attacks
- Fear effects
- Mental status debuffs ([Feared], [Disoriented], [Charmed])

This is the bargain. This is the price of the fire.

> *"Their vulnerability to Psychic Stress and mental debuffs is their greatest weakness. The fire that burns brightest also burns fastest."*

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Unstoppable barbarian; terrifying whirlwind of destruction |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Visceral, aggressive, momentum-based damage dealer |
| **Success Metric** | Enemies dead; Fury spent; you survived (maybe) |
| **Decision Space** | "Do I spend Fury now or build higher? Can I survive another hit to build more?" |

Playing a Berserkr is about **managing the razor's edge** between overwhelming power and catastrophic collapse.

Your gameplay loop:
- **Build**: Deal damage → gain Fury. Take damage → gain MORE Fury.
- **Ramp**: The longer the fight, the more dangerous you become.
- **Spend**: Unleash devastating Fury-powered abilities at peak rage.
- **Survive**: Stay alive long enough to repeat—or go out in a blaze of glory.

You are the premier **sustained melee damage dealer** in the game, especially against groups of enemies. Your entire kit is a feedback loop: the more brutal the fight, the more powerful you become.

> *"Playing a Berserkr is a satisfying loop of building Fury by both dealing and taking damage, then spending that Fury on spectacular, devastating abilities."*

## Core Mechanics

### The Fury System

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Range** | 0-100 |
| **Decay** | None during combat |
| **Reset** | Completely lost on Sanctuary Rest |

Fury is the Berserkr's unique resource—a second bar alongside Stamina that builds from violence and fuels devastation.

| Source | Fury Gained |
|--------|-------------|
| **Dealing damage** | +5-15 per hit (ability-dependent) |
| **Taking damage** | +1 per HP lost (base) |
| **Blood-Fueled** | Doubles damage-to-Fury conversion |
| **Death or Glory** | +50-100% all generation while Bloodied |
| **Unleashed Roar** | +10 when taunted enemy attacks you |

| Spending | Cost |
|----------|------|
| **Unleashed Roar** | 20 Fury |
| **Whirlwind of Destruction** | 30 Fury |
| **Hemorrhaging Strike** | 40 Fury |

> *"Fury is not simple anger—it is the direct, heretical channeling of the world's psychic trauma."*

### The WILL Penalty

| Condition | Penalty |
|-----------|---------|
| **While holding ANY Fury** | -2 dice to all WILL-based Resolve Checks |

This is the mechanical expression of the heretical bargain. The fire that empowers you also makes you vulnerable. Every point of Fury you hold is a point of exposure to the very forces you're channeling.

**Tactical Implications:**
- Vulnerable to Fear effects while raging
- Psychic Stress accumulates faster
- Mental status effects harder to resist
- **Requires party support** (Bone-Setter, Skald, Skjaldmær)

### The Bloodied Threshold

| State | Definition | Effect |
|-------|------------|--------|
| **Bloodied** | Below 50% HP | Death or Glory activates: +50-100% Fury generation |
| **Critical** | Below 25% HP | Death or Glory Rank 3: +2 MIGHT |

The Berserkr fights with the greatest ferocity when on the brink of death. The lower your HP, the faster you build Fury, the more damage you deal. This creates dramatic "last stand" moments where a nearly-dead Berserkr becomes the most lethal thing on the battlefield.

## Abilities: The Art of Carnage

### Tier 1 — Foundational Fury

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Primal Vigor** | Passive | — | +2→4 Stamina regen per 25 Fury (breakpoints: 25/50/75/100) |
| **Wild Swing** | Active | 40 Stamina | 2d8+MIGHT Physical to all Front Row enemies; +5 Fury per enemy hit |
| **Reckless Assault** | Active | 35 Stamina | 3d10+MIGHT Physical single-target; +15 Fury; applies [Vulnerable] to self |

**Primal Vigor** is your sustain passive. As Fury builds, your body surges with adrenaline, accelerating Stamina recovery. At 100 Fury with Rank 3, you're regenerating +16 Stamina per turn—nearly doubling your base regeneration.

**Wild Swing** is your primary AoE Fury builder. A wide, reckless swing that cares nothing for precision—only widespread destruction. Against 4 enemies, that's +20 Fury in a single action.

> *"The Berserkr unleashes a wide, reckless swing, caring little for precision and focusing only on widespread destruction."*

**Reckless Assault** is your high-risk, high-reward single-target attack. You lower your guard completely, delivering a devastating blow. The [Vulnerable] debuff (+25% damage taken) is the price—but you generate +15 Fury instantly.

### Tier 2 — Advanced Carnage

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Unleashed Roar** | Active | 30 Stamina + 20 Fury | Taunt single enemy for 2 rounds; +10 Fury when taunted enemy attacks you |
| **Whirlwind of Destruction** | Active | 50 Stamina + 30 Fury | 3d8+MIGHT Physical to ALL enemies (both rows) |
| **Blood-Fueled** | Passive | — | Doubles→Triples Fury gained from taking damage |

**Unleashed Roar** is your hybrid offensive/defensive tool. A terrifying, guttural war cry that forces an enemy to focus on you. When they attack, you gain +10 Fury—converting their aggression into fuel.

> *"The Berserkr lets out a terrifying, guttural war cry, challenging a single foe to face their wrath."*

**Whirlwind of Destruction** is your ultimate AoE clear. A spinning vortex of pure destruction that reaches across the entire battlefield—Front AND Back rows. Expensive but battlefield-wide devastation.

**Blood-Fueled** is the cornerstone of Berserkr identity. It fundamentally alters your strategy by **doubling** (and at Rank 3, tripling) the Fury you gain from taking damage. Pain becomes power. A 30 HP hit with Blood-Fueled Rank 3 generates 90 Fury—nearly a full bar.

> *"Pain is a catalyst. Every wound is an invitation to greater violence. The Berserkr has learned to transform suffering into power."*

### Tier 3 — Mastery of Rage

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Hemorrhaging Strike** | Active | 45 Stamina + 40 Fury | 4d10+MIGHT Physical; applies [Bleeding] 3d6/turn for 3 rounds |
| **Death or Glory** | Passive | — | While [Bloodied]: +50→100% all Fury generation |

**Hemorrhaging Strike** is your devastating single-target finisher. You focus your rage into a single, savage blow that opens a grievous injury. The [Bleeding] effect deals an additional ~31 damage over 3 rounds—total output of ~63 damage from one ability.

**Death or Glory** is the passive that defines the Berserkr's "last stand" fantasy. The closer to death, the more dangerous you become. At Rank 3 while Bloodied, ALL Fury generation is doubled. Taking damage, dealing damage, everything generates twice as much Fury.

> *"The Berserkr fights with the greatest ferocity when on the brink of death. Desperation fuels transcendent rage."*

### Capstone — Unstoppable Fury

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Type** | Passive |
| **Effect (Rank 1)** | Immunity to [Feared] and [Stunned]; once per combat, survive lethal damage at 1 HP and instantly gain 100 Fury |
| **Effect (Rank 2)** | Twice per combat lethal survival |
| **Effect (Rank 3)** | Also immune to [Disoriented] and [Charmed] |

The capstone **Unstoppable Fury** represents the moment when rage transcends mere emotion and becomes a force of nature. The Berserkr's fury allows them to defy death itself.

> *"The first time the Berserkr would be reduced to 0 HP in combat, their Health is instead set to 1, and they instantly gain 100 Fury. They were supposed to die. Instead, they became the most dangerous thing on the battlefield."*

This is the ultimate expression of the Berserkr philosophy: the closer to death, the more powerful. The moment that should end you instead fills you with maximum Fury—ready for one final, devastating rampage.

## Systemic Integration

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Mechanic | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **WILL Penalty** | -2 dice to WILL Resolve while holding Fury |
| **Psychic Vulnerability** | Increased Stress accumulation |
| **Fear Susceptibility** | Harder to resist [Feared] effects |
| **Capstone Mitigation** | Unstoppable Fury grants immunity to [Feared]/[Stunned] |

The Berserkr is the ultimate risk/reward proposition in the Trauma Economy. They gain incredible power by opening themselves to the Great Silence—but that openness makes them vulnerable to its effects.

**Party support is essential.** The Berserkr needs:
- **Skjaldmær**: To absorb damage and protect during vulnerable moments
- **Skald**: To provide Fear immunity and Stress prevention
- **Bone-Setter**: To heal the damage that fuels your Fury and manage Stress

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Skjaldmær** | Tank holds front line while Berserkr builds Fury; Taunt redirect protects during [Vulnerable] |
| **Bone-Setter** | Heals damage, manages Stress, enables sustained aggression |
| **Skald** | Saga of Courage provides Fear immunity—critical for WILL-penalized Berserkr |
| **Atgeir-Wielder** | Hook and Drag serves targets; Line Breaker creates AoE opportunities |
| **Hólmgangr** | Duelist handles single threats while Berserkr clears crowds |

> *"The Berserkr walks the razor between godlike harm and sudden collapse. Pair with a wall or die loud and early."*

### Optimal Conditions

| Situation | Advantage |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Long, brutal encounters** | Fury accumulates over time |
| **Multiple enemies** | AoE abilities scale with target count |
| **Attrition fights** | Taking damage = more Fury |
| **Strong healer support** | Survives reckless playstyle |

### Weakness Conditions

| Situation | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| **Short burst fights** | No time to build Fury |
| **Psychic-heavy enemies** | -2 WILL penalty is devastating |
| **Solo play** | No support to cover vulnerabilities |
| **Heavy CC enemies** | Vulnerable to fear/stun until capstone |

---

## Lore Integration

### Historical Development

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| **Pre-Glitch** | Berserker traditions existed but were rare |
| **Post-Glitch Crisis** | Survivors discovered trauma could be channeled |
| **Age of Echoes** | Formalized heretical doctrine; paired with shields and minders |
| **Modern Practice** | Shock-trooper role; paired with Skjaldmær and Bone-Setter |

The Berserkr tradition evolved from desperate necessity. In the immediate aftermath of the Glitch, some survivors discovered they could channel the psychic assault that broke others into fuel for combat. They burned brighter—and burned out faster—but in those early days, that trade was worth it.

### The Heretical Doctrine

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Burn Bright** | Trade safety for output; momentum is everything |
| **Pair with a Wall** | Skjaldmær partnership is doctrine, not suggestion |
| **Monitor Psyche** | Fury without boundary becomes Static Sickness |
| **Exit on Signal** | Pride is a system fault, not a virtue |

The Layer 2 practitioners understand the Berserkr as a "heretical shock-trooper who channels the world's hurt into force at contact." Their treatises emphasize the critical importance of partnership with a Skjaldmær (the "wall") and oversight from a Bone-Setter or Skald (the "minders").

> *"Do not stand alone. Pair with a wall or die loud and early. Monitor psyche: fury without boundary becomes Static Sickness."*

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Jötun-Readers** | Document Berserkr patterns as useful data; concerned about long-term psychic damage |
| **Iron-Banes** | View heretical path with suspicion but respect combat effectiveness |
| **Rust-Clans** | Natural affinity; many Rust-Clan warriors follow Berserkr traditions |
| **Rangers Guild** | Respect the power but prefer controlled allies on long expeditions |
| **Gate-Holds** | Value for siege-breaking but require careful management |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the songs, they are the roaring fires. When the Great Silence screams, they scream back. When the Blight howls, they howl louder. They have learned the darkest secret of the broken world: the trauma that shatters minds can fuel bodies beyond all mortal limits. They open their souls to the chaos, let it fill them, let it burn through every nerve—and they become unstoppable engines of destruction. They are not disciplined soldiers. They are forces of nature, terrible and glorious, burning across battlefields in whirlwinds of blood and steel. They fight until they cannot stand, and then they fight from their knees, and then they fight from the ground, and only death—only TRUE death—can stop them. Their sagas are short. Their sagas are glorious. Their sagas end in fire."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Berserkr (The Roaring Fire) represents the Heretical Warrior specialization optimized for sustained melee damage and AoE destruction. Mechanical role: damage engine with unique Fury resource system. Key differentiator: builds Fury from BOTH dealing and taking damage, creating momentum-based power curve. Core mechanics: Fury (0-100 resource), Blood-Fueled (damage-to-Fury multiplication), Death or Glory (Bloodied state amplification), WILL penalty (-2 dice while holding Fury). Signature ability: Unstoppable Fury capstone (Fear/Stun immunity, lethal-to-1HP survival, instant 100 Fury). Trauma Economy interaction: High risk—WILL penalty creates vulnerability to psychic attacks and mental debuffs. Optimal deployment: prolonged multi-target encounters with healer support. Requires Skjaldmær/Skald/Bone-Setter partnership to mitigate vulnerabilities."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Berserkr (The Roaring Fire). ARCHETYPE: Warrior. PATH TYPE: Heretical (High Trauma Risk). ROLE: Melee Damage Engine / Shock Trooper / AoE Clearer. PRIMARY STAT: MIGHT. SECONDARY STAT: STURDINESS. RESOURCE: Stamina + Fury (0-100). CORE MECHANICS: Fury Generation (damage dealt +5-15, damage taken +1 base, Blood-Fueled ×2-3, Death or Glory +50-100%), Fury Spending (20-40 cost abilities), WILL Penalty (-2 dice to WILL Resolve while Fury > 0). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Fury): Primal Vigor, Wild Swing, Reckless Assault. T2 (Advanced Carnage): Unleashed Roar, Whirlwind of Destruction, Blood-Fueled. T3 (Mastery): Hemorrhaging Strike, Death or Glory. CAPSTONE: Unstoppable Fury (immune Fear/Stun/Disoriented/Charmed, survive lethal at 1 HP + 100 Fury, once-twice per combat). SYNERGIES: Skjaldmær (tank partnership), Bone-Setter (healing/Stress), Skald (Fear immunity). COUNTERS: Psychic enemies, Fear/CC-heavy encounters, short fights, solo play."*

## Summary

The Berserkr is the **roaring fire** of Aethelgard.

Where other Warriors fight with discipline or faith, the Berserkr fights with the raw, channeled fury of a breaking world. Their unique Fury resource builds from both dealing AND taking damage, creating a momentum-based power curve where the longer and more brutal the fight, the more devastating they become.

Their heretical path comes with costs. The -2 WILL penalty while holding Fury makes them vulnerable to the very psychic forces they channel. Fear effects, mental debuffs, and Psychic Stress accumulation are all amplified. Without party support—a Skjaldmær to hold the line, a Skald to provide Fear immunity, a Bone-Setter to manage the damage—the Berserkr burns out fast.

But with that support? They are the premier sustained melee damage dealer in the game. Wild Swing and Whirlwind of Destruction devastate crowds. Hemorrhaging Strike annihilates priority targets. Blood-Fueled transforms every wound into power. Death or Glory makes them most dangerous when they should be most vulnerable.

Their capstone, Unstoppable Fury, is the ultimate expression of the Berserkr philosophy: immunity to Fear and Stun, and the ability to survive lethal damage once per combat—setting HP to 1 and instantly filling the Fury bar to maximum. The moment that should kill them instead makes them the most dangerous thing on the battlefield.

*The world screams.*
*The Blight howls.*
*And I scream back.*
*I am the fire.*
*And everything I touch will burn.*
