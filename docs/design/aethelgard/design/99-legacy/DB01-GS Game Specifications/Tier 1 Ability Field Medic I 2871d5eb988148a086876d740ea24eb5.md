## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Field Medic I establishes the Bone-Setter's identity as the **master of preparation**. This foundational passive ensures their medical supplies are always superior quality and that they never enter the field empty-handed.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** +1 bonus die to all Field Medicine crafting checks
- **Secondary:** Guarantees starting resources (3 Standard Healing Poultices per expedition)
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The consummate professional who is always prepared

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Moderate for Tier 1 passive (crafting bonus + starting resources)
- **Preparation Loop:** Reinforces downtime crafting as core gameplay loop
- **Resource Baseline:** Ensures Bone-Setter is never completely ineffective

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Bone-Setter's kit is a work of art—bandages rolled precisely, instruments cleaned and ordered, herbs sorted by potency and application. Years of practice have honed their preparation rituals into an almost meditative discipline. Before every expedition, they check their supplies three times, because a medic without resources is just another mouth to feed.

### Thematic Resonance

In Aethelgard, the difference between life and death often comes down to having the right supplies at the right moment. The Bone-Setter ensures that moment never comes unprepared.
