## Thematic Description

> *"You move with deliberate, measured steps, testing each surface before committing weight. In ruins, haste is death."*
> 

The Careful Advance is the foundational movement technique of all Ruin-Stalkers. Every step is tested, every surface evaluated, every shadow checked. This methodical approach sacrifices speed for **guaranteed safety**—and in Old World ruins, that trade-off saves lives.

## Synergies

### Internal (Ruin-Stalker Tree)

- **Anomaly Sense I**: Detection informs where to step carefully
- **Disarm Mechanism**: Careful Advance reveals traps for disarming
- **Hazard Mapping**: Routes discovered via Careful Advance become permanent maps
- **Safe Extraction Protocol**: Emergency speed when Careful Advance isn't viable

### External (Party Composition)

- **Heavy armor users**: Benefit most from guided movement (poor individual stealth)
- **Low-WITS characters**: Rely on your path-finding expertise
- **Large parties**: Rank 3 simultaneous guidance prevents stragglers

## Tactical Applications

### Standard Exploration Protocol

1. Activate Careful Advance
2. Move at half/full speed with bonus
3. Party follows your exact footsteps
4. Mark any hazards encountered
5. Repeat until area cleared

### Rank 3: Party Guidance

At Rank 3, the entire party moves as a unit:

- No need for single-file following
- All members receive your full bonus
- Hazards automatically marked for everyone
- Efficient exploration without splitting attention

### Sustained Use

No cooldown means Careful Advance can be your **default exploration mode**:

- 15 Stamina per use is sustainable
- Use continuously in dangerous areas
- Switch to normal movement in cleared zones
