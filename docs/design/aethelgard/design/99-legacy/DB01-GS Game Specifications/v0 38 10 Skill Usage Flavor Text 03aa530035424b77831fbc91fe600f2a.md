**Parent Specification:** [v0.38: Descriptor Library & Content Database](v0%2038%20Descriptor%20Library%20&%20Content%20Database%200a9293f3a9b44c968a36c0a429ab841d.md)

**Status:** Design Phase

**Timeline:** 12-15 hours

**Goal:** Build comprehensive skill check descriptor library for non-combat actions

**Philosophy:** Every skill check tells a story of expertise, struggle, and consequence

---

## I. Purpose

v0.38.10 creates **Skill Usage Flavor Text**, making every non-combat action vivid:

- **80+ Skill Check Descriptors** (per skill type)
- **40+ Success/Failure Variations** (by degree)
- **30+ Fumble Consequences** (catastrophic failures)
- **20+ Critical Success Descriptors** (masterful execution)

**Strategic Function:**

Currently, skill checks are mechanical:

- ❌ "Lockpicking check: Success. The door opens."
- ❌ No sense of character expertise or struggle
- ❌ Missed environmental storytelling opportunities

**v0.38.10 Solution:**

- Degree-of-success descriptions (barely vs. masterfully)
- Tool usage details
- Environmental context integration
- Time/effort indicators
- Fumble consequences with story impact

---

## II. Core Skills Overview

**From Rune & Rust setting:**

1. **System Bypass** (WITS) - Lockpicking, hacking, disarming traps
2. **Acrobatics** (FINESSE) - Climbing, leaping, balancing, stealth
3. **Wasteland Survival** (WITS) - Tracking, foraging, navigation
4. **Rhetoric** (WILL) - Persuasion, deception, intimidation

## III. System Bypass Descriptors

### Mechanical Locks

### Attempt Descriptions

**Simple Lock:**

- "You kneel before the lock, examining the mechanism with your picks."
- "You insert your tools, feeling for the tumblers inside."
- "You probe the lock carefully, mapping its interior structure."

**Complex Lock (Jötun Engineering):**

- "This is Jötun craftsmanship—precision engineering. You steady your hands."
- "The lock mechanism is complex. This will require patience and skill."
- "You count at least seven tumblers. This won't be quick."
- "Centuries-old mechanisms that still function perfectly. Impressive... and difficult."

**Corroded/Damaged Lock:**

- "Rust has seized parts of the mechanism. You'll need to work around the corrosion."
- "The lock is damaged, parts of it fused together. This complicates things."
- "Age has not been kind to this lock. Some tumblers are completely corroded."

### Success by Degree

**Minimal Success (1-2 over DC):**

- "After several tense minutes, the lock finally yields. Your hands are cramping."
- "You barely manage to align the tumblers. The lock clicks open, but you're sweating."
- "With great effort, you coax the mechanism open. That was harder than expected."
- "You're not sure how, but... yes, the lock is open. Barely."

**Solid Success (3-5 over DC):**

- "Your picks find their marks efficiently. The lock opens with a satisfying click."
- "You work methodically through the tumblers. Within moments, the lock surrenders."
- "The mechanism yields to your expertise. The door is yours to open."
- "One by one, the pins fall into place. The lock opens smoothly."

**Critical Success (6+ over DC):**

- "You open the lock so smoothly, it's as if you had the key. Masterful work."
- "Your fingers dance through the mechanism with perfect precision. The lock never stood a chance."
- "You barely even need to look—your hands know exactly what to do. The lock opens instantly."
- "The lock opens in seconds. Child's play."
- "You could do this blindfolded. The mechanism practically opens itself under your expert touch."

### Failure by Degree

**Close Failure (1-2 under DC):**

- "Almost... but the last tumbler won't set. You withdraw your picks, frustrated."
- "You think you have it, but the mechanism refuses to turn. Not quite."
- "So close—but close doesn't open locks. You'll need to try again."
- "One pin away from success, but that one pin might as well be a mountain."

**Clear Failure (3-5 under DC):**

- "The lock's complexity defeats you. You withdraw your picks, stymied."
- "You can't make sense of this mechanism. It's beyond your current skill."
- "After several minutes of fruitless effort, you accept that this lock is too advanced."
- "The mechanism resists all your attempts. You're not getting through this way."

**Fumble Consequences:**

**Broken Tool:**

- "Your pick snaps off inside the lock! The broken piece jams the mechanism."
- "A fumbled movement—your tool breaks with a sharp *crack*. The lock is now harder to open. [+2 DC for next attempt]"
- "You drop your pick, and it falls into the mechanism where you can't retrieve it."

**Triggered Alarm:**

- "Something clicks wrong. You hear a distant bell begin to ring—an alarm!"
- "Your clumsy attempt triggers a hidden mechanism. Lights flash red throughout the corridor!"

**Analyzing Mechanism:**

- "You trace the wires to their source. This trap connects to... ceiling collapse charges. Dangerous."
