## Ability Overview

| --- | --- |
| **Specialization** | Skald (Chronicler of Coherence) |

## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Oral Tradition I establishes the Skald's identity as a **master of historical knowledge and persuasive speech**. This foundational passive ensures the Skald excels in social and investigative situations from the moment of specialization unlock.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Skill enhancement for Rhetoric and historical investigation
- **Secondary:** Gates lore-based content and dialogue options
- **Progression Hook:** Sets up Oral Tradition II (Tier 2) and Oral Tradition III (Tier 3)

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Low-moderate (appropriate for Tier 1 passive)
- **Comparison:** Equivalent to Jötun-Reader's Scholarly Acumen I but focused on social/historical rather than technical domains
- **Scaling:** Bonus die scales well into late game due to dice pool mechanics

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Skald's training begins not with performance, but with **listening**. Before they can craft sagas that inspire, they must absorb the broken fragments of the world's story. They spend years cataloguing oral histories, memorizing the genealogies of fallen clans, and learning to speak in the cadences that resonate with survivors.

### Thematic Resonance

In a world where written records were corrupted by the Glitch, oral tradition becomes the most reliable repository of truth. The Skald is a living library—their mind a vault of knowledge that cannot be hacked or scrambled.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Effect

**Permanent Passive Bonus:**

- Gain **+1 bonus die (+1d10)** to all **Rhetoric** skill checks
- Gain **+1 bonus die (+1d10)** to all **Investigation** checks related to **historical events, genealogies, or cultural traditions**

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Trigger:** Player initiates a Rhetoric check OR historical Investigation check
2. **Validation:** System confirms Oral Tradition I is active
3. **Application:** Add +1d10 to the dice pool before rolling
4. **Resolution:** Proceed with standard skill check resolution

### Edge Cases

- **Stacks with Equipment:** Yes, bonus die stacks with equipment bonuses
- **Stacks with Other Abilities:** Yes, stacks with situational bonuses from other sources
- **Affected by Status Effects:** No—passive is always active unless Skald is [Unconscious]

## IV. Progression Path

### Rank 1 (Base — This Ability)

- +1 bonus die to Rhetoric and historical Investigation

### Rank 2 (Expert — 20 PP)

*Future Enhancement: Oral Tradition II*

- +2 bonus dice to Rhetoric and historical Investigation
- Unlock dialogue options that reveal hidden lore

### Rank 3 (Mastery — Capstone)

*Future Enhancement: Oral Tradition III*

- +3 bonus dice to Rhetoric and historical Investigation
- Can spend Stamina to automatically succeed on historical knowledge checks

---

## V. Tactical Applications

1. **Social Encounters:** Skald becomes the party face for negotiations, persuasion, and intimidation
2. **Lore Discovery:** Enables identification of pre-Glitch artifacts, faction histories, and hidden locations
3. **Quest Unlocks:** Some quests require historical knowledge checks that only a Skald can reliably pass
4. **Information Gathering:** Enhanced Rhetoric improves information extraction from NPCs
5. **Reputation Building:** Success in social encounters builds faction reputation faster

---

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Jötun-Reader (Scholarly Acumen):** Combined, covers both technical and historical knowledge domains
- **High-WITS builds:** Bonus die multiplies value of already-high WITS
- **Faction quests:** Many faction storylines gate behind Rhetoric checks

### Negative Synergies

- **Combat-focused parties:** Ability provides no combat benefit
- **Low-WITS builds:** Bonus die less impactful with small dice pools
