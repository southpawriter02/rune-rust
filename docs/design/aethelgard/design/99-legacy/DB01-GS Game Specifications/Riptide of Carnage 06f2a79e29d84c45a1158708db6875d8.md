## Thematic Description

> *"For one span in a clash, the raider de-syncs from common rhythm, striking in rapid succession as if from several places at once."*
> 

Riptide of Carnage is the **ultimate expression** of the Strandhögg's mastery. You slip between moments, moving and striking faster than the eye can follow—but the cost is paid in mind and margin.
