## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Demoralizing Diatribe is the Thul's **signature psychological attack**—a barrage of scathing logic and recounted failures that shatters enemy confidence. This establishes the Thul's identity as a master of mental warfare.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Inflict [Disoriented] on intelligent enemy for 2 rounds
- **Secondary:** Core control ability defining Thul's combat role
- **Targeting Restriction:** Only affects intelligent enemies (not mindless)
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The devastating verbal assault that breaks will to fight

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High ([Disoriented] is potent debuff)
- **Intelligence Requirement:** Creates clear weakness vs mindless enemies
- **Opposed Check:** Can fail against high-WILL targets

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Thul unleashes a torrent of words—not insults, but **truths**. They recount the target's clan's past failures with perfect clarity. They expose the logical flaws in the enemy's tactics. They predict, step by step, how this fight will end in the target's defeat.

The words are not magical, but they are devastating. Every statement is verifiable, every logical point is sound. The enemy's confidence doesn't just waver—it **shatters** under the weight of undeniable truth.

### Thematic Resonance

The Thul doesn't fight with weapons; they fight with words. In a world where narrative shapes reality, a perfectly constructed argument is as deadly as a sword.
