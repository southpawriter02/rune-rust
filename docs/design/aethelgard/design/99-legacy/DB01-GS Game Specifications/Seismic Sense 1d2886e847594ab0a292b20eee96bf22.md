## Thematic Description

> *"The ground whispers of footfalls yet to come; listen, and you will never be surprised."*
> 

Seismic Sense represents the Gorge-Maw's **deep attunement** to the earth. Through vibrations in the ground, you detect movement and presence that eyes cannot see. The earth itself becomes your sensory network.
