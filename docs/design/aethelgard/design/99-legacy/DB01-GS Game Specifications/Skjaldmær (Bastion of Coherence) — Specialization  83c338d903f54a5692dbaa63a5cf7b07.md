### **I. Core Philosophy: The Bastion of Coherence**

In a world where reality itself is a glitching, corrupted program, the **Skjaldmær** is more than a wall of steel; she is a **bastion of coherence**. Her role has evolved beyond merely protecting the body to the far more critical task of shielding the very sanity of her allies. She stands against the Runic Blight not with complex understanding, but with an unyielding, simple, and profound truth: "This is my shield. This is my clan. This reality will break before I do."

Her power comes from her indomitable **Will**, which she channels into her shield, transforming it from a simple piece of armor into a grounding rod—a metaphysical firewall against the eternal psychic scream of the Great Silence. Her saga is not just written in the blows she blocks, but in the minds she keeps from shattering.

### **II. Player-Facing Presentation**

- **Role:** Quintessential Tank, Sanity Anchor, Defensive Bulwark
- **Primary Attribute:** STURDINESS (for raw survivability and HP pool)
- **Secondary Attribute:** WILL (to project coherence and resist mental assault)
- **Gameplay Feel:** The Skjaldmær's gameplay is a selfless and strategic act of controlling the battlefield through protection. They are the party's immovable anchor, deciding where danger is allowed to land. Playing a Skjaldmær is about understanding threat priority, positioning to maximize protection, and managing both physical and mental resources. Success is measured not in enemies defeated, but in allies who return home intact in body and mind.

### **II. Core Functionality and Mechanics: The Shield as a Firewall**

The Skjaldmær's gameplay is built on three interconnected pillars:

**Pillar 1: The Unbreachable Wall (Physical Defense)**

- **Feature:** Unparalleled mastery of the shield for personal defense.
- **Specification:** The Skjaldmær is a fortress of **Soak** and resilience, capable of weathering devastating physical blows that would obliterate other specializations.

**Pillar 2: The Aegis of the Clan (Physical & Metaphysical Protection)**

- **Feature:** Protection extends beyond the self.
- **Specification:** The Skjaldmær's taunts are a projection of pure, unwavering will—a beacon of sanity that draws the attention of insane, corrupted things. Abilities grant allies temporary bulwarks against horrors that assault both body and mind.

**Pillar 3: The Bastion of Sanity (Psychic Stress Mitigation)**

- **Feature:** This is the Skjaldmær's defining pillar—the party's **sanity anchor**.
- **Specification:** Many abilities are designed to absorb, redirect, or reduce incoming **Psychic Stress**, making the Skjaldmær an indispensable component for any expedition into Blight-saturated ruins.
- **Rationale:** Transforms the tank role from "meat shield" to "reality anchor." The Skjaldmær protects not just HP, but sanity—the game's most valuable resource.

### **IV. The Skill Tree: The Protector's Oath**

The Skjaldmær's skill tree is built around shield mastery, aggro control, and Psychic Stress mitigation.

### **Tier 1 (Foundational Resolve)**

*Prerequisite: Unlock the Skjaldmær Specialization (10 PP)*

- **`Sanctified Resolve I`** (Passive)
    - **Description:** The Skjaldmær's training begins not with strength, but with mental fortitude. She learns to ground her spirit, finding a quiet center amidst the world's chaotic noise.
    - **Mechanics:**
        - **Effect:** Provides a permanent **bonus die (+1d10)** to all **WILL-based Resolve Checks** against **[Fear]** and **Psychic Stress**.
        - **Rationale:** Establishes mental fortress identity. The Skjaldmær must be unshakeable to protect others.
- **`Shield Bash`** (Active)
    - **Description:** The Skjaldmær slams their shield into a foe—a blow of pure, undeniable physical truth in a world of glitches. It is a brutal, declarative statement of reality.
    - **Mechanics:**
        - **Cost:** 40 Stamina.
        - **Effect:** Deals low Physical damage to a single target.
        - **Control Effect:** On a Solid or Critical Success, also inflicts the **[Staggered]** effect.
        - **Rationale:** Basic attack with crowd control component. Establishes shield-as-weapon identity.
- **`Oath of the Protector`** (Active)
    - **Description:** The Skjaldmær speaks a solemn vow, extending their protective aura to an ally. Their shield becomes a symbol of this oath, a promise to shield both flesh and mind.
    - **Mechanics:**
        - **Cost:** 35 Stamina.
        - **Effect:** Grants a single ally a significant bonus to both their **Soak value** and their **Resolve Checks against Psychic Stress** for 2 turns.
        - **Formula:** +2 Soak, +1 die to Psychic Stress Resolve Checks.
        - **Rationale:** Core single-target protection ability. Dual physical/mental protection establishes unique identity.

### **Tier 2 (Advanced Guardianship)**

*Prerequisite: 8 PP spent in the Skjaldmær tree*

- **`Guardian's Taunt`** (Active)
    - **Description:** Banging her weapon against her shield, the Skjaldmær bellows a challenge. It is a projection of pure, coherent will into the static of the battlefield—a signal of sanity so strong that even the most maddened creatures are drawn to it.
    - **Mechanics:**
        - **Cost:** 30 Stamina.
        - **Effect:** The Skjaldmær attempts to **Taunt** all enemies in the Front Row for 2 rounds.
        - **Effective Against Corrupted:** This ability is effective even on creatures normally resistant to mental effects.
        - **Psychic Cost:** The act of drawing the world's trauma to herself is taxing, causing the Skjaldmær to immediately gain a **small amount of Psychic Stress**.
        - **Rationale:** AoE taunt with drawback. Embodies selfless sacrifice—absorbs both physical and mental threat.
- **`Shield Wall`** (Active)
    - **Description:** The Skjaldmær plants her feet, creating a temporary bastion of physical and metaphysical stability. Allies instinctively rally to this anchor of coherence.
    - **Mechanics:**
        - **Cost:** 45 Stamina.
        - **Effect:** For 2 turns, the Skjaldmær and all adjacent allies in the Front Row gain:
            1. A large bonus to their **Soak value** (+3)
            2. **Resistance to Push/Pull** effects
            3. A **bonus die (+1d10)** to all Resolve Checks against **Psychic Stress**
        - **Rationale:** Formation-based defensive cooldown. Rewards positional play and party coordination.
- **`Interposing Shield`** (Reaction)
    - **Description:** As a devastating blow is about to land on an ally, the Skjaldmær moves with surprising speed, throwing their shield in the path of the attack.
    - **Mechanics:**
        - **Cost:** 25 Stamina (Reaction).
        - **Frequency:** Once per round.
        - **Effect:** When an adjacent ally is about to be hit by a Critical Hit, the Skjaldmær can redirect the attack to themselves, taking 50% of the damage.
        - **Rationale:** Classic tank reaction. Skill-based protection that rewards awareness.

### **Tier 3 (Mastery of the Bulwark)**

*Prerequisite: 20 PP spent in the Skjaldmær tree*

- **`Implacable Defense`** (Active)
    - **Description:** The Skjaldmær achieves a state of perfect focus. She becomes an unmovable object—her will a fortress against both the physical world and the glitching reality that seeks to unmake her.
    - **Mechanics:**
        - **Cost:** 40 Stamina.
        - **Duration:** 3 turns.
        - **Effect:** The Skjaldmær gains **Immunity** to:
            - All physical control effects ([Stun], [Staggered], [Knocked Down])
            - All mental control effects ([Fear], [Disoriented])
        - **Rationale:** Ultimate stability cooldown. Ensures Skjaldmær can hold the line under any conditions.
- **`Aegis of the Clan`** (Passive)
    - **Description:** The Skjaldmær's protective instincts become second nature. The sight of a struggling ally's fracturing mind triggers an immediate, overwhelming need to protect them.
    - **Mechanics:**
        - **Effect:** The first time an ally's **Psychic Stress** meter enters the "High" threshold each combat, the Skjaldmær automatically applies the effect of **Oath of the Protector** to that ally for 1 turn, **free of cost**.
        - **Rationale:** Automatic clutch save. Rewards attentive play and reinforces sanity anchor identity.

### **Capstone (Ultimate Expression)**

*Prerequisite: 40 PP spent in the Skjaldmær tree*

- **`Bastion of Sanity`** (Passive / Reaction)
    - **Description:** The Skjaldmær transcends the role of a mere warrior to become a living Runic Anchor—a walking kernel of stable code. Her presence is a constant, calming hum of coherence in a world of static, and in a moment of ultimate crisis, she can absorb a reality-shattering blow meant for another.
    - **Mechanics:**
        - **Passive Aura:** While in the Front Row, the Skjaldmær emits an **Aura of Coherence**. All allies in her row gain:
            1. A permanent, small bonus to their **WILL** (+1)
            2. **Passively reduced Psychic Stress** from environmental sources (-10% Stress gain)
        - **Reaction:** Once per combat, when an ally would gain a permanent **Trauma** from reaching maximum Psychic Stress, the Skjaldmær can trigger this ability:
            - The ally does not gain the Trauma.
            - The Skjaldmær takes a **massive amount of Psychic Stress** and **1 Runic Blight Corruption**, absorbing the psychic backlash to save her comrade from a permanent scar.
        - **Rationale:** Ultimate selfless protection. The Skjaldmær can literally take a mental bullet for an ally, preventing permanent consequences at great personal cost.

### **V. Systemic Integration**

**1. Core Role & Fantasy Fulfillment**

- The Skjaldmær is the quintessential tank and the party's sanity anchor.
- Fantasy delivered: Unbreachable wall, protector of both body and mind, living bastion of coherence.

**2. Trauma Economy Interaction**

- **Coherent Specialization:** The Skjaldmær has low self-inflicted Trauma risk (only Guardian's Taunt and the capstone reaction have Psychic costs).
- **Protective Role:** Actively mitigates party Psychic Stress through Oath of the Protector, Shield Wall, Aegis of the Clan, and Bastion of Sanity aura.
- **Ultimate Sacrifice:** The capstone reaction allows the Skjaldmær to take Trauma/Corruption to save an ally—thematically powerful and mechanically significant.
- **Synergy:** Essential for high-risk parties (Berserkr, Echo-Caller, Jötun-Reader) who accumulate Psychic Stress rapidly.

**3. Situational Power Profile**

- **Optimal Conditions:**
    - High-damage encounters where taunt and damage absorption are critical
    - Blight-heavy environments where Psychic Stress is a major threat
    - Protecting fragile, high-value allies (Bone-Setter, Jötun-Reader, casters)
    - Formation-based combat where Shield Wall can protect multiple allies
- **Weakness Conditions:**
    - Solo play (all abilities are party-focused protection)
    - Low-threat encounters (protection is overkill)
    - Ranged-heavy parties that don't benefit from front-row positioning
- **Hard Counters:** High burst damage enemies that threaten fragile allies; Psychic Stress-heavy environments
- **Hard Countered By:** Armor-piercing attacks that bypass Soak; crowd control that prevents reactions; enemies that ignore taunts

**4. Synergies**

- **Positive Synergies:**
    - **Berserkr/Vargr-Born** (aggressive Warriors): Protects reckless melee fighters, allowing them to play aggressively
    - **Bone-Setter/Skald** (supports): Forms complete defense triangle (Skjaldmær prevents damage, Bone-Setter heals damage, Skald prevents Stress)
    - **Jötun-Reader/Echo-Caller** (high-Stress specialists): Critical for managing their self-inflicted Psychic Stress
    - **Formation-based builds:** Shield Wall maximizes value with coordinated positioning
- **Negative Synergies:**
    - Solo/mobile strikers (Einbúi, Ruin-Stalker) gain less from protection
    - Other tanks create role redundancy

**5. Archetype Fulfillment**

- **Archetype:** Warrior
- **Sub-Role:** Pure Tank (Aggro Control/Damage Absorption), with secondary role as Support (Trauma Economy management)
- **Warrior Identity:** Straightforward, selfless protection with clear mechanical and thematic focus on being the party's anchor
