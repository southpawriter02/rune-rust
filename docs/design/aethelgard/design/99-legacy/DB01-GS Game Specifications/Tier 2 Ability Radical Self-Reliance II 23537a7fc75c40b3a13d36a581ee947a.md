## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Radical Self-Reliance II is the **second pillar of the Einbúi's versatile expertise**—mastery over navigating man-made ruins. They have learned the art of the ghost: moving silently through treacherous corridors and scaling crumbling walls.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** +2 bonus dice to Stealth checks
- **Secondary:** +2 bonus dice to Climbing/Balancing checks
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The ghost of the ruins who moves unseen

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High (reliable utility bonuses)
- **Scout Role:** Enables party scouting and bypass
- **FINESSE Synergy:** Rewards attribute investment

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Einbúi has spent years navigating the treacherous ruins alone. They've learned to **move like a shadow**, to find handholds where none should exist, to slip past dangers that would destroy a less experienced survivor.

The ruins are not obstacles. They are **home**.

### Thematic Resonance

Radical Self-Reliance II completes the jack-of-all-trades fantasy—with both passives, the Einbúi is competent in four critical exploration skills.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Skill Bonuses

**Passive Effect:**

- +2 bonus dice to **Acrobatics (Stealth)** checks
- +2 bonus dice to **Acrobatics (Climbing/Balancing)** checks

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Trigger:** Character attempts qualifying skill check
2. **Passive Check:** Does character have Radical Self-Reliance II?
3. **Context Validation:** Is this a Stealth or Climbing check?
4. **Bonus Application:** If yes, add +2 dice to pool

---

## IV. Progression Path

### Rank 1 (Base — This Ability)

- +2 dice to Stealth and Climbing

### Rank 2 (Expert — 20 PP)

- +4 dice to Stealth and Climbing

### Rank 3 (Mastery — Capstone)

- +4 dice to Stealth and Climbing
- **New:** +1 dice to ALL out-of-combat skills (via Ultimate Survivor)

---

## V. Tactical Applications

1. **Scouting:** Move ahead to identify threats
2. **Stealth Bypass:** Avoid unnecessary encounters
3. **Vertical Exploration:** Access hidden areas via climbing
4. **Ambush Setup:** Position party for surprise attacks

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Radical Self-Reliance I:** Combined = 4 skill mastery
- **High FINESSE:** Massive Stealth dice pools
- **Exploration campaigns:** Essential for dungeon delving

### Negative Synergies

- **Combat focus:** No direct combat benefit
- **Party-dependent:** Scouting value requires coordination
