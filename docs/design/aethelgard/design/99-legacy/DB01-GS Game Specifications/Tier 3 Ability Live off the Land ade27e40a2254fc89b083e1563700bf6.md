## Core Identity

**Live off the Land** makes you one with wilderness. Where others see barren wasteland, you see **abundance**. Edible fungi, water-holding plants, game den locations. **The wilderness is no longer hostile—it is home.**

---

## Mechanics

### Always Active

**1. No Ration Requirement:**

- Never consume [Rations] during rests
- Auto-forage enough food for yourself
- No [Exhausted] from hunger

**2. Water Finder:**

- Once per day: Find [Clean Water] for entire party
- Works in barren/desert environments
- Wasteland Survival check (varies by environment)

**3. Automatic Foraging:**

- Gain **1d3 [Common Herbs]** whenever foraging
- No check required, automatic
- Provides steady crafting components

**4. Party Ration Efficiency:**

- Party consumes **25% fewer Rations**
- You supplement with foraged food
- Extends expedition duration significantly

### Rank Progression

| Rank | PP Cost | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 5 | Base effects, 25% ration reduction |
| 2 | 35 | 1d4 herbs, 35% ration reduction |
| 3 | 50 | 1d6 herbs, 50% reduction, party never needs rations |

## Tactical Applications

**Expedition Economics:**

```
═══ STANDARD EXPEDITION ═══

Without Einbúi:
├─ 5 party members × 5 days = 25 Rations needed
├─ Cost: 50 gold
└─ Weight: 25 encumbrance

With Karla (Rank 1):
├─ Karla: 0 Rations consumed
├─ Others: 20 Rations × 75% = 15 Rations needed
├─ Cost: 30 gold (40% savings!)
└─ Weight: 15 encumbrance

Economic Impact: 20 gold saved per 5-day expedition
```

**Synergies:**

- **Master Improviser:** Auto-herbs fuel upgraded concoctions
- **Wasteland Wanderer:** Combined = thrive anywhere
- **Resourceful Eye:** Total resource independence

## Failure Modes

<aside>
⚠️

**Urban/Indoor Environments** — Sealed vaults, mechanical facilities offer zero organics. Auto-foraging produces nothing in sterile environments.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Variance Deficit** — 1d3 average = 2 herbs/day. If crafting 3+/day, consumption outpaces generation. "Automatic" ≠ "unlimited."

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Contaminated Water** — Finding water doesn't guarantee purity in Blighted areas. Always purify in Corruption zones.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Party Dependency** — If Einbúi incapacitated, ration supplementation vanishes. Always provision for worst-case.
