## Thematic Description

> *"You read the weakness before you load the answer. A twitch of the servos, a discoloration in the carapace, a hitch in the breath—you see what reagent will break them."*
> 

The Alka-hestur's combat effectiveness begins with **analysis**. Before the lance strikes, before the cartridge fires, you've already read the target's chemistry—identified the elemental fault line that your payload will exploit.

## Mechanical Implementation

### Base Effect (Rank 1)

- +1d10 bonus to **WITS checks** for identifying creature vulnerabilities and resistances
- On successful analysis, learn **one vulnerability OR one resistance**

### Rank 2

- +2d10 bonus
- Learn **all vulnerabilities OR all resistances** (choose one)
- **PP Cost**: 3

### Rank 3

- +3d10 bonus
- Learn **ALL vulnerabilities AND resistances**
- **Party Bonus**: Party members gain +1d10 damage vs analyzed target's vulnerabilities
- **PP Cost**: 3

## Analysis Output Examples

### Rank 1: Single Result

```
Target: Corrupted Servitor
Analysis: Vulnerable to [EMP]
```

### Rank 2: Category Result

```
Target: Corrupted Servitor
Vulnerabilities: [EMP], [Acidic]
```

### Rank 3: Full Profile

```
Target: Corrupted Servitor
Vulnerabilities: [EMP], [Acidic]
Resistances: [Fire], [Ice]
Party gains +1d10 vs EMP/Acidic attacks
```

## Synergies

### Internal (Alka-hestur Tree)

- **Payload Strike**: Analysis informs payload selection
- **Targeted Injection**: Weakness knowledge enables triple damage
- **Perfect Solution**: Capstone builds on analysis foundation

### External (Party Composition)

- **Jötun-Reader**: Combined analysis = complete enemy profile
- **Elemental damage dealers**: Your analysis boosts their targeting
- **Party coordination**: Share weakness information for focus fire

---

## Tactical Applications

### Pre-Combat Protocol

1. Identify priority targets
2. Roll WITS + Alchemical Analysis bonus
3. Learn vulnerabilities/resistances
4. Load optimal payloads from rack
5. Engage with informed strikes

### Rank 3: Party Force Multiplier

+1d10 damage for the entire party against identified vulnerabilities transforms you into a **tactical coordinator**:

- Call out weaknesses in combat
- Direct party elemental attacks
- Maximize overall damage output
