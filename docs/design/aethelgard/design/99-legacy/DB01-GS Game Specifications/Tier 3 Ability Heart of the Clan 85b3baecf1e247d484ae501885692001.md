## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Heart of the Clan creates a **passive defensive aura** that enhances allies' Resolve Checks against Psychic Stress. This positions the Skald as a **constant morale anchor** without requiring Performance activation.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** +1 bonus die to defensive Resolve Checks for row-mates
- **Secondary:** Reduces party Psychic Stress accumulation
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The clan-heart whose mere presence inspires courage

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Moderate (conditional positioning)
- **Always Active:** No activation cost, but requires positioning
- **Limitation:** Same-row only (forces tactical positioning decisions)

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Skald doesn't need to speak to project courage. Their very presence—the quiet confidence of someone who has catalogued a thousand sagas of survival—radiates stability. Those who stand beside them feel the weight of all those stories, the accumulated wisdom of survivors who faced the worst and endured.

### Thematic Resonance

In Aethelgard, proximity to coherent narrative sources is protective. The Skald is a **walking library of survival stories**, and simply being near them is like standing in the shelter of an ancient oak—the roots of legend run deep.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Passive Aura Effect

**All allies in the same row as the Skald gain:**

- **Resolve Bonus:** +1 bonus die (+1d10) to all **defensive Resolve Checks** against Psychic Stress

### Scope of Effect

**Defensive Resolve Checks include:**

- Resisting fear effects
- Resisting demoralization
- Resisting Psychic Stress from environmental sources
- Resisting Psychic Stress from enemy abilities

**Does NOT affect:**

- Offensive Resolve Checks (intimidation, etc.)
- Self-inflicted Psychic Stress (ability costs)

### Position Tracking

- **Dynamic:** Effect updates immediately when Skald or allies change rows
- **Skald Position:** Can be in any row; affects only row-mates
- **Skald Included:** Skald also benefits from their own aura

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Trigger:** Ally in Skald's row makes defensive Resolve Check vs Psychic Stress
2. **Proximity Check:** Confirm ally is in same row as Skald
3. **Application:** Add +1d10 to ally's Resolve Check dice pool
4. **Resolution:** Proceed with standard Resolve Check resolution

### Edge Cases

- **Multiple Skalds:** Auras don't stack (only one +1d10 bonus applies)
- **[Unconscious] Skald:** Aura deactivates while Skald is unconscious
- **Solo Skald:** Skald benefits from own aura even without allies

## IV. Progression Path

### Rank 1 (Base — This Ability)

- +1 bonus die to defensive Resolve Checks for row-mates
- Passive, always active

### Rank 2 (Expert — 20 PP)

- +1 bonus die to defensive Resolve Checks for row-mates
- **New:** Also grants +1 bonus die to offensive Resolve Checks (intimidation)
- **New:** Aura range extends to adjacent rows (not just same row)

### Rank 3 (Mastery — Capstone)

- +2 bonus dice to all Resolve Checks for row-mates
- Aura affects entire party regardless of row
- **New:** First Psychic Stress event per combat for each ally in aura is reduced by 3

---

## V. Tactical Applications

1. **Formation Planning:** Position Skald in row with most vulnerable allies
2. **Back Row Protection:** Protect fragile Jötun-Readers and ranged specialists
3. **Front Row Tanking:** Support Skjaldmær's already-high WILL with bonus die
4. **Constant Coverage:** Unlike Performances, never requires action economy
5. **Stress-Heavy Encounters:** Essential for Blight-saturated dungeons

---

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Saga of Courage:** Stacks with Performance bonus for massive Resolve bonuses
- **Skjaldmær (Bastion of Sanity):** Combined auras create near-immunity to Psychic Stress
- **Jötun-Reader:** Helps manage self-inflicted Stress from analysis abilities
- **Berserkr:** Compensates for typically low WILL score

### Negative Synergies

- **Split Formations:** Value decreases when party is spread across multiple rows
- **Mobile Builds:** Characters who change rows frequently get inconsistent coverage
