### **I. Core Philosophy: The Anchor of a Broken Narrative**

The **Skald** is the Adept specialization that embodies the philosophy that in a world whose own story has been shattered, **a coherent narrative is a weapon and a shield**. They are not mystics, but coherence-keepers—the warrior-poets who understand that stories are a source of immense, tangible power.

To choose the Skald is to embrace the fantasy of the inspirational leader and the keeper of legends. Your saga is written in the courage you instill in your allies and the despair you inflict upon your foes.

### **II. Player-Facing Presentation**

- **Role:** Morale Officer, Combat Buffer/Debuffer, Living Encyclopedia
- **Primary Attribute:** WILL (for force of personality)
- **Secondary Attribute:** WITS (for vast repository of lore)
- **Gameplay Feel:** Pure, dedicated support class whose power is entirely auditory. A "non-magical bard" who maintains powerful party-wide buffs (Sagas) or enemy debuffs (Dirges).

### **III. Mechanical Implementation: The Art of the Performance**

**A. Core Mechanic: Performance**

- Initiating a Performance is a **Standard Action** costing **Stamina**
- Enters **[Performing]** status—a channeled state
- Duration: Rounds equal to **WILL** score
- While [Performing], can move and use items but cannot use another Standard Action
- **Interruption:** Stunned or Silenced ends Performance immediately

### **IV. The Skill Tree: The Repertoire of a Legend**

**Tier 1 (Foundational Performance)**

- **Oral Tradition I** (Passive) — Bonus die to Rhetoric and historical investigation
- **Saga of Courage** (Performance) — Allies immune to [Feared], +1 die to WILL Resolve Checks
- **Dirge of Defeat** (Performance) — Intelligent enemies suffer -1 die to Accuracy and damage

**Tier 2 (Advanced Composition)**

- **Rousing Verse** (Active) — Instantly restore Stamina to single ally
- **Song of Silence** (Active) — Inflict [Silenced] on enemy caster
- **Enduring Performance** (Passive) — +2 rounds to all Performance durations

**Tier 3 (Mastery of the Saga)**

- **Lay of the Iron Wall** (Performance) — Front Row allies gain +2 Soak
- **Heart of the Clan** (Passive) — Allies in same row gain +1 die to defensive Resolve Checks

**Capstone**

- **Saga of the Einherjar** (Performance) — Once per combat. All allies gain [Inspired] (+3 damage dice) and temporary HP. When it ends, allies suffer Psychic Stress.

### **V. Systemic Integration**

**Trauma Economy:** Coherent specialization. Proactive defense against Trauma Economy via Saga of Courage. Complements Bone-Setter (Skald prevents Stress; Bone-Setter heals it).
