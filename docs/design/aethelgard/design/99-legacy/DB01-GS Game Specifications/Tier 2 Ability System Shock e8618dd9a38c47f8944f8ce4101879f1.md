## Description

You thrust your hand forward, sending a jolt of pure entropy directly into a machine's inner workings. The entropic code injection causes a cascade of internal failures—gears seize, circuits short, logic loops collapse. For a moment, the machine is completely paralyzed as its corrupted system struggles to parse the impossible instructions you've injected.
