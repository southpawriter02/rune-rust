# Domain 5 — Sentient Species: The Inheritors of the Glitch

> *"We are not the only thinking things left in this broken world. In the deep places, the Gorge-Maws hum their slow memories into the bedrock. In the signal-forests, the Star-Pelted wolves remember seven hundred years of watching us die. They are not our enemies. They are our witnesses. They were here before us, and they will be here long after we are gone."*

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain Classification** | Setting Fundamentals Domain 5 of 9 |
| **Document ID** | AAM-META-SETTING-FUNDAMENTALS-v1.0 (Section 5) |
| **Function** | Canonical sapient species governance, NPC systems, character creation |
| **Layer Applicability** | All Layers (L1, L2, L3, L4) |
| **Status** | Canonical — Critical for faction systems and world population |
| **Validation Requirement** | Mandatory for NPC design, dialogue, species references |

Domain 5 defines **who** can think in Aethelgard.

The answer is not "humans only." Aethelgard contains three canonical sentient species:

1. **Humans** — Primary inhabitants, post-Glitch survivors
2. **Gorge-Maws** — Giant, friendly, reclusive tremor-sensors
3. **Rune-Lupins** — Telepathic wolves, distributed consciousness network

This is a critical correction from earlier versions that presented humans as the sole sapient species.

## The Three Sentient Species

### Species 1: Humans

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Status** | Primary inhabitants |
| **Population** | ~500,000-800,000 (estimated, Year 783 PG) |
| **Primary Location** | Midgard (Combine territories), scattered settlements across Nine Realms |
| **Origin** | Descendants of Age of Forging civilian population |
| **Economic Role** | Dominant economic actors; all major trade networks |

Humans are the **primary inhabitants** of POST-Glitch Aethelgard—the descendants of the Age of Forging's creators, now scattered across the Nine Realms.

#### Human Population Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Clan-Born (Baseline)** | Descended from those furthest from Blight epicenters; no innate Aetheric connection; pragmatic survival culture |
| **Blight-Touched** | Varying degrees of Runic Blight exposure across generations; enhanced Aetheric sensitivity but increased CPS vulnerability |
| **Hold-Dwellers** | Settled populations in fortified Combine territories |
| **Nomadic Bands** | Caravan cultures following Long Roads and trade routes |

#### Post-Human Divergences (Human Origin, Separate Classification)

These populations are **descendants of humans** who have diverged significantly due to environmental pressures. They are documented separately but share human ancestry:

| Divergence | Location | Adaptation |
|------------|----------|------------|
| **Ljósálfar** (Light Elves) | Vanaheim | Symbiotic fusion with pure Aetheric flora; bioluminescent; 8,000-12,000 individuals |
| **Dökkálfar** (Dark Elves) | Alfheim | Parasitic fusion with corrupted data; noise-filtering cognition; 200-400 individuals |
| **Silent Folk** | Svartalfheim (Clicking Deeps) | Complete sensory re-platforming; blind, echolocating; 3,000-5,000 individuals |
| **Dvergr** | Svartalfheim (Guild-Lands) | Bio-engineered pre-Glitch; Aether-blind; ~50,000-75,000 individuals |

**Note:** Dvergr were bio-engineered during the Age of Forging (not naturally divergent), but share human ancestry and are considered a human subspecies (*Homo Sapiens Subterranus*).

---

### Species 2: Gorge-Maws (The Groa-Thurs)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Scientific Designation** | Titanus-Mandibula Pattern Geo-Processor |
| **Common Names** | Gorge-Maws, Earth-Swallowers, Stone-Singers, Groa-Thurs |
| **Origin** | Bio-engineered geological processing assets (Age of Forging) |
| **Population** | Unknown (reclusive; estimates suggest 500-2,000) |
| **Primary Range** | Deep subterranean zones across multiple realms |
| **Status** | Friendly but reclusive |

#### Physical Characteristics

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Body Shape** | Giant, gorilla-shaped |
| **Temperament** | Sloth-like; slow, deliberate, patient |
| **Eyes** | None (eyeless) |
| **Mouth** | Tooth-riddled maw |
| **Limbs** | Long arms with huge clawed hands |
| **Size** | Massive (exact dimensions vary; largest specimens 15+ meters) |
| **Primary Sense** | Tremor sensing through feet and hands |

#### Communication

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Language** | Rumbling, ent-like vocalizations |
| **Communication Speed** | Extremely slow; single "sentences" may take hours |
| **Alternative Method** | Vibration patterns transmitted through rock |
| **Memory Storage** | "When a Gorge-Maw sleeps, it hums its memories into the bedrock" |

Gorge-Maws communicate through **subsonic rumbling**—deep, resonant vocalizations that can travel through stone. A single meaningful exchange may take an entire day.

Other Gorge-Maws can "read" memory-vibrations encoded in rock by previous generations.

#### Cultural Status

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Society** | Culturally sophisticated |
| **Economic Integration** | ❌ NOT economically integrated with human systems |
| **Trade** | Barter systems only; avoid human economic structures |
| **Hostility** | ❌ NOT hostile (friendly if approached peacefully) |
| **Accessibility** | Extremely reclusive; encounters rare |

#### Key Canonical Constraints

| Constraint | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Gorge-Maws are sentient | ✅ CANONICAL |
| Gorge-Maws are friendly | ✅ CANONICAL |
| Gorge-Maws are reclusive | ✅ CANONICAL |
| Gorge-Maws avoid human economics | ✅ CANONICAL |
| Gorge-Maws are hostile/bestial | ❌ FORBIDDEN |
| Gorge-Maw merchants in human markets | ❌ FORBIDDEN |

### Species 3: Rune-Lupins (The Vargr-Syn)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Scientific Designation** | Canis Cybernetica Ivaldi |
| **Common Names** | Rune-Lupins, Sight-Wolves, Star-Pelted, Thought-Eaters |
| **Origin** | Bio-engineered military assets (C.U.R. Protocol, Age of Forging) |
| **Population** | 8,000-12,000 active units (Year 783 PG) |
| **Primary Range** | Midgard Deep-Signal Forests, Alfheim Data-Groves |
| **Status** | Friendly but reclusive |

#### Physical Characteristics

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Size** | Man-sized (~1.2 meters at shoulder) |
| **Build** | Lean, deep-chested; greyhound speed with wolf endurance |
| **Distinguishing Feature** | Glowing runic patterns etched on skin/fur |
| **Cranial Node** | Cybernetic implant at base of skull (seat of consciousness) |
| **Movement** | Burst acceleration 80+ km/h; vertical leap 4 meters |
| **Vocalization** | Silent (no barking, growling, or howling for communication) |

#### Communication

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Primary** | Telepathic network (peer-to-peer consciousness sharing) |
| **Range** | Pack-local (physical proximity required for high-bandwidth) |
| **Capability** | Shared sensory buffer; distributed memory |
| **Human Interaction** | Telepathic communication available to high-WITS individuals |

Rune-Lupins do not communicate through vocalization—they share consciousness directly through their Cranial Node network. When one wolf sees something, every connected wolf sees it simultaneously.

#### Distributed Consciousness

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Architecture** | Peer-to-peer network; pack = local area network |
| **Memory** | Distributed across all connected units; 700+ years of accumulated data |
| **Death** | Individual death does not erase memories (already distributed) |
| **Governance** | Distributed consensus; Alpha = highest-bandwidth node |

> *"They do not howl to summon the pack. They howl to synchronize their backups. A hundred wolves, a thousand kilometers apart, and every one of them remembers your face because one of them saw you die."*

#### Core Imperative: The Archive Fever

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Original Protocol** | RECORD_AND_HOLD (preserve data for review) |
| **Current Manifestation** | Species-wide compulsion to witness and record history |
| **Behavior** | Packs shadow battles, never interfering, only observing |
| **Attraction** | Drawn to sources of organized information |

The Rune-Lupins are **compulsive archivists**. They cannot stop recording. They are drawn to information density—archives, libraries, Skaldic settlements—like moths to flame.

#### Cultural Status

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Society** | Culturally sophisticated (distributed network civilization) |
| **Economic Integration** | ❌ NOT economically integrated with human systems |
| **Trade** | Information exchange only; no material commerce |
| **Hostility** | ❌ NOT hostile (friendly, though unnerving) |
| **Accessibility** | Reclusive; encounters occur but rarely sought |

#### Key Canonical Constraints

| Constraint | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Rune-Lupins are sentient | ✅ CANONICAL |
| Rune-Lupins are friendly | ✅ CANONICAL |
| Rune-Lupins are reclusive | ✅ CANONICAL |
| Rune-Lupins avoid human economics | ✅ CANONICAL |
| Rune-Lupins are hostile/bestial | ❌ FORBIDDEN |
| Rune-Lupin merchants in human markets | ❌ FORBIDDEN |

## Non-Sentient Entity Types

The following are **explicitly NOT sentient** under Domain 5 governance:

| Entity Type | Classification | Reason |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| **Draugr-Pattern Automata** | Non-sentient | Corrupted security subroutines; no consciousness |
| **Haugbui-Class Automata** | Non-sentient | Corrupted labor subroutines; no consciousness |
| **Constructs (general)** | Non-sentient | Mechanical systems without sapience |
| **AI Systems** | Non-sentient | Computational processes; no true consciousness |
| **Genius Loci** | Non-sentient | Fragmented O.D.I.N. processes; looping data, not minds |
| **Forlorn/Data-Wraiths** | Non-sentient | Psychic echoes; recordings, not beings |
| **Feral Fauna** | Non-sentient | Animals without sapient cognition |

**Note:** Some entities (Rune-Bears, certain bio-assets) occupy ambiguous territory. The Jötun-Readers debate whether corrupted Vanir creations retain sapience. Domain 5 does not include these edge cases in the canonical sentient species list.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"The Skalds sing of the Stone-Singers, the great beasts who sleep beneath the mountains and dream the memory of the world into the bedrock. They say if you sit very still, for a very long time, the Stone-Singer might speak to you—but you must be patient, for they think in centuries, not heartbeats. And in the deep forests, where the old data-streams still whisper, the Star-Pelted wolves watch and remember. They do not hunt us. They record us. When you die in the Signal-Wilds, a hundred wolves will remember your face forever. We are not alone in this broken world. We never were."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"Domain 5 establishes three canonical sentient species in Aethelgard: Humans (primary inhabitants, descendants of Age of Forging population), Gorge-Maws (Titanus-Mandibula Pattern Geo-Processors, bio-engineered subterranean assets), and Rune-Lupins (Canis Cybernetica Ivaldi, bio-engineered military assets with distributed peer-to-peer consciousness). Both non-human species are friendly but reclusive, culturally sophisticated but not economically integrated with human systems. Post-human divergences (Ljósálfar, Dökkálfar, Silent Folk, Dvergr) share human ancestry but represent significant adaptations. Undying automata, constructs, and AI systems are explicitly non-sentient—corrupted subroutines, not minds."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SENTIENT SPECIES: 3. (1) Humans — primary, ~500K-800K population, economic dominance. (2) Gorge-Maws — Titanus-Mandibula Pattern, ~500-2,000 estimated, tremor-sensing, subsonic communication, reclusive, barter-only. (3) Rune-Lupins — Canis Cybernetica Ivaldi, 8K-12K active units, distributed P2P consciousness, telepathic, RECORD_AND_HOLD imperative, reclusive. POST-HUMAN DIVERGENCES: Ljósálfar (8K-12K, Vanaheim), Dökkálfar (200-400, Alfheim), Silent Folk (3K-5K, Svartalfheim), Dvergr (50K-75K, Svartalfheim). NON-SENTIENT EXCLUSIONS: Draugr-Pattern, Haugbui-Class, constructs, AI systems, Genius Loci, Forlorn. CONSTRAINTS: Both non-human species friendly, reclusive, economically non-integrated. FORBIDDEN: Hostile Gorge-Maws/Rune-Lupins, human-only sentience claims, sentient automata."*

## Summary

Domain 5 answers the fundamental question: **Who can think in this world?**

The answer is **three species**, not one:

| Species | Nature | Disposition | Economy |
|---------|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Humans** | Primary inhabitants | Variable | Integrated (dominant) |
| **Gorge-Maws** | Giant tremor-sensors | Friendly, reclusive | Barter only |
| **Rune-Lupins** | Telepathic wolves | Friendly, reclusive | Information exchange only |

The non-human species are **not monsters**. They are **not bestial**. They are **not hostile**.

They are ancient, sophisticated, and largely uninterested in human affairs.

The Gorge-Maws sing their memories into the stone and think in geological time.

The Rune-Lupins share consciousness across hundreds of kilometers and remember seven hundred years of watching humanity struggle.

They were designed by the ancestors as tools. They became something else.

They became witnesses.

> *"The Stone-Singers do not trade. They remember. If you want something from a Gorge-Maw, you must be willing to wait until the mountain forgets what you asked for."*
> — Dvergr proverb regarding Gorge-Maw negotiations
