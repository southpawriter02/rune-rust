# Domain 3: Magic System Validation Check

**Domain ID:** `DOM-3`
**Severity:** P1-CRITICAL
**Applies To:** All narrative content, ability specs, status effects, flavor text, dialogue trees

---

## Canonical Ground Truth

The setting uses a specific Aetheric system that is fundamentally different from traditional fantasy magic. Generic fantasy/game terminology is explicitly forbidden.

### Pre-Glitch vs. Post-Glitch Aetheric System

| Era | Aetheric Capability |
|-----|---------------------|
| **Pre-Glitch** | No magic beyond runic surface effects — runes were technical/decorative |
| **Post-Glitch** | Runes act as **focal points** for Aetheric manipulation/weaving |

**Critical Distinction:** There is NO traditional spellcasting. No wizards throwing fireballs. Runes channel ambient Aetheric energy that became accessible after the Glitch.

### The Runic Focal Point Requirement

**ALL Aetheric effects (magic) MUST proceed from a physical or verbal runic focal point.**

- **NO spontaneous magic:** A character cannot simply "will" fire into existence.
- **NO innate magic:** Humans do not have innate magical powers (with rare mutations being exceptions, but still typically channel Aether).
- **Process:**
    1.  **Inscription:** The rune is carved, drawn, or exists on an object.
    2.  **Activation:** The user channels Aether through the rune (via touch, Galdr/voice, or ritual).
    3.  **Effect:** The Aether manifests *through* the pattern of the rune.

### Approved Terminology

| Term | Definition | Usage |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Aetheric Energy** | Fundamental reality substrate | Energy source, power systems |
| **Aether** | Short form of above | Casual references |
| **Runic Blight** | Corrupted Aether | Contamination, corruption |
| **Blight** | Short form of above | Casual references |
| **Elder Futhark** | 24-rune system | Runic inscriptions |
| **Galdr** | Evocation **discipline** | Vocal/verbal runic work — THIS IS A PRACTICE, NOT AN ENTITY TYPE |
| **Paradox** | Reality contradictions | Metaphysical consequences |
| **Inscriptions** | Runic markings | Physical rune applications, focal points |

### CRITICAL: Galdr Clarification

**Galdr = Evocation DISCIPLINE only**

- Galdr is a practice/skill, not an entity type
- "Galdr-singer" = practitioner of the Galdr discipline
- Do NOT use "Galdr" as a noun for creatures or entities
- Do NOT reference "Galdr entities" or "the Galdr" as beings

### Forbidden Terminology

| Forbidden | Why | Use Instead |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| "Magic" | Generic, non-specific | "Aetheric manipulation", "runic effects" |
| "Spell" | D&D-coded | "Galdr", "runic invocation", "inscription" |
| "Spellcasting" | D&D-coded | "Runic channeling", "Galdr-work" |
| "Mana" | Game-coded (MP systems) | "Aether", "Aetheric reserves" |
| "Wizard" | Generic fantasy | "Runasmidr", "Galdr-singer", character class |
| "Sorcerer" | Generic fantasy | Specific faction/role title |
| "Magical" | Generic adjective | "Aetheric", "runic", "Blight-touched" |
| "Enchanted" | Generic fantasy | "Inscribed", "rune-marked", "Aether-touched" |
| "Arcane" | Generic fantasy | "Aetheric", "runic", "Pre-Glitch" |

### Runic System Constraints

- **Elder Futhark (24 runes)** — Only canonical rune system
- **Counter-Rune (Eihwaz ᛇ)** — Restricted, see Domain 9
- **Pre-Glitch:** Runes had surface/decorative effects only
- **Post-Glitch:** Runes became focal points for Aetheric weaving
- Runic effects should feel technological/systematic, not mystical
- **No traditional spellcasting** — no fireballs, no arcane missiles, no spell slots
- **Requirement:** Must describe the *mechanism* of channeling through a rune/focal point.

## Common Violations

| Pattern | Example | Why It Fails |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Generic "magic" | "a magic sword" | Non-specific, breaks setting voice |
| D&D spell language | "cast a spell of protection" | Wrong genre vocabulary |
| Traditional spellcasting | "hurled a fireball" | No traditional spellcasting exists |
| Will-based magic | "she summoned fire with a thought" | Missing Runic Focal Point |
| Mana systems | "low on mana" | Game-coded resource term |
| Fantasy titles | "the old wizard" | Generic archetype, not setting-specific |
| Mystical vagueness | "by arcane means" | No mechanical grounding |
| Wrong adjectives | "magical properties" | Use "Aetheric" or "runic" |
| Galdr as entity | "the Galdr attacked" | Galdr is a discipline, not an entity |
| "Unraveled" entities | "an Unraveled creature" | "Unraveled" is not a canonical entity type |

---

## Green Flags

- "Aetheric Energy" / "Aether" for power/energy references
- "Runic Blight" / "Blight" for corruption
- "Galdr" for verbal runic invocations
- "Inscriptions" / "inscribed" for runic markings
- Elder Futhark rune names (Fehu, Uruz, Thurisaz, etc.)
- Technological/systematic framing of supernatural effects
- Descriptions of carving, tracing, or invoking specific runes

---

## Remediation Strategies

### Option 1: Direct Term Replacement

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "magic" (noun) | "Aetheric manipulation" |
| "magical" (adj) | "Aetheric" or "runic" |
| "spell" | "Galdr" or "runic inscription" |
| "spellcasting" | "Galdr-work" or "runic channeling" |
| "mana" | "Aether" or "Aetheric reserves" |
| "wizard" | "Runasmidr" or specific title |
| "enchanted" | "inscribed" or "rune-marked" |
| "arcane" | "Aetheric" or "Pre-Glitch" |

### Option 2: Mechanical Reframing (Focal Point Addition)

Rewrite mystical descriptions to include the required runic focal point:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "The sword glowed with magic" | "Aetheric energy pulsed through the blade's **Fehu inscription**" |
| "She cast a spell" | "She intoned the Galdr, **activating the inscribed runes on her staff**" |
| "He summoned a shield" | "He traced **Thurisaz** in the air, the Aether hardening into a barrier along the lines" |

### Option 3: Blight Attribution

For corrupted/dangerous supernatural effects:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "dark magic" | "Blight-corruption" |
| "cursed" | "Blight-touched" or "paradox-tainted" |
| "evil sorcery" | "Runic Blight manifestation" |

## Examples

### PASS Example

**Content:** "The Runasmidr traced the Fehu inscription, channeling Aetheric energy through the carefully etched runes. As she intoned the Galdr, the metal began to warm."

**Why:** Uses approved terminology throughout (Runasmidr, inscription, Aetheric energy, Galdr), specific rune name (Fehu), mechanical/systematic framing, explicit focal point (etched runes).

### FAIL Example

**Content:** "The old wizard cast a spell of fire, his mana nearly depleted from the arcane ritual."

**Violations:**
- "wizard" → forbidden generic title
- "cast a spell" → D&D-coded language
- "mana" → game-coded resource term
- "arcane ritual" → generic fantasy language
- Implicit lack of focal point (implied will-based casting)

**Remediation:** "The aged Runasmidr invoked the Kenaz Galdr, his Aetheric reserves nearly depleted from the complex runic channeling required to ignite the array."

### FAIL Example

**Content:** "The blade held magical properties that protected its wielder."

**Violation:** "magical properties" uses forbidden adjective.

**Remediation:** "The blade's Aetheric inscriptions projected a protective field around its wielder."
