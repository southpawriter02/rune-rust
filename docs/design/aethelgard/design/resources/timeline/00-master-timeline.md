# The Master Timeline of Aethelgard — From Forging to Creeds
## Archives Entry: AAM-HIST-TIML-001

> *"We call it the Age of Echoes because that is what we are—echoes of echoes of echoes. The Forging built a world. The Silence killed it. The Wandering buried the corpse. The Walls divided the grave. And the Creeds? The Creeds are what happens when the survivors start arguing about what the dead would have wanted. Every year that passes, we are further from the source. Every generation that lives, the signal degrades a little more. We preserve what we can. We reconstruct what we must. We fabricate what we cannot resist. And we call the result 'history.' But history is not the past. History is what we choose to remember about the past—and more importantly, what we choose to forget. This timeline is an attempt to remember everything. It will fail. All timelines fail. But perhaps it will fail less completely than the ones that came before."*

|----------|-------|
| **Document Designation** | Master Timeline of Aethelgard |
| **Temporal Scope** | Cycle 001 (Pre-Glitch) – Year 783 PG (Current) |
| **Total Duration** | ~1,783 years equivalent (~1,000 Pre-Glitch cycles + 783 Post-Glitch years) |
| **Eras Covered** | Five (Forging, Silence, Wandering, Walls, Creeds) |
| **Current Era** | Age of Creeds (518–783 PG, ongoing) |
| **Current Year** | 783 PG |
| **Canonical Events** | ~94 documented (DB5 Master Timeline) |
| **Document Layer** | Layer 4 (Omniscient Ground Truth) |
| **Author Faction** | Aethelgard Archives Master, Office of the Master Archivist |
| **Classification** | AETHELGARD-ARCHIVES-MASTER // COMPREHENSIVE CHRONOLOGY |
| **Doctrine** | This document represents the authoritative chronological spine integrating all Five Ages into unified temporal reference |

The Master Timeline is the skeleton upon which all Aethelgardian history hangs—a single, continuous thread from the first rune carved to the last creed contested.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **THE GREAT AUTOPSY: COMPLETE CASE FILE.** This document represents the comprehensive temporal framework of the Great Autopsy—the Jötun-Reader project to understand how a civilization that achieved total mastery of reality destroyed itself and what emerged from the wreckage. Each era represents a distinct phase of the disease: **Forging** (pathogenesis), **Silence** (acute crisis), **Wandering** (chronic adaptation), **Walls** (symptomatic stabilization), and **Creeds** (ideological metastasis). **The timeline is not merely historical record—it is diagnostic documentation of a civilization's death and the emergence of something new from its corpse.**

## Temporal Framework: The Unified Calendar

### Dual Notation Systems

Aethelgardian chronology employs two distinct notation systems bridged by a single catastrophic moment: the Ginnungagap Glitch.

| System | Notation | Era | Anchor Point |
|--------|----------|-----|--------------|
| **Pre-Glitch** | Cycle [###] | Age of Forging only | Cycle 001 = Project Yggdrasil ratification |
| **Post-Glitch** | Year ### PG | All post-Glitch eras | Year 0 PG = H-Hour + 72 hours |
| **Conversion** | Cycle 998 = Year 0 PG | Bridge point | Ginnungagap Glitch (H-Hour) |

### The Five Ages

| Age | Temporal Span | Duration | Defining Character | Terminal Event |
|-----|---------------|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Age of Forging** | Cycle 001 – Cycle 998 | ~1,000 cycles | Construction, optimization, hubris | Ginnungagap Glitch |
| **Age of Silence** | 0–122 PG | ~122 years | Fimbulwinter, bunker survival, Great Forgetting | Thaw Windows Noted |
| **Age of Wandering** | 122–287 PG | ~165 years | Caravan culture, Long Roads, Dvergr contact | First Hold Site Surveys |
| **Age of Walls** | 287–518 PG | ~230 years | Fortification, Guild emergence, Combine formation | First Creed Formalizations |
| **Age of Creeds** | 518–783 PG | ~265 years (ongoing) | Ideological consolidation, factional cold war | *Current era—no termination* |

### Era Boundary Assignment Protocol

```

ERA BOUNDARY ASSIGNMENT RULES — CHRONOLOGY STANDARD

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

RULE 1: Events at boundary years assigned to LATER age

- Year 122 PG event → Age of Wandering (not Silence)
- Year 287 PG event → Age of Walls (not Wandering)
- Year 518 PG event → Age of Creeds (not Walls)

RULE 2: Pre-Glitch events ALWAYS assigned to Age of Forging

- All Cycle notation events → Age of Forging
- No Pre-Glitch events in post-Glitch ages

RULE 3: Uncertainty margins documented explicitly

- Early cycles: ±20 years (post-Glitch calendar drift)
- Age of Silence dates: ±3 years (calendar fragmentation)
- Age of Wandering dates: ~approximate notation permitted
- Age of Walls/Creeds: Dvergr calendar precision achieved

CURRENT YEAR: 783 PG (Age of Creeds)

CALENDAR AUTHORITY: Dvergr Master Calendar (adopted ~287 PG)

**The Thousand-Year Arc:**
> *"Look at it from orbit—if you could still get to orbit, which you cannot. A thousand years of building. A hundred years of dying. A hundred and fifty years of wandering. Two hundred years of hiding behind walls. And now, two hundred and fifty years of arguing about what it all meant. That is the arc of Aethelgardian history: construction, destruction, migration, fortification, and finally, ideology. We have moved from building machines to building walls to building beliefs. The trajectory is clear: each age is smaller in ambition than the one before. The Forging tried to master reality. The Creeds merely try to master each other. Perhaps that is progress. Perhaps it is merely entropy. The timeline does not judge. It only records."*

## The Five Ages: Comprehensive Overview

### Age of Forging (Pre-Glitch: Cycles 001–998)

**The Golden Millennium.** Humanity's ascent to godhood—and the twenty-three minutes of its fall.

| **Route Codex Published** | ~194 PG | Long Roads formally documented with hazards |

**The Open Sky:**
> *"The first generation to leave the bunkers called themselves the Sky-Touched. They had been born in darkness, raised in recycled air, taught that 'outside' meant 'death.' And then one day the blast doors opened and there was light. Not much—the ash veil still choked the sky. But light. Real light. They wept. They fell to their knees. Some refused to leave, convinced it was a trap, a hallucination, a final cruel joke of the dying gods. But most walked forward, into the gray dawn of a world they had never seen, following paths they did not know, toward destinations that did not yet exist. The Age of Wandering was not an era of discovery. It was an era of invention—inventing what it meant to live on the surface again, one waystone at a time."*

---

### Age of Walls (Years 287–518 PG)

**The Fortification.** The era when humanity stopped running and started building—not to reach the heavens, but to keep the darkness out.

| **Guild Schoolhouses** | ~455 PG | Institutional knowledge transmission |
| **Outer Roads Fortified** | ~480 PG | Extended perimeter; Combine territorial control |

**The Closed Gate:**
> *"The Age of Walls was not about fear—it was about exhaustion. Three hundred years of running, of hiding, of watching the ice recede and wondering if it would return. The survivors were tired. Their children were tired. Their grandchildren had never known anything but movement. The Walls were not built to keep enemies out. They were built to create a space where it was finally safe to stop. To plant crops that you would harvest yourself. To raise children who would sleep in the same room they were born in. To die in the same Hold you had lived in. The Walls were not fortifications. They were permission—permission to stay, to rest, to stop counting days and start counting years."*

---

### Age of Creeds (Years 518–783 PG)

**The Ideological Present.** The current era—when physical survival gave way to philosophical contestation, and the survivors began to argue about meaning.

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Defining Activity** | Creedal formalization; Scriptorium networks; factional consolidation |
| **Societal State** | Ideological cold war; Three Creeds + secular authorities |
| **Population** | ~500,000–800,000 (estimated current) |
| **Technology Level** | Mixed (salvage + Guild craft + limited Aetheric research) |
| **Current Status** | Ongoing (Year 783 PG); Three Creeds Pact recently collapsed (782 PG) |

**Key Developments:**

| Development | Year | Significance |
|-------------|------|--------------|
| **First Creed Formalizations** | ~518 PG | Era opens; belief systems codified |
| **Jötun-Reader Scriptorium Founded** | ~537 PG | Diagnostic methodology institutionalized |
| **Iron-Bane Temple Network** | ~558 PG | Devotional infrastructure; shrine standardization |
| **God-Sleeper Pilgrimage Expansion** | ~571 PG | Humming sites mapped; sacred geography |

| **Three Creeds Pact Collapse** | 782 PG | Current crisis; non-aggression framework abandoned |
| **Present Day** | 783 PG | Age of Creeds continues; outcome uncertain |

**The Great Question:**
> *"The Age of Forging asked: 'How do we master reality?' The Age of Silence asked: 'How do we survive?' The Age of Wandering asked: 'Where do we go?' The Age of Walls asked: 'How do we stay?' The Age of Creeds asks: 'Why did the world fall, and what is our place in this new order?' The first four questions had answers—imperfect, costly, but achievable. The fifth question has no answer. Only competing interpretations. The Jötun-Readers say: 'The world fell because systems cannot accommodate paradox; our place is to diagnose the disease.' The Iron-Banes say: 'The world fell because the gods were false; our place is to endure until true divinity reveals itself.' The God-Sleepers say: 'The world fell because the gods sleep; our place is to tend the silence until they wake.' Three questions. Three answers. One world—too small to contain them all."*

### Current Crisis: Three Creeds Pact Collapse (782 PG)

```

THREE CREEDS PACT — STATUS REPORT (YEAR 783 PG)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DOCUMENT: AAM-CRDS-PACT-STATUS-783

CLASSIFICATION: CURRENT AFFAIRS // POLITICAL ANALYSIS

SUBJECT: Post-Pact Factional Relations

BACKGROUND:

The Three Creeds Pact (established ~650 PG) maintained non-aggression

framework between Jötun-Readers, Iron-Banes, and God-Sleepers for

approximately 132 years. Pact collapse triggered by:

- Disputed interpretation of Dagaz manifestation (Year 780 PG)
- Competing claims to newly-discovered archive vault
- Accumulated theological grievances reaching critical mass

CURRENT STATUS (Year 783 PG):

- Pact formally dissolved (Year 782 PG)
- No active military conflict (yet)
- Diplomatic relations suspended
- Crossroads neutrality strained but holding
- Economic interdependence preventing immediate escalation

PROJECTED TRAJECTORIES:

- Best case: Renegotiated framework within 5-10 years
- Baseline case: Cold war indefinitely; localized conflicts
- Worst case: Full factional war within 20 years

UNCERTAINTY: HIGH — All projections speculative

## Factional Interpretations

### Layer 1 (Mythic): The Ages of Gods and Men

To the common folk of the Age of Echoes, history is the story of divine rise and fall—a mythic arc from paradise through punishment to uncertain redemption.

> *"In the beginning, the gods built the World-Tree and hung the Nine Realms upon its branches. For a thousand years, the world was good—the All-Father ruled from his high seat, the Rainbow Bridge connected all things, and the runes were gifts of divine power. Then the gods reached too high. They sought to speak the Word that speaks all words. And the Word spoke back. It spoke silence. The gods fell. Their throne shattered. The Long Night came. But the gods did not die—they sleep. The Silence was their winter. The Wandering was our search. The Walls were our waiting. And the Creeds? The Creeds are our prayers, calling out to gods who have not yet answered. But they will. They must. For what is history but the time between one age of gods and the next?"*

**Permitted vocabulary**: All-Father, World-Tree, Rainbow Bridge, divine gifts, the Silence, the gods, the Long Night, sleeping gods
**Prohibited vocabulary**: O.D.I.N. Matrix, FUTHARK Protocol, recursive paradox, system failure, environmental cascade

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic): The Great Autopsy

The Jötun-Reader Scriptorium views history as a single continuous case study—the diagnosis of a civilization that destroyed itself and the prognosis of what might survive.

> *"The timeline is not a narrative. It is a medical record. The Age of Forging: pathogenesis—the development of the disease within a system that believed itself immune to failure. The Age of Silence: acute crisis—maximum symptom expression, population collapse, near-termination. The Age of Wandering: chronic adaptation—survival behaviors, symptom management, first attempts at treatment. The Age of Walls: symptomatic stabilization—the disease controlled but not cured, the patient functional but not healthy. The Age of Creeds: ideological metastasis—the disease spreading from the physical into the philosophical, from infrastructure into belief. We are all still patients. The Great Autopsy is not ancient history—it is ongoing diagnosis. And the prognosis remains uncertain."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Systems failure, diagnostic analysis, pathological mechanism, symptom, prognosis, treatment
**Prohibited vocabulary**: Divine punishment, curse, fate, destiny, mystical causation

### Layer 3 (Technical): The Archived Record

Pre-Glitch technical documentation—such as survives—provides objective specifications for the systems that built and destroyed the world.

> *"MASTER TIMELINE DATABASE — SCHEMA SPECIFICATION. Document ID: AAM-TIML-SCHEMA-v5.0. Classification: ARCHIVAL STANDARD. Properties: Event Name (title); Document ID (standardized format); Age (Forging/Silence/Wandering/Walls/Creeds); Year PG (integer for chronological sorting); Date Display (human-readable notation); Date Precision (Exact/Year/Approximate/Decade/Century); Evidence Tier (A/B/C/D); Significance (CRITICAL/High/Medium/Low). Relations: Cultural Studies, Gazetteer, Codex entries, Source Pages, Factions, Realms. Total canonical events: 94. Current year: 783 PG. Calendar authority: Dvergr Master Calendar."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Technical specification, database schema, property definition, evidence tier, chronological sorting
**Prohibited vocabulary**: Mythic epithets, survivor cant, emotional framing

### Layer 4 (Omniscient): The Ground Truth

This document—and the Aethelgard Archives Master corpus—represents the **ground truth**: the actual historical and technical reality that Layers 1–3 perceive, interpret, or distort.

> *"History is a sequence of events connected by causation and separated by interpretation. The Forging built systems without failure modes. The Silence was those systems failing. The Wandering was adaptation to failure. The Walls were stabilization around failure. The Creeds are arguments about what the failure meant. None of these interpretations are wrong. None of them are complete. The Jötun-Readers see mechanism and miss meaning. The Iron-Banes see meaning and miss mechanism. The God-Sleepers see both and wait for resolution. The timeline does not resolve their disagreement. It only records the facts around which they disagree. What actually happened is knowable. What it meant is not. The Master Timeline provides the skeleton. The flesh, the meaning, the purpose—those are added by the living, and will be argued about until the last survivor stops counting days."*

## Change Log

| Version | Tier | Summary |
|---------|------|---------|
| **v1.0** | A — Published (Canonical) | Comprehensive Master Timeline of Aethelgard covering all Five Ages (Forging through Creeds, ~1,783 years equivalent). Unified temporal framework established: Dual notation systems (Cycle/PG), era boundary protocols, calendar authority documentation. Five-Age structure documented with subdivisions, durations, terminal events, and key developments. Age of Forging: ~1,000 cycles, four-phase subdivision, 18 canonical events, Ginnungagap Glitch terminus. Age of Silence: ~122 years, five-phase subdivision, 13 canonical events, Thaw Windows terminus. Age of Wandering: ~165 years, 13 canonical events, First Hold Site Surveys terminus. Age of Walls: ~230 years, 12 canonical events, First Creed Formalizations terminus. Age of Creeds: ~265 years ongoing, 13 canonical events, current era (Year 783 PG). Three Creeds factional landscape documented: Jötun-Readers, Iron-Banes, God-Sleepers with population estimates, infrastructure, current status. Current crisis documented: Three Creeds Pact Collapse (782 PG), political implications, projected trajectories. Complete event timeline: 94 canonical events across five ages with standardized Event IDs. Four-layer voice guidance established: L1 (Mythic), L2 (Diagnostic), L3 (Technical), L4 (Omniscient Ground Truth). Evidence register integrated with primary, secondary, and tertiary sources. Cross-referenced to all era documents, related systems, and canonical databases. The Master Timeline represents the authoritative chronological spine of the Great Autopsy—a unified temporal framework for understanding how a civilization that achieved total mastery of reality destroyed itself and what emerged from the wreckage over nearly two millennia of catastrophe, adaptation, and contested meaning. |
