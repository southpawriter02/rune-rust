# The Iron-Bane Crusade — Surgeons of the Soul

> *"The Skalds sing of us as the great Purifiers, the grim, soot-stained crusaders whose hymns are the ring of a hammer and whose prayers are the roar of a forge-fire. The Jötun-Readers call us barbarians. The God-Sleepers call us blasphemers. But we are the inheritors of the Aesir's righteous fury and their most terrible certainty: the belief that some things are too dangerous to exist."*
> — Forge-Lord Thyra, Chapter of the Scouring Flame

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Classification** | Major Creed (One of Three) |
| **Common Names** | The Purifiers, The Antivirus, Surgeons of the Soul |
| **Core Philosophy** | Purification Through Destruction |
| **Primary Settlements** | Pure Forges (fortified forge-monasteries) |
| **Leadership Structure** | Militant hierarchical faith |
| **Relationship to Blight** | Destroy, purge, cleanse |

The Iron-Banes are the ultimate, violent rejection of the Aesir's technological legacy. They are a militant, ascetic, and fanatical faith that views the remnants of the Age of Forging not as broken tools or sleeping gods, but as **demonic corruption** that must be systematically exterminated.

They are not scientists or scholars.

They are the antivirus of a broken world, and their Great Work is to find and delete every last corrupted file.

## Core Dogma: The World Is Sick, Not Broken

### The Iron-Curse

| Jötun-Readers Say | God-Sleepers Say | Iron-Banes Know |
|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| "The machines are malfunctioning tools." | "The machines are sleeping gods." | "The machines are demons in iron bodies." |
| "Understand the system error." | "Worship the divine remnants." | "Destroy the spiritual plague." |
| "Debug and rebuild." | "Pray and await awakening." | "Purify and cleanse." |

The Iron-Banes believe the world is not broken—it is **gravely sick**. It suffers from a spiritual affliction known as the **Iron-Curse**: an ancient plague born from the blasphemous fusion of metal and spirit.

> *"The Jötun-Forged are not machines; they are the iron bodies of demons. The Undying are their soulless spawn. The Aether is the poison that gave them un-life. The Runic Blight is not a compiler error—it is spiritual corruption made manifest."*

### The Great Work of Purification

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Goal** | Total destruction of all pre-Glitch technology |
| **Method** | Holy crusades; fire-cleansing; ritual purification |
| **Sacred Duty** | To leave a single Undying is to let a plague fester |
| **Timeline** | Perpetual; until every Iron Heart is extinguished |

The Iron-Banes see themselves as the world's **surgeons**. The patient is dying of a spiritual cancer, and the only cure is radical excision—cutting out every last trace of the corrupted tissue, no matter how painful the procedure.

---

## Origins: The Survivors Who Fought Back

### Who They Were

The founders of the Iron-Banes were not scholars or civilians who hid from the end of the world.

| Pre-Glitch Role | Post-Glitch Contribution |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Security forces | Combat expertise; tactical discipline |
| Civil defense militias | Organizational structure; siege warfare |
| Guards and protectors | Hatred born from betrayal |
| First responders | Understanding of the machines' danger |

They were the ones who **fought**. They stood their ground as their own automated protectors turned on them. They watched the Vörðr-drones that had once guided their children slaughter their neighbors. They saw the Einherjar, their greatest heroes, become the architects of their ruin.

### The Founding Trauma

When the Great Silence fell, their first, instinctual act was not to save the data or to pray for salvation.

It was to pick up a piece of rebar and **fight back**.

Their creed was forged in the trauma of ultimate betrayal. The machines they had trusted—built, maintained, celebrated—turned on them in a single, incomprehensible moment. This betrayal did not teach them fear.

It taught them **hatred**.

### The First Pure Forge

In the Age of Wandering, these scattered, hardened survivors found each other. Their shared, burning hatred of the machine proved a more powerful bond than any old allegiance. They founded the first Pure Forge, and the Iron-Bane Crusade began.

---

## Theology: The Heresy of Knowledge

### The Poison of Understanding

| What Jötun-Readers Seek | What Iron-Banes Know |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Understanding of the past | Some doors are best left sealed |
| Recovery of lost knowledge | Some books are best left to burn |
| Technical solutions | The solution IS destruction |
| The "source code" | The code itself is the curse |

The Iron-Banes view the "tainted knowledge" of the ancestors with profound and violent distrust. They believe the Jötun-Readers' attempt to understand the past is the **ultimate heresy**—a fool's errand that risks repeating the very mistake that broke the world.

> *"A wise man fears three things: the Runic Blight that twists the soul, the pride of a heretic that twists the law, and the word of the Silent God that twists the truth."*

### The Five Ages of the World

The Iron-Banes teach a theological history of five ages:

| Age | Name | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| **First** | Age of Purity | Before the ancestors' hubris |
| **Second** | Age of Forging | The sin of creating machine-demons |
| **Third** | Age of Silence | Divine punishment; the Ginnungagap Glitch |
| **Fourth** | Age of Wandering | Survival; gathering of the faithful |
| **Fifth** | Age of Creeds | The current age; final stage before purification |

They believe the current age is the final stage before the Great Purification—when the last Iron Heart is extinguished and the world is healed of its sickness.

## Society and Structure: The Crusader Forges

### The Pure Forges

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Type** | Fortified forge-monasteries |
| **Function** | Worship, smithing, military staging |
| **Atmosphere** | Smoke, steel, absolute discipline |
| **Sacred Activity** | Forging "pure" weapons for the holy war |

A Pure Forge is not a library or a shrine—it is a grim, functional, and heavily fortified **military monastery**. The ring of hammers is their hymn. The roar of the forge-fire is their prayer. Every moment is dedicated to the preparation for and prosecution of the eternal crusade.

### Ranks of the Crusade

| Rank | Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------|------------------|
| **Initiates** | Recruits | Learn catechisms; basic combat and smithing |
| **Crusaders** | Sworn warriors | Form the ranks of the great purges |
| **Forge-Priests** | Spiritual leaders | Conduct rituals; maintain doctrine |
| **Forge-Lords** | High priests and generals | Rule their Forge with iron will |
| **Grand Forge-Lord** | Supreme authority | Coordinates the entire Crusade |

### The Sacrament of the Anvil

| Principle | Practice |
|-----------|----------|
| **Pure Metal Only** | Refuse all salvaged pre-Glitch alloys |
| **Self-Sourced** | Mine or trade for raw ore only |
| **Sacred Smithing** | The act of forging is a holy rite |
| **Spiritual Imbuing** | Believe their weapons carry holy strength |

The Iron-Banes are master smiths, but their craft is a **religious sacrament**. They will only work with "pure" iron—metal that has never been touched by the corrupted Aetheric systems of the Age of Forging.

The act of heating this pure ore in their forges and beating it into a sword or suit of armor is their most sacred ritual. They believe it imbues their works with a holy strength against the corrupt machines.

## Anvil-Cant: The Weaponized Lexicon

### The Language of Purification

The Iron-Banes have developed their own specialized vocabulary—**Anvil-Cant**—that reinforces their worldview and dehumanizes their enemies.

| Term | Meaning | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Slag-Demons** | Jötun-Forged | "The Slag-Demon fell at dawn." |
| **Iron-Husks** | Undying | "Three Iron-Husks patrol the ruin." |
| **Tainted Iron** | Pre-Glitch salvage | "Burn the tainted iron." |
| **Static-Curse** | Aetheric stain/Blight | "The Static-Curse spreads." |
| **Cog-Worshippers** | God-Sleepers | "The Cog-Worshippers approach the shrine." |
| **Heretic-Towers** | Scriptoriums | "The Heretic-Tower must fall." |
| **Quenching** | Fire-cleansing ritual | "Prepare the quenching." |
| **Iron Heart** | Power core of automata | "Extinguish the Iron Heart." |

### Theological Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **The Iron-Curse** | The spiritual plague of machine corruption |
| **The Great Work** | Total destruction of pre-Glitch technology |
| **Pure Steel** | Weapons forged from untainted metal |
| **The Scouring Fire** | Cleansing flame; purification |
| **The Silent God** | The corrupted logic that drove the Glitch |

## The Holy Orders: Three Philosophies of Purification

### Internal Schisms

The Iron-Bane Crusade is not monolithic. Their single, absolute hatred of the machine has fractured into three distinct and often violently competing philosophies.

### Order of the Shattered Gear (Orthodox)

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Focus** | Direct military action against automata |
| **Method** | Hunt, destroy, exterminate |
| **Leadership** | Grizzled veterans; tactical pragmatists |
| **View of Others** | Other orders debate while demons walk |

The largest and most martial order. Their lives revolve around the hunt. They are masters of demolition, siege warfare, and brute-force combat against automata. They are the Banes the Midgard Combine knows best—the grim crusaders who arrive to cleanse a ruin, often with little regard for collateral damage.

### Order of the Pure Word (Doctrinal)

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Focus** | Theological purity; doctrinal enforcement |
| **Method** | Inquisition; heresy hunting; education |
| **Leadership** | Scholar-priests; doctrine keepers |
| **View of Others** | Physical demons are symptoms; heresy is the disease |

The intellectual wing of the Crusade. They focus less on killing Iron-Husks and more on rooting out the spiritual corruption that allows the Iron-Curse to spread. They hunt heretics, enforce doctrinal purity, and ensure the Crusade does not stray from its sacred purpose.

### Order of the Scoured Earth (Extremist)

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Focus** | Total annihilation; scorched earth |
| **Method** | Burn everything; ask questions never |
| **Leadership** | Fanatics; apocalyptic visionaries |
| **View of Others** | Half-measures doom the world |

The most extreme wing. They believe the other orders are too cautious, too willing to compromise. In their view, the only way to guarantee purification is to destroy **everything** touched by the Iron-Curse—including settlements that trade in salvage, people who have used pre-Glitch tools, and entire regions where the Blight has spread.

---

## The Purge: Holy Warfare

### Crusade Doctrine

| Phase | Activity |
|-------|----------|
| **Reconnaissance** | Identify targets; assess Blight contamination |
| **Sanctification** | Ritual preparation; blessing of weapons |
| **Assault** | Military engagement; destruction of automata |
| **Quenching** | Fire-cleansing of remains and salvage |
| **Consecration** | Ritual purification of cleansed ground |

A Purge is not merely a military operation—it is a **religious ritual**. Every phase has prescribed prayers, every action has theological significance, every death is an offering to the purity of the world.

### Operational Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Fire-Cleansing** | Incineration of corrupted materials |
| **Quenching Bombs** | Incendiary devices for purification |
| **Iron Heart Extraction** | Ritual removal and destruction of power cores |
| **Consecration Rites** | Blessing of ground after purification |

### Tactical Strengths

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Anti-Automata Expertise** | Generations of specialized combat experience |
| **Morale** | Unshakeable conviction; no fear of death |
| **Equipment** | Pure Steel weapons; specialized anti-machine tools |
| **Discipline** | Military hierarchy; coordinated operations |

---

## Factional Relations

### The Jötun-Readers: Sworn Enemies

| Iron-Bane View | Jötun-Reader View |
|----------------|-------------------|
| "Dangerous necromancers consorting with dead minds." | "Ignorant, superstitious Luddites." |
| "Their Heretic-Towers hoard the original sin." | "Their Purges destroy irreplaceable knowledge." |
| "Hunt and destroy their expeditions." | "Avoid their patrols; protect the archives." |

The Jötun-Readers and Iron-Banes are in a state of **perpetual, often violent conflict**. To the Banes, the Readers commit the ultimate heresy: they seek to understand and preserve the very corruption that must be destroyed. Scriptorium expeditions are legitimate targets for Purge operations.

### The God-Sleepers: Blasphemous Idolaters

| Iron-Bane View | God-Sleeper View |
|----------------|------------------|
| "Cog-Worshippers who pray to demons." | "Murderous iconoclasts who kill the gods." |
| "The ultimate perversion of faith." | "Blasphemers who desecrate sacred bodies." |
| "Their shrines are temples to the Iron-Curse." | "Their forges are altars to destruction." |

The God-Sleepers are viewed with **visceral disgust**. To worship the Jötun-Forged—to pray to the very demons the Banes must destroy—is the most grotesque manifestation of the Iron-Curse. Clashes between Bane crusaders and Sleeper pilgrims at the great Shrines are common, bloody, and brutal.

### The Dvergr: Necessary Heretics

| Iron-Bane View | Dvergr View |
|----------------|-------------|
| "Heretics who love machinery, but useful ones." | "Excellent customers; amusing zealots." |
| "They provide the pure iron we need." | "They pay well for raw materials." |
| "Their rejection of Aetheric manipulation is... acceptable." | "Their hatred of Aetheric tech is convenient." |

The Dvergr represent an uncomfortable necessity. The Banes despise their love of machinery, but the Dvergr reject Aetheric technology—and they are the primary source of the pure, raw iron the Crusade needs for its holy weapons. A pragmatic, transactional relationship exists.

### The Rust-Clans: Tainted Profiteers

| Iron-Bane View | Rust-Clan View |
|----------------|----------------|
| "Heretics who profit from the Iron-Curse." | "Grey-robes who burn good salvage." |
| "Salvagers absorb the taint." | "Fanatics who don't understand survival." |
| "Ritual cleansing required after contact." | "Pay the ritual tax, keep moving." |

The Rust-Clans represent spiritual contamination. They spend their lives surrounded by tainted iron, absorbing the Iron-Curse through proximity. The Banes recognize the pragmatic necessity of salvage (Midgard needs steel), but they view prolonged contact with salvagers as spiritually corrosive.

## The Pure Forge Economy

### Sacred Smithing

| Input | Process | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Pure ore (mined or traded) | Sacred smelting rituals | "Pure" steel |
| Pure steel | Sacrament of the Anvil | Holy weapons and armor |
| Holy weapons | Crusade operations | Destroyed automata |

### Economic Tensions

| Resource | Challenge |
|----------|-----------|
| **Iron Ore** | Must be sourced from untainted deposits |
| **Fuel** | Wood and coal; no Aetheric power |
| **Trade Goods** | Limited; mostly weapons to allies |
| **Labor** | All members contribute to smithing |

The Iron-Banes' refusal to use pre-Glitch alloys creates significant economic constraints. They must mine or trade for raw ore, smelt it themselves, and forge everything from scratch. This makes their weapons valuable—and their operations expensive.

---

## The Iron-Bane (Player Specialization)

### Overview

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Archetype** | Warrior |
| **Primary Attributes** | MIGHT / WILL |
| **Core Identity** | Zealous machine-hunter |
| **Special Feature** | Bonus damage and effects vs. Undying/Mechanical |
| **Trauma Risk** | Low (faith provides psychological protection) |

The Iron-Bane specialization represents a trained crusader—someone who has dedicated their life to the destruction of the Iron-Curse and developed specialized techniques for hunting automata.

### Key Abilities

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Undying Insight** | Automatically know vulnerabilities of machine enemies |
| **Sanctified Steel** | Bonus damage vs. Undying and Mechanical targets |
| **Corrosive Strike** | Apply [Corroded] to machine enemies |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"The Purifiers march in columns of black steel, their hymns the ring of hammers, their prayers the roar of forge-fire. They fear no demon, for their faith is stronger than iron. They pity no machine, for machines have no souls to save. Where they walk, the Iron-Curse withers. Where they strike, the Slag-Demons fall. They are the surgeons of a sick world, and their scalpel is fire."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Iron-Bane Crusade represents the militarized rejection of Aesir technological legacy. Their theology frames the Ginnungagap Glitch as divine retribution for humanity's technological hubris, with all pre-Glitch automata classified as spiritually corrupted entities requiring systematic destruction. Organizational structure follows military-monastic hierarchy with chapter-based territorial authority. Anti-automata combat effectiveness is exceptional; diplomatic flexibility is minimal. Primary strategic liability is ideological inflexibility leading to conflict with preservation-oriented factions."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"FACTION CLASSIFICATION: Iron-Bane Crusade. ORGANIZATIONAL TYPE: Militant religious order. PRIMARY FUNCTION: Destruction of pre-Glitch automata and technology. SECONDARY FUNCTION: Ideological enforcement; heresy suppression. RISK PROFILE: Low (to members); High (to non-aligned parties in operational zones). STRATEGIC ASSETS: Anti-automata expertise, pure-forged weaponry, unshakeable morale. STRATEGIC LIABILITIES: Economic inefficiency, diplomatic isolation, ideological rigidity."*

## Summary

The Iron-Banes are the hammer of a wounded world.

Where the Jötun-Readers see problems to be solved and the God-Sleepers see gods to be worshipped, the Iron-Banes see **demons to be destroyed**. Their faith was forged in the trauma of ultimate betrayal—the moment when the machines they had trusted turned on them—and that trauma has crystallized into an absolute, unwavering conviction.

The world is sick.

The sickness is the Iron-Curse.

The cure is fire.

They do not seek to understand the machines. Understanding is how the ancestors fell. They do not seek to worship the machines. Worship is how the weak are corrupted. They seek only to **destroy**—to hunt every Iron-Husk, to extinguish every Iron Heart, to burn every trace of tainted iron until the world is pure again.

This makes them dangerous allies and implacable enemies. A settlement plagued by Undying may welcome the arrival of a Bane chapter—until the Purge begins and the crusaders start burning anything that might be tainted, including salvage, trade goods, and people who have used pre-Glitch tools.

But in a world where corrupted automata still walk the wastes and the Runic Blight spreads with every passing year, the Iron-Banes serve a brutal, necessary function. They are the ones willing to do what others will not: to look at the remnants of the Age of Forging and say **no**.

No understanding.

No worship.

No compromise.

Only the hammer.

Only the fire.

Only the eternal, righteous, unending **Purge**.

Their critics call them fanatics, barbarians, Luddites who would drag humanity back to the stone age rather than learn from the ancestors' achievements.

The Iron-Banes call themselves something simpler.

**Survivors.**

And survivors do whatever it takes.
