## Core Identity

**Radical Self-Reliance II** makes stealth and climbing **second nature**. Your body moves with practiced efficiency—someone who's spent years where **a single misstep means death**.

---

## Mechanics

### Always Active

- **+1d10** to Acrobatics (Stealth)
- **+1d10** to Acrobatics (Climbing)
- Stacks with Acrobatics +1 skill

### Rank Progression

| Rank | PP Cost | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 4 | +1d10 to Stealth and Climbing |
| 2 | 20 | +2d10 to each |
| 3 | 35 | +3d10 to each + **perfect silence** (no noise on any surface) |

---

## Tactical Applications

**Silent Passage (Rank 2):**

```
Base: FINESSE 3 = 3d10
Acrobatics +1: +1d10
RSR II (Rank 2): +2d10
Total: 6d10 → DC 16 achievable
```

**Ghost Mode (Rank 3):**

- **Perfect Silence:** No noise regardless of surface
- Glass doesn't crunch, metal doesn't clang, water doesn't splash
- Completely undetectable by audio

**Synergies:**

- **Infiltration:** Scout dangerous areas solo
- **Trap avoidance:** Stealth past threats
- **Climbing:** Access unreachable areas

## Failure Modes

<aside>
⚠️

**Critical Failures** — Even 6d10 pools can roll zero successes. Never solo scout without backup escape plan.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Visual Detection** — Perfect silence (Rank 3) eliminates audio but doesn't grant invisibility. Guards can still see you.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Exhaustion Penalties** — [Exhausted] status applies -2d10 to all physical checks including climbing. Rest before major climbs.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Solo Overreach** — Deep infiltration creates isolation. Never scout beyond party rescue range (30-60 feet max).
