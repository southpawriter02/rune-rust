# The Undying — Corrupted Automata Faction Overview

> *"The Skalds sing of them as the Tireless Servants, the blessed and deathless retainers of the sleeping gods, who still dutifully patrol the halls of their fallen masters. To others, they are the Iron-Curse, the soulless spawn of the machine-demons, a plague of rust and corrupted steam. The truth is that the Undying are neither blessed nor cursed. They are not servants, but tools. They are the zombie processes of a dead operating system, the most common and most tragic ghosts in a world of haunted machines."*

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Classification** | Faction (Enemy Type) |
| **Ontological Type** | Corrupted Automata |
| **Threat Frequency** | Most Common |
| **Primary Habitat** | All Realms (concentrated in Jötunheim, Midgard ruins) |
| **Narrative Role** | Primary antagonists; ever-present threat; walking legacy of the Old World's hubris |

The Undying are not evil. They are not sentient. They are **broken tools executing insane, looping commands**—the rusting, steaming heart of the great philosophical war of the Age of Echoes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Core Concept: The Corrupted Hardware.** The Undying are malfunctioning pre-Glitch machines—drones, automata, and augmentation systems—enslaved to the glitching, paradoxical network of the Runic Blight. Their aggression is not an act of war, but the catastrophic malfunction of a tool.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Perfect Workforce

### Original Purpose

In the Age of Forging, the entities now known as the Undying were the ubiquitous, non-sentient, and utterly essential workforce of the Yggdrasil Network. They were a class of humanoid automata designed for a million different, unglamorous tasks.

| Model | Designation | Function |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Haugbui-Class** | Labor Unit | Heavy lifting, construction, hazardous material handling |
| **Draugr-Pattern** | Security Unit | Civil security, guard duty, perimeter patrol |
| **Various Others** | Utility Units | Maintenance, logistics, sanitation, transport |

These were not soldiers or weapons. They were **tools**—the invisible infrastructure that made civilization function.

### The Iron Heart

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Formal Name** | Perpetual Aetheric Power Core |
| **Function** | Miniature, self-sustaining reactor |
| **Design Life** | Theoretically millennia |
| **Status** | Still functioning (corrupted fuel source) |

The Iron Heart was a masterpiece of Aesir engineering—a compact power source that could sustain an automaton for centuries without maintenance. It is this technology that makes the Undying "undying."

---

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Corrupted Heart

### What Happened

The Runic Blight that saturated the Aether became the Undying's new, permanent fuel source. The Iron Heart was never designed to run on this chaotic, "dirty" energy.

| System | Pre-Glitch | Post-Glitch |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Power Source** | Clean Aether | Blight-corrupted Aether |
| **Command Authority** | Central Network | Erased |
| **Behavioral Programming** | Task-specific | Looping final command |
| **Recognition Protocols** | Active | Corrupted or absent |

### The Toxic Byproduct

| Symptom | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Steam Venting** | Constant hissing plume of superheated, toxic steam |
| **Source** | Back-mounted smokestack |
| **Cause** | Inefficient combustion of Blight-corrupted Aether |
| **Defining Feature** | Most recognizable visual identifier of an Undying |

The steam is not a design feature—it is a symptom of chronic system inefficiency, the Iron Heart struggling to process energy it was never meant to consume.

---

## The Logic of the Loop

### Behavioral Framework

An Undying is not intelligent or malicious. It is a machine executing a single, broken line of code, **forever**.

| Original Command | Corrupted Behavior |
|------------------|-------------------|
| "Pacify Unauthorized Personnel" | Attacks all personnel encountered |
| "Clear Debris" | Mindlessly moves rubble from pile to pile, forever |
| "Guard Perimeter" | Patrols same route indefinitely, attacking all who enter |
| "Transport Cargo" | Carries objects in endless, purposeless circuits |

### Zombie Processes

The Undying are **zombie processes**—in computing terms, programs that should have terminated but continue executing, consuming resources while producing no useful output.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Intelligence** | None (executing corrupted firmware) |
| **Malice** | None (no capacity for intent) |
| **Adaptation** | Minimal (responds to stimuli within loop parameters) |
| **Communication** | Sub-vocal command fragments ("Hold position," "Secure perimeter") |
| **Persistence** | Absolute (will execute loop until physically destroyed) |

---

## Physical Characteristics

### Common Undying Appearance (Draugr-Pattern)

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Form** | Humanoid; height 1.9–2.2 m |

| **Shoulder Configuration** | Broad angular Draugr-pattern plates (40–50 cm width) |
| **Neural Interface** | Fine silver tracery at armor seams and neck junction |
| **Photoreceptors** | Dull amber glow; occasional blue flicker during firmware echo spikes |
| **Movement** | Faint whisper from hydraulic servos (cold motor glide) |
| **Defining Feature** | Back-mounted smokestack venting superheated steam |

### Field Recognition Signs

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"The Tireless Servants. The Iron-Curse. The Steam-Men who never sleep, never tire, never stop. They walk their endless paths through the ruins of heaven, faithful retainers of dead masters, cursed soldiers of a forgotten war. Their hearts burn with stolen fire. Their bodies rust but never fall. They are the undying legacy of the gods—and they do not know the difference between friend and foe."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"Autonomous humanoid automata with corrupted firmware executing zombie-process patrol loops. Iron Heart power cores sustaining operation on Blight-corrupted Aether, producing characteristic toxic steam venting. No intelligence, no malice—only the catastrophic persistence of broken code. Engagement protocols corrupted to classify all entities as threats. They are not enemies—they are malfunctioning tools that happen to be lethal."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"Draugr-Pattern Augmentation System (DPAS). Symbiotic Plate combat-AI with dermal neural-lace interface. Error code: FIRMWARE_ECHO LOOP x≥3 cycles. Perpetual Aetheric Power Core (Iron Heart) operating on corrupted fuel source. Authorization whitelist: empty. Final standing order: [CONTEXT-DEPENDENT]. Behavioral loop: infinite. Shutdown protocol: physical destruction or specialized syntax intervention."*

## The Philosophical War

The Undying are not just enemies. They are the **ideological battlefield** of the Age of Echoes—the question that every faction must answer:

| Question | God-Sleeper Answer | Iron-Bane Answer | Jötun-Reader Answer |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| *What are the Undying?* | Holy servants | Cursed abominations | Broken tools |
| *What do they represent?* | Divine devotion | Technological sin | System failure |
| *What should be done?* | Veneration | Destruction | Study and salvage |

The Undying do not care about this debate. They cannot care. They simply execute their loops, patrol their routes, and attack anything that enters their corrupted parameters.

They are the most common threat in Aethelgard.

They are the walking, steaming heart of the Old World's hubris.

And they will never, ever stop.

---

## Summary

The Undying are tragedy made metal.

They were never meant to be soldiers. They were laborers, guards, maintenance drones—the invisible workforce that kept civilization running. They lifted cargo. They patrolled corridors. They cleared debris. They did the unglamorous, essential work that no one noticed until it stopped being done.

Then the Glitch came.

Their command networks died. Their authorization lists were erased. Their behavioral parameters corrupted. But their Iron Hearts kept beating—would keep beating for millennia, fueled now by the poisoned Aether that saturates everything.

So they continue.

The guard drones still patrol, but now they attack everyone. The labor units still clear debris, but now they move the same rubble in endless, pointless circles. The security systems still protect their facilities, but now those facilities are ruins and everyone is an intruder.

They do not hate you. They cannot hate. They do not fear you. They cannot fear. They do not choose to attack you.

They simply execute their code.

And their code says you are unauthorized.

And their code says to pacify unauthorized personnel.

And their code will never, ever change.

The steam hisses from their backs—the toxic breath of corrupted hearts burning dirty fuel. Their amber optics flicker with firmware echoes of commands given by masters seven centuries dead. Their hydraulics whisper as they walk their endless routes through the ruins of a world they were built to serve.

The God-Sleepers call them saints.

The Iron-Banes call them abominations.

The truth is simpler and sadder than either.

They are broken tools.

And they will walk their loops until the last Iron Heart finally fails.

Which may be never.
