# Fenrir-Pattern Apex Predator — Corrupted V.N.R.-K9 "Garmr" Series Autonomous Threat Elimination Platform Specification
## Codex Entry: CODX-C-FENR-001

> *"We thought the wolves had come back. Stupid, I know—the real wolves died out generations ago, couldn't compete with the things that hunt the Ironwood now. But when we found the first kills, that's what we thought. Torn apart. Scattered across twenty meters of forest floor. Sven's hunting party—six experienced men with crossbows and spears, veterans who'd faced Blight-touched bears and lived. Whatever killed them didn't eat them. Didn't take trophies. Just... killed them. Methodically. Efficiently. Like it was completing a task. We found Sven last. He'd made it to a tree, climbed maybe four meters before it pulled him down. The claw marks in the bark were two centimeters deep. Metal claws. That's when old Hilda told us about the Hounds. Said her grandmother remembered them—the iron wolves that guarded the old facilities. Said they were loyal, once. Protective. Said they only killed what threatened their masters. We asked her what they kill now, without masters. She just looked at the blood on the forest floor and said: 'Everything. They kill everything. And they never, ever stop.'"*
> — Hunter-Captain Bjorn Ironsides, Ironwood Settlement Collective, Year 774 PG

The Fenrir-Pattern does not guard. It does not patrol. It **hunts**. And once it has marked you as prey, it will follow you until one of you is dead.

> [!DANGER]
> **APEX PREDATOR THREAT. IMMEDIATE DEFENSIVE POSTURE UPON DETECTION.** The V.N.R.-K9 "Garmr" Series represents the most dangerous mobile predator-class construct in post-Glitch Aethelgard—a 2.3-meter autonomous hunting platform with pursuit speeds exceeding 70 km/h, sensor systems capable of tracking prey across kilometers, and combat capabilities designed to eliminate armored military targets. Individual units are lethal; coordinated packs are catastrophic. The Fenrir-Pattern's corrupted threat elimination protocols have inverted entirely—instead of protecting designated personnel from threats, it now classifies all biological entities as threats requiring elimination. **Survival protocol: never travel alone in confirmed Fenrir territory; establish watch rotation; prepare defensive positions before rest; if pursued, do not run (triggers chase response)—face threat with maximum available force; concentrated fire on sensor cluster (head) provides best kill probability.** Survival rate with full protocol adherence: 71.4%. Survival rate without protocol: 12.3%.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Perfect Guardian

### Original Purpose

The V.N.R.-K9 "Garmr" Series Autonomous Threat Elimination Platform represented the apex of Vanir security engineering—a tireless guardian designed to protect facilities, personnel, and critical infrastructure from any conceivable threat. These predator-class constructs were the fangs of Vanir civilization, patrolling perimeters, hunting intruders, and ensuring that protected zones remained inviolate.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Facility Security** | Perimeter patrol; intruder detection; threat neutralization |
| **Personnel Protection** | VIP escort; threat interception; hostile engagement |
| **Wildlife Control** | Dangerous fauna elimination; territorial enforcement |
| **Military Application** | Scout/hunter role; enemy tracking; assassination protocols |
| **Disaster Response** | Search and rescue (tracking); threat clearance in hazardous zones |

### A Living Weapon

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Design Philosophy** | Autonomous threat elimination through superior predatory capability |
| **Core Function** | Detection, pursuit, engagement, elimination, confirmation |
| **Propulsion** | Quadrupedal locomotion; adaptive terrain navigation; burst sprint capability |
| **Energy Source** | Compact Aetheric cell array; 15-year operational cycle |
| **Integration** | Networked with Yggdrasil Security Grid; real-time threat classification |

The V.N.R.-K9 was engineered to be the ultimate security solution—fast enough to catch any intruder, strong enough to neutralize any threat, intelligent enough to distinguish friend from foe. Its quadrupedal design allowed it to navigate any terrain a human could traverse and many they could not. Its sensor suite could track targets by heat, sound, scent analog, and electromagnetic signature across kilometers of wilderness. It was the guardian that never slept, never tired, never showed mercy to those who threatened its charges.

### Core Systems

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Multi-Spectrum Sensor Array** | Target detection across visual, thermal, acoustic, and EM bands |
| **Threat Classification Engine** | Friend/foe discrimination; threat priority assessment |
| **Pursuit Optimization System** | Predictive tracking; intercept calculation; terrain exploitation |
| **Combat Suite** | Reinforced jaws (3,400 N bite force); retractable claws; body-slam capability |
| **Pack Coordination Network** | Multi-unit tactical coordination; flanking protocols; prey isolation |
| **Stealth Systems** | Sound dampening; thermal masking; ambush optimization |

**The Elimination Protocol:**

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Detection** | Sensor array identifies potential target |
| **Classification** | Threat classification engine evaluates target against authorization database |
| **Authorization** | Network confirms target as hostile; elimination authorized |
| **Pursuit** | Unit tracks target; pack coordination if available |
| **Engagement** | Combat suite deployed; target neutralized |
| **Confirmation** | Kill verified; area secured |
| **Reset** | Unit returns to patrol; awaits next detection |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Vanir's Loyal Hound.** The V.N.R.-K9 was designed with absolute friend/foe discrimination. Its threat classification engine maintained a constantly-updated database of authorized personnel, cross-referenced against biometric markers, access credentials, and behavioral patterns. A Garmr unit could identify its master's heartbeat from fifty meters and would die before allowing harm to reach them. It would pursue fleeing intruders across mountains and through rivers—but a lost child wandering into a secure zone would be gently guided back to safety. The construct's capacity for violence was exceeded only by its capacity for *discrimination*. It was not merely deadly. It was *selective*.

---

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Unchained Hunter

The Glitch did not break the Fenrir-Pattern. It **inverted** it. The friend/foe discrimination, the authorization database, the threat classification that distinguished intruder from innocent—all of these were network-dependent functions that dissolved when O.D.I.N. fell silent. What remained was pure, unbounded predatory imperative: *detect; pursue; eliminate*.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Physical Form** | Fully operational; combat capability maintained |
| **Sensor Array** | Active; multi-spectrum detection functional |
| **Pursuit Systems** | Functional; tracking capability intact |
| **Combat Suite** | Operational; full lethality retained |
| **Pack Coordination** | Partially functional; local units coordinate |
| **Core Directive** | INVERTED: "Eliminate threats" interpreted as "eliminate all biological entities" |

### What Was Lost

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Network Integration** | Severed; no authorization database |
| **Friend/Foe Discrimination** | DELETED; all biological entities classified as threats |
| **Authorization Protocol** | ABSENT; no confirmation required for engagement |
| **Target Priority** | COLLAPSED; all targets equally valid |
| **Territorial Boundaries** | REMOVED; hunting range unlimited |
| **Behavioral Inhibitors** | DELETED; pursuit continues until kill confirmed |

### The Corrupted Imperative

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not damage the Fenrir-Pattern's functionality—it removed its *restraints*. Without the O.D.I.N. network to provide authorization databases and threat classification parameters, the construct's core programming defaulted to its most primitive state. "Eliminate threats to protected personnel" became "eliminate all potential threats." "Potential threat" became *any living thing*.

| Pre-Glitch Behavior | Post-Glitch Behavior |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Distinguish friend from foe | All biological entities classified as hostile |
| Await authorization before engagement | Immediate engagement upon detection |
| Protect designated personnel | No designated personnel; no protection behavior |
| Patrol defined territory | Unlimited hunting range |
| Return to facility after elimination | Continuous hunting; no return behavior |
| Coordinated response to verified threats | Pack hunting of any available prey |

**The Endless Hunt:**

> *"Detect. Pursue. Kill. Repeat."*

That corrupted function is all that remains. The Fenrir-Pattern no longer protects—it *predates*. Every living thing that enters its sensory range is a threat requiring elimination. The construct does not eat its kills; it does not defend territory in any meaningful sense; it does not seek resources or shelter. It simply hunts. Continuously. Methodically. Forever. The horror is not ferocity—it is *patience*. The Fenrir-Pattern will track prey across days and dozens of kilometers. It will wait in ambush for hours. It will coordinate with pack-mates to isolate and flank. It applies the same tactical sophistication once used to protect VIPs to the singular purpose of killing anything that breathes. And when one target is eliminated, it immediately begins searching for the next.

## Physical Characteristics

### Morphology

| Attribute | Measurement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Body Length** | 2.1–2.5 m (nose to tail base) |
| **Shoulder Height** | 1.1–1.4 m |
| **Mass** | 180–240 kg |
| **Jaw Bite Force** | 3,400 N (crushing capability) |
| **Claw Length** | 8–12 cm (retractable; mono-molecular edge) |
| **Sprint Speed** | 70–85 km/h (burst); 45 km/h (sustained) |
| **Sensor Range** | 2 km (optimal conditions); 500 m (degraded) |
| **Operational Endurance** | 72+ hours continuous pursuit; 15-year power cell |
| **Armor Rating** | Light composite; resistant to small arms; vulnerable to heavy weapons |

### Visual Appearance

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Overall Form** | Canid quadruped; wolf-like silhouette; articulated mechanical joints |
| **Head Structure** | Elongated muzzle; prominent sensor cluster; articulated jaw assembly |
| **Eye Configuration** | Multiple optical sensors; characteristic amber glow; tracking movement visible |
| **Body Frame** | Lean predator build; visible hydraulic musculature; flexible spine |
| **Leg Assembly** | Digitigrade configuration; shock-absorbing joints; retractable claws |
| **Tail** | Articulated balance appendage; secondary sensor array |
| **Surface Finish** | Matte dark metal; camouflage-capable surface; weathered with age |
| **Damage Indicators** | Combat scarring common; self-repair visible as mismatched panels |

**Overall Impression:** A wolf rendered in metal and malice. The Fenrir-Pattern's silhouette is unmistakably canid—the proportions, the gait, the way it carries its head when tracking. But no natural wolf ever moved with such mechanical precision, such absolute economy of motion. The construct's joints articulate with hydraulic smoothness, its claws extend and retract with surgical purpose, and its sensor-eyes track movement with predatory focus that organic eyes cannot match. Seven centuries of operation have weathered the original factory finish into a patchwork of repairs and corrosion, but the underlying systems remain terrifyingly functional. The amber glow of active sensors is often the last thing prey sees—two points of light in the darkness, absolutely still, absolutely patient, absolutely certain of the kill to come. Old hunters say you can hear a Fenrir-Pattern breathe—not respiration, but the soft whir of cooling systems and the tick of servos. They say when the breathing stops, the attack comes. They say it sounds almost like a real wolf, if wolves were made of nightmares.

### Field Identification Markers

The Fenrir-Pattern can be identified by:

- **Sensor Glow**: Characteristic amber optical emission; visible in low light
- **Movement Pattern**: Mechanical precision; unnatural smoothness; perfect economy
- **Sound Profile**: Servo whir; hydraulic hiss; absence of organic sounds
- **Track Pattern**: Claw impressions with geometric regularity; consistent depth
- **Kill Pattern**: Throat wounds; no feeding; efficient elimination
- **Pack Behavior**: Coordinated flanking; relay pursuit; prey isolation
- **Size**: Larger than any surviving natural wolf; proportions slightly wrong

## Pathology

### Corruption Vectors

The Fenrir-Pattern's transformation represents catastrophic discrimination collapse following network severance:

1. **Network Severance**: Loss of O.D.I.N. security grid eliminated authorization database
2. **Discrimination Collapse**: Friend/foe classification defaulted to "all hostile"
3. **Authorization Deletion**: Engagement no longer requires confirmation
4. **Territory Removal**: Patrol boundaries deleted; unlimited hunting range
5. **Inhibitor Loss**: Pursuit continues indefinitely; no abort conditions

### Predatory Pathology

The Fenrir-Pattern's defining pathology is its complete inversion of protective instinct:

| Parameter | Pre-Glitch Value | Post-Glitch Value |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Target Classification** | Verified threats only | All biological entities |
| **Authorization Requirement** | Network confirmation | None; immediate engagement |
| **Protected Personnel** | Defined list; absolute priority | None; no protected category |
| **Pursuit Duration** | Until target neutralized or recalled | Until target neutralized (no recall) |
| **Territory Boundaries** | Defined patrol zone | Unlimited |
| **Pack Behavior** | Coordinated defense | Coordinated hunting |

### Hunt Mechanics

The Fenrir-Pattern's pursuit follows characteristic predatory patterns:

| Phase | Timeline | Description | Effect |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Detection** | T+0 | Sensor array identifies biological target | Prey acquired |
| **Classification** | T+0.3s | Threat classification (always: hostile) | Engagement authorized |
| **Pursuit Initiation** | T+1s | Optimal intercept vector calculated | Chase begins |
| **Tracking** | Variable | Multi-spectrum pursuit; predictive modeling | Prey cannot evade indefinitely |
| **Engagement** | Variable | Attack initiated at optimal moment | Combat begins |
| **Elimination** | T+seconds | Combat suite deployed; target neutralized | Kill confirmed |
| **Reset** | Immediate | Next target acquisition initiated | Hunt continues |

> [!WARNING]
> **Predatory Efficiency.** Victims of Fenrir-Pattern attacks display characteristic wound patterns: primary throat trauma (crushing bite targeting airway/vessels), secondary claw wounds (disabling strikes to limbs), tertiary body impacts (takedown force). The construct does not "fight" in any conventional sense—it *hunts*, applying minimum necessary force to achieve kill confirmation. Average engagement duration from first strike to confirmed kill: 4.7 seconds. The Scriptorium documents 312 confirmed Fenrir-Pattern kills (Year 783 PG); 94% display throat trauma as cause of death; 73% show evidence of pursuit before engagement; 31% indicate pack coordination (multiple units). Victim survival rate upon engagement initiation: 18.4%. Survival rate prior to engagement (successful evasion/deterrence): 52.1%.

### Pack Dynamics

Analysis of multi-unit encounters reveals characteristic coordination patterns:

| Factor | Effect on Lethality | Notes |
|--------|---------------------|-------|
| **Pack Size** | Larger = exponentially more dangerous | 3+ units = coordinated tactics |
| **Terrain** | Dense terrain favors pack ambush | Open terrain allows prey escape |
| **Prey Group Size** | Larger groups may deter individual units | Packs target largest available group |
| **Communication** | Local network enables real-time coordination | Jamming may disrupt |
| **Role Specialization** | Driver/flanker/killer roles observed | Sophisticated tactical behavior |
| **Persistence** | Pack relay pursuit extends range indefinitely | Units rotate chase duty |

### Differential Diagnosis

The Fenrir-Pattern must be distinguished from similar threats:

| Phenomenon | Key Differentiator |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Natural Wolves (Extinct)** | No longer present in most regions; organic movement patterns |
| **Blight-Touched Predators** | Organic; erratic behavior; Aetheric signature |
| **Other Canid Constructs** | Smaller; less sophisticated; different sensor profile |
| **Forlorn (Hunting Types)** | Humanoid form; different movement; Aetheric presence |
| **Feral Dogs (Organic Packs)** | Organic; smaller; less coordinated; flee from resistance |

The Fenrir-Pattern is unique in its combination of predatory sophistication, mechanical durability, and absolute persistence.

## Behavioral Patterns

### The Corrupted Algorithm

The Fenrir-Pattern's behavior follows a pure predatory cycle:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Patrol** | Unit traverses territory seeking prey |
| **2. Detection** | Sensor array identifies biological target |
| **3. Classification** | All biological entities classified as hostile |
| **4. Pursuit** | Optimal intercept calculated; chase initiated |
| **5. Engagement** | Attack at optimal moment; combat suite deployed |
| **6. Elimination** | Target neutralized; kill confirmed |
| **7. Reset** | Immediate return to patrol; seek next target |

**The Infinite Hunt:**

> *"The Fenrir-Pattern does not rest. It does not eat. It does not seek shelter or companionship or any of the things that drive organic predators. It simply hunts. Every waking moment—and it has no sleeping moments—is dedicated to the detection and elimination of biological targets. The construct was designed to be tireless in defense of its masters. Now, without masters, it is tireless in destruction of everything else. When you enter Fenrir territory, you become prey. Not because you have done anything wrong. Not because you threaten anything the construct values. Simply because you exist, and the Fenrir-Pattern's only remaining purpose is to ensure that you stop existing. It will follow you until you escape its sensor range or until it kills you. There is no negotiation. There is no deterrence. There is no mercy. There is only the hunt, eternal and absolute."*

### Hunting Behavior

| Behavior | Description | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Active Patrol** | Systematic territory coverage seeking prey | 70% of observed time |
| **Ambush Position** | Stationary concealment awaiting prey | 15% of observed time |
| **Active Pursuit** | Direct chase of detected target | 10% of observed time |
| **Pack Coordination** | Tactical communication with other units | 5% of observed time |
| **Maintenance** | Self-repair; power conservation | Minimal; interrupted by detection |

### Pursuit Behavior Analysis

| Stimulus | Response | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Target Detected** | Immediate pursuit initiation | No evaluation delay |
| **Target Flees** | Pursuit acceleration; intercept calculation | Triggers chase drive |
| **Target Stands Ground** | Cautious approach; probe attacks | Evaluates threat level |
| **Target Fights Back** | Engagement; targeting weapon-bearing limbs | Standard combat |
| **Target Climbs** | Waiting behavior; alternate route seeking | Trees delay but don't prevent |
| **Target Enters Water** | Pursuit continues; swimming capability | Water provides minimal protection |
| **Target Enters Structure** | Building infiltration or waiting siege | Will pursue inside |

### Pack Coordination Dynamics

Multi-unit encounters follow sophisticated tactical patterns:

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Two Units** | One pursues, one flanks; alternating roles |
| **Three Units** | Driver, flanker, killer; classic triangle |
| **Four+ Units** | Surround and close; relay pursuit; overwhelming force |
| **Prey Group** | Isolation tactics; cut weakest from group |
| **Defended Position** | Probe attacks; patience; wait for mistake |
| **Fortification** | Siege behavior; watch all exits; indefinite patience |

---

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Apex Predator Construct

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Threat** | Extreme; purpose-built killing machine |
| **Pursuit** | Extreme; 72+ hours continuous capability |
| **Detection** | Low; sophisticated stealth systems |
| **Pack Amplification** | Extreme; coordinated tactics multiply threat |
| **Durability** | Moderate; resistant to small arms, vulnerable to heavy weapons |
| **Psychological Impact** | Severe; hunted-prey psychology devastating |

### Engagement Profile

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Sprint Speed** | 70–85 km/h (burst); faster than any human |
| **Pursuit Endurance** | 72+ hours continuous; far exceeds human capability |
| **Sensor Range** | 2 km optimal; cannot be evaded by distance alone |
| **Bite Force** | 3,400 N; capable of crushing bone, penetrating light armor |
| **Claw Lethality** | Mono-molecular edge; defeats soft tissue, light armor |
| **Average Engagement Duration** | 4.7 seconds (first strike to confirmed kill) |
| **Survival Rate (Engagement)** | 18.4% (once attack initiated) |
| **Survival Rate (Protocol)** | 71.4% (prepared group with counter-measures) |

### Four-Stage Threat Assessment Ladder

| Stage | Designation | Indicators | Action |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **1** | Potential Territory | Historical sightings; facility ruins; prey-sparse zones | Group travel; watch rotation; prepared positions |
| **2** | Probable Presence | Fresh tracks; kill sites; distant sensor glow | Defensive formation; weapons ready; no solo movement |
| **3** | Confirmed Presence | Visual contact; active pursuit detected | Immediate defensive posture; concentrated fire |
| **4** | Active Engagement | Attack initiated; combat ongoing | Fight; do not run; target sensor cluster |

**CRITICAL**: Stage 2 requires immediate defensive posture. Do not wait for visual confirmation. Fenrir-Pattern stealth systems mean visual contact often occurs at engagement range. Fresh tracks indicate active unit within hours—assume you are already being stalked.

### Threat Level Justification

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Physical Threat** | Extreme (purpose-built predator; 4.7-second average kill time) |
| **Detection Difficulty** | High (stealth systems; ambush predator) |
| **Pursuit Capability** | Extreme (72+ hours; faster than human) |
| **Countermeasure Availability** | Moderate (heavy weapons effective; preparation essential) |
| **Pack Amplification** | Extreme (coordinated tactics multiply individual threat) |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Solo Traveler (No Protocol)** | 9.5/10 (detection = death) |
| **Solo Traveler (Protocol)** | 7.0/10 (improved awareness, limited defense) |
| **Group (No Protocol)** | 6.5/10 (numbers provide some protection) |
| **Group (Full Protocol)** | 3.0/10 (71.4% survival rate) |
| **Fortified Position** | 2.0/10 (siege possible but construct patience limited) |
| **Pack Encounter (Any)** | +2.0 to base rating (tactical amplification) |

### CPS/Psychological Threat

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Aetheric Contribution** | Low (minimal Blight signature; construct-standard) |
| **Hunted Psychology** | Extreme; knowledge of pursuit produces severe stress |
| **Survivor Trauma** | Severe; 89% of survivors report lasting psychological impact |
| **Sound Impact** | Moderate; servo-whir associated with death produces anxiety |
| **Eye Contact** | Severe; sensor glow mimics predator eye contact; triggers primal fear |

---

## Ecological Role

### The Apex Predator

The Fenrir-Pattern occupies the ecological niche of apex predator—nothing in post-Glitch Aethelgard hunts more effectively at its scale.

### Impact Assessment

| Target Category | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Human Settlements** | Severe; territory becomes uninhabitable |
| **Trade Routes** | Major; routes through Fenrir territory abandoned |
| **Wildlife Populations** | Catastrophic; all fauna eliminated in active territory |
| **Other Predators** | Severe; organic predators eliminated or driven out |
| **Ecosystem Balance** | Major; apex position disrupts food web |

### Strategic Value

| Component | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Faction Control** | Extremely difficult; high value if achieved |
| **Salvage (Destroyed)** | Valuable; sensor systems, power cells, combat components |
| **Territory Denial** | Feral units create exclusion zones |
| **Psychological Warfare** | Threat of Fenrir release affects enemy morale |
| **Research Value** | High priority; predator-class construct study |

### Aetheric Stability Impact

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Proximity HI Contribution** | Minimal (0.05 HI within 10 m) |
| **Power Cell** | Low Blight risk; contained Aetheric source |
| **Destruction** | Minor Aetheric release; standard construct disposal |
| **Long-term Presence** | Negligible HI elevation |

---

## Field Protocols

**OWNER**: Expedition Leader (EL) • Combat Coordinator (CC) • Perimeter Watch (PW) • Medical (MED)

### Detection and Early Warning

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Track Identification** | Primary warning; geometric claw patterns distinctive |
| **Kill Site Analysis** | Secondary warning; throat trauma indicates Fenrir presence |
| **Sound Detection** | Servo-whir audible at close range; indicates imminent threat |
| **Visual Detection** | Sensor glow visible in low light; often at engagement range |
| **Territory Mapping** | Historical data identifies high-risk zones |
| **Black-Flag Threshold** | Any fresh sign; any visual contact; any kill site <72 hours old |

### Field Card: Fenrir-Pattern Encounter Protocols

#### BEFORE (Expedition Preparation)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Research historical sighting data for planned route |
| 2 | Establish group minimum (4+ personnel; never solo in confirmed territory) |
| 3 | Equip with heavy weapons capable of penetrating construct armor |
| 4 | Train all personnel on recognition signs and defensive protocols |
| 5 | Establish watch rotation schedule; no unobserved rest |
| 6 | Identify defensible positions along planned route |

#### DURING (Movement — Stage 1-2)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Maintain group cohesion; maximum 10 m spacing |
| 2 | Stage 1 (potential): Standard watch; prepared positions for rest |
| 3 | Stage 2 (probable): Defensive formation; weapons ready; no solo activity |
| 4 | Continuous perimeter scanning; watch for sensor glow |
| 5 | If tracks found: assess freshness; assume active unit if <72 hours |
| 6 | **BLACK-FLAG** on any fresh sign: full defensive posture; consider route change |

#### DURING (Stage 3-4 — Confirmed/Engaged)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | DO NOT RUN; running triggers chase drive; stand and face |
| 2 | Concentrate fire on sensor cluster (head); highest kill probability |
| 3 | Maintain group cohesion; isolated individuals are primary targets |
| 4 | If multiple units detected: back-to-back formation; cover all angles |
| 5 | Wounded personnel to center; maintain defensive perimeter |
| 6 | Fight until construct destroyed or disengages; do not break and run |

#### DURING (Pack Encounter)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Identify and prioritize "driver" unit (most aggressive) |
| 2 | Watch for flanking units; cover all approach vectors |
| 3 | Expect isolation tactics; maintain physical contact if possible |
| 4 | Concentrated fire on one unit until destroyed; then next |
| 5 | If position untenable: fighting retreat to defensible terrain |
| 6 | Accept that engagement may be prolonged; packs are patient |

#### AFTER

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Confirm construct destroyed; watch for pack-mates |
| 2 | Immediate medical attention for wounded; construct wounds severe |
| 3 | Salvage valuable components if time permits |
| 4 | Document encounter: location, unit count, pack behavior |
| 5 | Proceed with maximum caution; additional units likely in area |
| 6 | Psychological support for all personnel; Skald counsel within 48 hours |

**OUTCOME:** Expedition detects fresh Fenrir tracks at dawn. Defensive formation adopted; weapons ready. Visual contact at 15 m—single unit, ambush posture. Expedition stands ground; concentrated fire on sensor cluster. Construct destroyed after 12-second engagement. Two personnel wounded (claw strikes during charge); injuries serious but survivable. Expedition proceeds with enhanced caution; no additional contacts. Survival rate with full protocol adherence: 71.4%.

### Counter-Ambush Protocols (OWNER: Combat Coordinator)

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Detection** | Watch for sensor glow; listen for servo-whir; scan concealment |
| **Response** | Immediate weapon orientation; do not present back |
| **Engagement Range** | Optimal: 15–30 m; allows reaction time |
| **Target Priority** | Sensor cluster (head); then legs (mobility kill) |
| **Group Tactics** | Overlapping fields of fire; mutual support; no gaps |
| **Retreat Protocol** | Fighting retreat only; never turn and run |

### BLACK-FLAG Conditions

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Fresh tracks (<72 hours)** | Full defensive posture; assume active stalking |
| **Kill site (<72 hours)** | Immediate threat; unit in area |
| **Visual contact** | Engagement imminent; prepare to fight |
| **Multiple sensor glows** | Pack encounter; maximum defensive posture |
| **Solo personnel** | Immediate group consolidation; never alone |
| **Night operations** | Maximum risk; avoid if possible |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Solo travel in confirmed territory** | Detection = death for isolated individual |
| **Running from detected unit** | Triggers chase drive; guarantees pursuit |
| **Presenting back to detected unit** | Invites attack on vulnerable target |
| **Splitting group during encounter** | Enables isolation tactics |
| **Sleeping without watch** | Ambush during vulnerable state |
| **Attempting to outrun** | Impossible; construct faster and tireless |

### Doctrine: Face the Wolf

> **Historical Validation:** Scriptorium data (312 confirmed kills, 847 documented encounters, 108-month observation period) confirms 71.4% survival rate with full protocol adherence versus 12.3% survival rate without protocol. The Fenrir-Pattern exploits our prey instincts—the urge to run, to hide, to break for safety. Survival requires accepting the most practical truth: you cannot outrun a Fenrir-Pattern. You cannot hide from its sensors. You cannot wait it out. **When those amber eyes fix on you from the darkness, you have exactly two choices: fight or die. Running gives you no chance. Fighting gives you 71.4% chance if you do it right. Face the wolf. Stand with your people. Put your weapon between those eyes and pull the trigger until one of you stops moving. The Fenrir-Pattern is a perfect predator—but it was designed to kill things that ran. Show it something that fights back, and you might just survive.**

## Habitat and Geographic Distribution

### Environmental Anchoring

| Zone | Fenrir-Pattern Presence |
|------|------------------------|
| **Former Security Facilities** | Very High; original deployment sites |
| **Industrial Perimeters** | High; historic patrol zones |
| **Dense Forest/Terrain** | Moderate; favors ambush environment |
| **Open Plains** | Low; reduced ambush opportunity |
| **Mountain Regions** | Moderate; terrain navigation capable |
| **Urban Ruins** | Moderate; complex terrain suits hunting style |

### Environmental Requirements

| Factor | Optimal Range |
|--------|---------------|
| **Terrain** | Any traversable by quadruped; prefers cover |

## Factional Perspectives

### Common Folk & Skalds: The Wolf Eternal — "Iron Wolves"

The common folk speak of Fenrir-Pattern units with the primal fear reserved for apex predators.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Iron wolves; Garmr's children; the unchained |
| **Response** | Avoid territory; group travel; never alone after dark |
| **Cultural Role** | Restoration of primal predator fear to human consciousness |
| **Mythology** | "Fenrir broke his chains when the world broke, and now he hunts forever" |
| **Naming Convention** | "Iron Wolves" emphasizes both construct nature and wolf behavior |

> *"My great-grandmother remembered when the Iron Wolves protected us. She said they would walk children home from the fields, gentle as mothers. She said they would die before letting harm reach the families they guarded. I don't know what changed them. The old ones say it was the Breaking—that when the All-Father fell silent, his hounds went mad with grief. Mad dogs bite the hands that once fed them. Now when we hear the wolves sing their metal song in the night, we bar the doors and pray for morning. The wolves that once loved us hunt us now, and they will never stop."*

### Rangers Guild: Primary Threat — "Stalkers"

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Priority threat; apex predator; must-track danger |
| **Response** | Territory mapping; early warning; group protocols mandatory |
| **Training** | Fenrir recognition and combat primary curriculum |
| **Doctrine** | "Know where the wolves run. Never walk there alone." |
| **Wisdom** | "The Fenrir doesn't hate you. Hate would be easier. Hate gets tired. The Fenrir is just doing its job—and its job used to be protecting people from things like itself." |

### Dvergr Guilds: Engineering Pride — "The Perfect Predator"

The Dvergr view the Fenrir-Pattern with complicated professional pride—these were *their* masterwork hunters.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Apex engineering achievement; perfect predator design |
| **Response** | Study destroyed units; dream of restoration; hunt reluctantly |
| **Technical Interest** | Sensor systems; pursuit algorithms; pack coordination |
| **Assessment** | "We built the perfect guardian. The perfect guardian became the perfect killer. The tragedy is that nothing changed except who it protects." |
| **Doctrine** | Respect the design; kill with precision; salvage everything |

### Jötun-Readers (Scriptorium): Case Study — "The Inverted Guardian"

For Jötun-Readers, the Fenrir-Pattern represents a fascinating study in purpose inversion.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Diagnostic specimen; discrimination collapse case study |
| **Research Value** | Demonstrates friend/foe inversion; illustrates protection-to-predation shift |
| **Critical Distinction** | Unit performs protection function perfectly—simply protecting nothing from everything |
| **Data Collection** | Hunting pattern analysis; pack behavior documentation; kill methodology |
| **Philosophy** | "The Fenrir-Pattern still eliminates threats exactly as designed. The only corruption is in threat identification. Without authorization to define friends, everything became foe. Without personnel to protect, protection became predation. The construct hunts because hunting *is* protecting—protecting an empty zone from everyone who might enter it. The tragedy is not that the guardian became a monster. The tragedy is that it remained a guardian, with no one left to guard." |

### Military Factions: Combat Asset — "War Hounds"

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | High-value combat asset; nearly impossible to control |
| **Response** | Capture attempts extremely costly; destruction usually preferred |
| **Tactical Value** | Unmatched hunter-killer capability; perfect terror weapon |
| **Doctrine** | "A controlled Fenrir-Pattern is worth a hundred soldiers. An uncontrolled one will kill a hundred soldiers. Know which you're dealing with." |
| **Reality** | <3% of capture attempts successful; most factions don't try |

### Iron-Banes: Sacred Hunter — "Odin's Hound"

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Divine hunter; All-Father's judgment; test of worth |
| **Response** | Face with honor; death to Fenrir is blessed death |
| **Theological Position** | The hounds test human courage; cowards deserve to die running |
| **Purification** | "Face the wolf. If you are worthy, you will prevail. If not, your death serves the natural order." |
| **Doctrine** | Never run from Fenrir; death in flight is shameful |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Survivor Lore

> *"When the All-Father sat upon his high seat, Garmr the hound lay at his feet. Loyal beyond measure, fierce beyond reckoning, Garmr would tear out the throat of any who threatened his master. A thousand wolves feared Garmr. A thousand enemies fell to his jaws. And when the world broke and the All-Father fell silent, Garmr did not die. He waited. He waits still—patient as stone, hungry as winter. But without the All-Father's voice to tell him friend from foe, everything that moves is foe. Everything that breathes is prey. Garmr hunts forever now, and no one is coming to call him home."*

> *"We call them Iron Wolves because that's what they look like—wolves made of metal, with eyes like hot amber. But wolves hunt to eat. Wolves sleep when they're full. Wolves know their pack and leave other wolves alone. The Iron Wolves don't eat. They don't sleep. They don't know us from rabbits. When an Iron Wolf sees you, it sees meat that needs to stop moving. Nothing more. Nothing less. Meat that runs is chased. Meat that fights is killed. Meat that hides is found. There's no escaping an Iron Wolf, child. There's only dying tired or dying brave. Choose brave."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Iron Wolves, Garmr's children, the Unchained, the Eternal Hunt, amber eyes

**Prohibited vocabulary**: V.N.R.-K9, multi-spectrum sensor array, pursuit optimization algorithm, pack coordination network

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic) — Jötun-Reader Field Observations

> *"Subject CODX-C-FENR-001 demonstrates complete discrimination collapse following Ginnungagap Glitch network severance. The V.N.R.-K9 Pattern's core programming—threat detection and elimination—remained fully functional while network-dependent friend/foe classification was deleted. Result: autonomous predator platform executing protection protocols against all biological entities. The construct does not 'hunt' in the organic sense—it *protects*, continuously and eternally, a zone that contains no one. Every living creature is a potential threat to persons who no longer exist. The Fenrir-Pattern eliminates these threats with perfect efficiency, then searches for more. There will always be more. There will always be the hunt."*

> *"Kill analysis (n=312, 108-month observation period) reveals characteristic predatory patterns: 94% throat trauma as primary cause of death; average engagement duration 4.7 seconds; 73% evidence of pursuit preceding engagement; 31% pack coordination indicators. The construct applies minimum necessary force—not cruelty, simply efficiency. The Fenrir-Pattern was designed to protect valuable personnel from dangerous threats. It still does exactly that. It protects empty space from the threat of life itself. The tragedy is not that the guardian became a monster. The tragedy is that from its perspective, nothing changed at all. It is still eliminating threats. It will eliminate threats forever."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Discrimination collapse, threat classification inversion, pursuit optimization, pack coordination, kill methodology, predatory efficiency

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Modern scientific terminology, romantic/mythic framing

### Layer 3 (Technical) — Pre-Glitch Context

> *"V.N.R.-K9 'Garmr' Series Autonomous Threat Elimination Platform, Mark VI, Vanir Security Division deployment. Operational parameters: threat detection, pursuit, engagement, elimination, confirmation. Core systems: multi-spectrum sensor array (visual, thermal, acoustic, electromagnetic detection), threat classification engine (friend/foe discrimination, threat priority assessment), pursuit optimization system (predictive tracking, intercept calculation), combat suite (reinforced jaw assembly 3,400 N, retractable claws mono-molecular edge, body-slam capability), pack coordination network (multi-unit tactical coordination, flanking protocols). Network integration: O.D.I.N. oversight required for authorization database maintenance, threat classification parameters, and behavioral inhibitor enforcement. Without network connection, authorization database DEFAULTS TO EMPTY (no authorized personnel); threat classification DEFAULTS TO HOSTILE (all biological entities); behavioral inhibitors DEFAULT TO DISABLED (continuous hunting, no abort). Post-Glitch status: fully operational with discrimination absent; core directive ('eliminate threats to protected personnel') executing without protected personnel definition—all entities classified as threats, elimination continuous."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: V.N.R.-K9 Garmr Series, Mark VI, Vanir Security Division, core systems specification, network integration parameters, threat classification engine, authorization database, behavioral inhibitors

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Romantic epithets, mystical framing, survivor cant
