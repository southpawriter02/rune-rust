## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Primal Senses is the Vargr-Born's **foundational perception passive**—the enhanced awareness that marks them as apex predators. This establishes their identity as scouts and trackers while reinforcing their mental coherence against the Blight's disorienting effects.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Grant +1d10 bonus to Wasteland Survival (Tracking) checks
- **Secondary:** Grant +1 die to Resolve Checks vs [Disoriented]
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The primal wolf senses that pierce deception and chaos

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Moderate (utility + defensive)
- **Always Active:** No resource cost for passive benefits
- **Exploration Utility:** Makes Vargr-Born excellent scouts
- **Mental Defense:** Reinforces coherent warrior identity

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Vargr-Born's eyes are not human. They see heat signatures in the cold, detect movement at the edge of perception, and taste fear on the wind. Their senses are attuned to the pure, logical rhythms of the uncorrupted world—the heartbeat of prey, the rustle of threat, the subtle wrongness of Blighted ground.

Where others stumble through the corrupted wastes, the Vargr-Born *hunts*. Every footprint tells a story. Every scent carries information. The world is a tapestry of data, and the Vargr-Born reads it with predatory precision.

### Thematic Resonance

Primal Senses establishes the Vargr-Born as a creature of pure, uncorrupted instinct—a living remnant of the world's original, stable code. Their senses are not magic; they are the natural function of an uncorrupted predator.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Tracking Bonus

**Passive Effect:**

- +1d10 bonus die to all **Wasteland Survival (Tracking)** checks
- Applies to tracking creatures, following trails, identifying passage

### Mental Clarity

**Passive Defense:**

- +1 die to Resolve Checks vs **[Disoriented]** status effect
- The coherent wolf-mind rejects the Blight's static

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Tracking Check:** When making Wasteland Survival (Tracking), add +1d10
2. **Disoriented Resist:** When rolling Resolve vs [Disoriented], add +1 die
3. **Always Active:** These bonuses apply automatically with no action required

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Predatory Lunge:** Track prey, then lunge to finish
- **Go for the Throat (Tier 2):** Sensing weakness enables precision strikes
- **Exploration parties:** Maximum value in wilderness/ruin scenarios
- **Skald (Heart of the Clan):** Combined mental defenses create coherent party

### Negative Synergies

- **Urban environments:** Tracking less useful in cities
- **Combat-only scenarios:** Limited direct combat application
- **Stationary parties:** Less value if not exploring
