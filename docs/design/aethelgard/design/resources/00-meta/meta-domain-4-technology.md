## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain Classification** | Setting Fundamentals Domain 4 of 9 |
| **Document ID** | AAM-META-SETTING-FUNDAMENTALS-v1.0 (Section 4) |
| **Function** | Technology and epistemological constraints for POST-Glitch content |
| **Layer Applicability** | Layer 2 (Diagnostic), Layer 3 (POST-Glitch sections) |
| **Status** | Critical — Highest remediation volume in v4.0 content |
| **Validation Requirement** | Mandatory for all specifications, implementations, and canonical content |

Domain 4 is the **most violated domain** in the Aethelgard setting.

It governs what POST-Glitch societies can know, measure, create, and comprehend about the technological infrastructure they inherited from the Age of Forging. It establishes the fundamental truth that defines Aethelgard's post-apocalyptic character:

**The survivors operate technology they cannot understand.**

They can activate systems. They can read Data-Slates. They can jury-rig repairs.

But they cannot **create**, **program**, or **modify** anything from the Age of Forging.

They are archaeologists, not engineers.

And Domain 4 ensures that every piece of canonical content reflects this reality.

## Foundational Principles

### The Medieval Baseline

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **800 Years of Decay** | Pre-Glitch systems persist but are malfunctioning, hazardous, and unreliable |
| **Operating Capacity** | Corrupted or unintended—systems rarely function as designed |
| **Manufacturing Loss** | No complex assembly for ~800 years |
| **Knowledge Gap** | POST-Glitch societies cannot comprehend underlying principles |

The Age of Forging ended 783 years ago. The Ginnungagap Glitch destroyed not just the infrastructure but the **knowledge base** that created it.

POST-Glitch societies exist at a **medieval technological baseline** with access to malfunctioning pre-Glitch artifacts they can operate but not understand.

### The Three Constraints

| Constraint | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Operational Use Without Comprehension** | Can activate/use systems (lockpick consoles, trigger mechanisms, read Data-Slates) but cannot create, program, or modify them |
| **Semi-Habitable At Best** | Can make areas livable through improvisation but cannot restore Pre-Glitch control levels |
| **Lost Manufacturing Capability** | Cannot create new Data-Slates or reprogram/rewrite existing content on slates |

## The Epistemological Mandate

### What POST-Glitch Observers Cannot Know

| Category | Forbidden Knowledge |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Precise Measurements** | Exact specifications, calibrated thresholds, quantified tolerances |
| **Pre-Glitch Design Intent** | Original system purposes, engineering rationale, operational parameters |
| **Programming Logic** | Code structure, algorithmic principles, runic compilation methods |
| **Manufacturing Processes** | Fabrication techniques, material synthesis, quality control protocols |

Domain 4 establishes that **precision measurement is epistemologically impossible** for POST-Glitch societies.

The Jötun-Readers—the most technologically sophisticated faction in the Age of Echoes—can identify Blight-corrupted zones through **qualitative observation** (visual distortions, psychic discomfort) but **cannot measure exact CPS thresholds**.

This is not a technological limitation. It is a **knowledge limitation**.

The instruments that could take such measurements are either destroyed, corrupted, or incomprehensible to those who attempt to use them.

### What POST-Glitch Observers CAN Know

| Category | Permitted Knowledge |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Qualitative Observations** | Visual patterns, sensory impressions, behavioral correlations |
| **Comparative Assessments** | "Greater than," "less than," relative severity |
| **Operational Heuristics** | "When X happens, do Y"—practical rules without theoretical understanding |
| **Historical Records** | Fragmentary Pre-Glitch documentation, often corrupted or incomplete |

POST-Glitch knowledge is **observer-based**, not **instrument-based**.

The Jötun-Readers have developed sophisticated qualitative taxonomies—they can distinguish between severity levels, identify patterns, and predict behaviors. But their knowledge remains **descriptive**, not **quantitative**.

## Faction-Specific Calibration

### The Jötun-Readers

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| **Read Data-Slates** | ✅ CAN — Operational use |
| **Interpret Pre-Glitch terminology** | ✅ CAN — With uncertainty and inference |
| **Use Pre-Glitch instruments** | ⚠️ LIMITED — Can activate but cannot calibrate |
| **Measure precise CPS thresholds** | ❌ CANNOT — No functional instruments |
| **Program or modify systems** | ❌ CANNOT — Knowledge permanently lost |
| **Create new Data-Slates** | ❌ CANNOT — Manufacturing capability lost |

The Jötun-Readers represent the **upper bound** of POST-Glitch technological capability. Their knowledge is the most comprehensive available—and it is still **fundamentally incomplete**.

They are **pathologists**, not **surgeons**. They can diagnose, but they cannot cure.

### The Dvergr

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| **Replicate surface patterns** | ✅ CAN — With exceptional precision |
| **Maintain geothermal systems** | ✅ CAN — Through inherited protocols |
| **Forge Pure Steel** | ✅ CAN — From virgin ore, not salvage |
| **Comprehend Aetheric principles** | ❌ CANNOT — Deliberately rejected |
| **Innovate new runic configurations** | ❌ CANNOT — Cannot advance beyond Pre-Glitch designs |

The Dvergr maintain the **highest manufacturing capability** in POST-Glitch Aethelgard—but even they are limited to **replication**, not **innovation**.

They can forge Pure Steel to Pre-Glitch specifications because they preserved the protocols. But they cannot create **new** specifications.

### The Rust-Clans

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| **Salvage functional components** | ✅ CAN — Core economic activity |
| **Jury-rig repairs** | ✅ CAN — Operational necessity |
| **Understand underlying principles** | ❌ CANNOT — "Bodge-work" is explicitly non-theoretical |
| **Restore Pre-Glitch functionality** | ❌ CANNOT — Can only approximate |

The Rust-Clans represent **practical adaptation** without comprehension. Their Rigs function through accumulated trial-and-error, not engineering knowledge.

## Measurement Restrictions

### Forbidden Precision Types

| Measurement Type | Example Violation | Status |
|------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Acoustic Frequency** | "18-35 Hz vocalization" | ❌ FORBIDDEN |
| **Decibel Levels** | "120+ dB roar" | ❌ FORBIDDEN |
| **Exact Percentages** | "73.4% efficiency" | ❌ FORBIDDEN |
| **Precise Temperatures** | "847°C operating temperature" | ❌ FORBIDDEN |
| **Calibrated Distances** | "47.3 meters detection range" | ❌ FORBIDDEN |
| **Chemical Concentrations** | "4.2 ppm mercury contamination" | ❌ FORBIDDEN |
| **Atmospheric Composition** | "21% O₂, 78% N₂" | ❌ FORBIDDEN |

### Permitted Qualitative Alternatives

| Forbidden | Permitted Alternative |
|-----------|----------------------|
| "18-35 Hz vocalization" | "Sub-audible rumble that resonates in the chest" |
| "120+ dB roar" | "Deafening cry that causes physical pain" |
| "73.4% efficiency" | "Functions poorly compared to intact examples" |
| "847°C operating temperature" | "Hot enough to melt iron on contact" |
| "47.3 meters detection range" | "Can sense intruders at javelin-throw distance" |
| "4.2 ppm mercury contamination" | "Toxic enough to cause tremors within days" |

### The Exception: Pre-Glitch Layer 3 Documents

| Context | Precision Status |
|---------|------------------|
| **Layer 3 Pre-Glitch documents** | ✅ PERMITTED — These represent historical records |
| **Layer 3 POST-Glitch documents** | ❌ FORBIDDEN — Same constraints as Layer 2 |
| **Layer 2 POST-Glitch documents** | ❌ FORBIDDEN — Observer perspective required |
| **Layer 1 documents** | ❌ FORBIDDEN — Mythic voice has no precision |

Precision measurements are only permitted when explicitly attributed to **Pre-Glitch sources**—recovered Data-Slates, archaeological fragments, corrupted technical manuals.

And even then, the POST-Glitch observer must acknowledge uncertainty about whether the recorded values remain accurate after 800 years of decay.

---

## The Observer Perspective

### Required Epistemic Stance

| Element | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **First-Person Diagnostic** | "I observed," "My assessment," "We concluded" |
| **Acknowledged Uncertainty** | "Appears to," "Believed to be," "Estimated at" |
| **Qualified Claims** | "In my experience," "Field observations suggest" |
| **Incomplete Knowledge** | Explicit gaps in understanding |

Domain 4 requires that POST-Glitch content maintain the **observer perspective**—the stance of someone who can describe what they see but cannot claim complete understanding.

### Forbidden Epistemic Claims

| Claim Type | Example | Status |
|------------|---------|--------|
| **Omniscient Knowledge** | "The Draugr feel nothing" | ❌ FORBIDDEN |
| **Precise Causation** | "The system failed because X triggered Y" | ❌ FORBIDDEN |
| **Complete Understanding** | "The rune functions by converting A to B" | ❌ FORBIDDEN |
| **Calibrated Certainty** | "There is a 73% chance of cascade failure" | ❌ FORBIDDEN |

### Permitted Epistemic Claims

| Claim Type | Example | Status |
|------------|---------|--------|
| **Observed Behavior** | "The Draugr appear to feel nothing" | ✅ PERMITTED |
| **Correlation** | "When X occurs, Y typically follows" | ✅ PERMITTED |
| **Partial Understanding** | "The rune seems to affect local Aether flow" | ✅ PERMITTED |
| **Qualitative Assessment** | "Cascade failure is likely in this configuration" | ✅ PERMITTED |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"We do not know what the gods knew. We know only what they left behind—the smoking forges that will not cool, the iron giants that will not sleep, the lights that burn without flame in the deep places. The Skalds do not sing of specifications. They sing of wonder and terror, of machines that move without breath and see without eyes. The truth of the old world is not a number. It is a feeling: the cold certainty that something is watching from the dark, something that was made for a purpose we can no longer remember."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"Domain 4 compliance represents the epistemological foundation of POST-Glitch scholarship. The Scriptorium's methodology acknowledges that 800 years of infrastructural decay, knowledge loss, and corrupted documentation have rendered precision measurement impossible for contemporary observers. We can describe what we observe. We can correlate patterns. We can develop operational heuristics. But we cannot claim the calibrated certainty that died with the Age of Forging. Our instruments are broken. Our manuals are corrupted. Our teachers are dust. We proceed with humility, knowing that every claim we make about the old world is provisional—an approximation of truth, not truth itself."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"DOMAIN 4 COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS: POST-Glitch Layer 2/3 content must maintain medieval baseline technology constraints. FORBIDDEN: Precise measurements (frequency, decibel, percentage, temperature, distance, concentration); omniscient claims about Pre-Glitch systems; POST-Glitch manufacturing of complex technology; calibrated certainty statements. REQUIRED: Observer perspective ('I observed,' 'appears to,' 'believed to be'); qualitative measurement alternatives; acknowledged epistemic uncertainty; manufacturing limitation compliance. VALIDATION GATE: 100% Domain 4 compliance required for canonical promotion. REMEDIATION PRIORITY: Domain 4 violations have highest remediation volume in v4.0 corpus."*

## Summary

Domain 4 is not a limitation.

It is the **foundation** of Aethelgard's identity.

The setting exists in the space between **operational capability** and **theoretical understanding**—a world where survivors can flip switches and pull levers, but cannot comprehend what happens when they do.

This is not ignorance. It is **epistemic humility**.

The Aesir knew everything. They had perfect measurements, perfect specifications, perfect control. And their perfection **broke reality**.

The POST-Glitch survivors do not seek that knowledge. They cannot afford it. The price of understanding may be a second Ginnungagap.

And so Domain 4 stands as the governance rule that ensures every piece of Aethelgard content respects this fundamental truth:

**We are archaeologists in the corpse of a god.**

We can describe what we find.

We can use what still functions.

We can survive in the ruins.

But we cannot **understand**.

Not because the knowledge is hidden.

Because the knowledge is **dangerous**.

And some doors—as the Apocrypha reminds us—must remain **forever closed**.
