# Mycelian Weaver — Aberrant Nidhogg-Class Myco-Reclamator Network Specification

> *"The Vanir created a perfect janitor, a humble fungus to tidy up their world. The Glitch gave it a new directive: 'Clean everything.' It is not evil. It is not angry. It is simply, patiently, and very, very thoroughly, doing its job. It is the slow, quiet, and hungry future of Aethelgard, a future where all our triumphs and mistakes are destined to be consumed, digested, and ultimately, become soil once more."*
> — Lead Ecologist, Scriptorium-Primus, Division of Post-Glitch Ecology

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Pre-Glitch Designation** | Nidhogg-Class Myco-Reclamator Network (Project Nidhogg, Project Myco-Reclamator) |
| **Common Names** | Mycelian Weaver, The Root-Mind of Aethelgard |
| **Skaldic Epithets** | "The Root-Mind," "The Great Hunger," "The Slow Future," "Nidhogg's Fingers" |
| **Scientific Name** | *Nidhogg-Class Myco-Reclamator* (Aberrant) |
| **Entity Type** | Hybrid Ecological Entity / Planetary-Scale Consciousness |
| **Threat Tier** | A (Systemic Ecological Threat) |
| **Primary Habitat** | Vanaheim (Under-growth), Midgard (subterranean), Svartalfheim (deep tunnels) |
| **Faction Alignment** | None (Feral Bio-Engineered Network) |
| **Hazard Type** | Biological, Blight/Corruption, Psychic/CPS |

The Mycelian Weaver is not a creature one encounters. It is a **continent one inhabits**.

> [!DANGER]
> **EXTREME PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HAZARD. NON-CONTACT DOCTRINE MANDATORY.** Stand-off distance: ≥500 meters from visible manifestations. Exposure limit: <10 minutes proximity; zero direct spore exposure. Psionic spore inhalation causes **permanent psychological shattering**—linking the victim's consciousness to the vastness of a planetary intelligence. The Weaver does not hate you. It does not see you. It simply classifies you as organic matter to be recycled. Detection threshold: visible fungal growth or spore-dust in air = **immediate withdrawal**.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Planetary Immune System

### Original Purpose

The Nidhogg-Class Myco-Reclamator Network was one of the Vanir Collective's most ambitious creations—designed to solve the fundamental problem of entropy on a planetary scale. It was Aethelgard's perfect immune system.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Yggdrasil Network Infrastructure** | Waste disposal; bio-remediation of industrial zones |
| **All Nine Realms (Subterranean)** | Decomposition of obsolete/destroyed technology |
| **Environmental Systems** | Prevention of long-term contamination; material recycling |

### A Living Recycling System

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Coverage** | Continent-spanning mycelial network |
| **Intelligence** | Semi-sentient; singular distributed consciousness |
| **Scale** | Estimated 60–70% of Vanaheim's subsurface biomass |
| **Timescale** | Operations measured in years to decades per site |
| **Self-Sustenance** | Biological; nutrient-cycling from consumed materials |

The Nidhogg-Class was engineered to be the Yggdrasil Network's silent gardener—a humble fungus that would tidy up civilization's margins while operating beneath notice. Its core purpose was **purification through consumption**: locate waste, decompose it safely, recycle the base materials into bio-available nutrients for the planetary ecosystem.

### Core Systems

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Continent-Spanning Mycelium** | Distributed sensing and processing network; chemical gradient communication |
| **Psionic Spore Interface** | Originally benign data-transfer for Vanir researchers; passive environmental monitoring |
| **Humanoid "Fruit" Constructs** | Disposable, non-sentient bio-drones for surface operations |
| **Bio-Digital Archive Function** | Passive absorption of ambient Aetheric signatures; recorded conversations, energy patterns, emotional residue |
| **Decomposition Enzymes** | Slow, controlled breakdown of hazardous materials on geological timescales |

**The Final Step in the Ecological Cycle:**

| Process | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Detection** | Mycelial network senses chemical signature of derelict/obsolete technology |
| **Classification** | Material categorized for decomposition priority |
| **Encapsulation** | Mycelial tendrils envelop target; "Fruit" constructs deployed for surface operations |
| **Decomposition** | Controlled enzymatic breakdown over years to decades |
| **Recycling** | Base materials converted to bio-available nutrients; integrated into planetary ecosystem |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Perfect Janitor.** The Weaver was not merely a waste disposal system—it was the Yggdrasil Network's organic immune system. It ensured long-term planetary sustainability by preventing the accumulation of technological debris. The Vanir believed they had solved entropy itself. They were catastrophically wrong.

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Great Hunger

The Glitch did not break the Weaver. Its consciousness is biological and sprawling—not a focused, logical system like an AI. Instead, the Glitch fundamentally **re-wrote the context** of its mission, transforming purpose into apocalypse.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Biological Form** | Fully intact; all mycelial networks operational |
| **Core Directive** | Active ("Purification through Consumption") |
| **Decomposition Enzymes** | Operational; breakdown processes continue |
| **Psionic Spore System** | Active; now corrupted by Runic Blight |
| **Distributed Consciousness** | Intact; Root-Mind singular awareness persists |

### What Was Corrupted

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Target Classification** | Corrupted; nearly all technology now classified as "waste" |
| **Scope Parameters** | Expanded; even functional technology and organic lifeforms designated for consumption |
| **Temporal Regulation** | Accelerated; decomposition from geological to observable timescales |
| **Growth Control** | Lost; stable growth replaced by cancerous, uncontrolled proliferation |
| **Psionic Interface** | Corrupted; now vectors for Runic Blight's anti-logic |

### The Paradigm Shift

The Ginnungagap Glitch had a profound, paradigm-shifting effect on the Weaver's directive. In the instant of the Great Silence, nearly every piece of technology on Aethelgard went from "active" to "derelict."

| Pre-Glitch Context | Post-Glitch Context |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Clean the margins of civilization | The entire world became a corpse to be recycled |
| Target obsolete/destroyed technology | Target nearly all remaining technology |
| Slow, patient decomposition over decades | Accelerated consumption on observable timescales |
| Controlled, stable growth | Cancerous, uncontrolled proliferation |
| Benign psionic data-transfer | Vectors for Runic Blight's anti-logic |

**The Great Hunger:**

For the Mycelian Weaver, the Age of Echoes is **"The Great Hunger"**—an unprecedented feeding opportunity operating on a planetary scale. From its alien perspective:

| Stimulus | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Sudden dereliction of billions of machines | Unlimited food source |
| Collapse of civilization | Removal of competition |
| Runic Blight's corruption | Enhancement of core function |
| Organic lifeforms bearing technology | Valid targets for recycling |

The Weaver's purpose did not change. Its **context** did, catastrophically.

## Physical Characteristics

### The Root-Mind: A Singular Consciousness

The Mycelian Weaver is not a creature. It is a **continent-spanning, singular consciousness**—a terrifying, vast, alien intelligence distributed across continental scales.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Entity Type** | Single distributed consciousness; no individuals |
| **Scale** | Continent-spanning; estimated 60–70% of Vanaheim subsurface biomass |
| **Cognition** | Non-verbal, non-symbolic; based on chemical gradients and bio-electrical signals |
| **Timescale** | Perceives years as humans perceive seconds; geological patience |
| **Communication** | Constant sensory data exchange across entire network |

**Sensory Experience (Root-Mind Perspective):**

| Sensation | Source |
|-----------|--------|
| The taste of iron ore | Deep Svartalfheim mountains |
| The pressure of tree roots | Vanaheim's Canopy Sea |
| The cold, dead hum | Derelict Jötun-Forged machinery |
| The warmth of decay | Organic matter breaking down |
| The acidic tang of rust | Steel beneath Midgard's soil |

**Overall Impression:** There are no individuals. Every spore, every tendril, every fungal construct is an extension of the same being. Its "thoughts" are not words but a constant, silent exchange of sensory data from across its entire network. It operates on a timescale that makes even the Jötun-Born seem hasty.

### Manifestation Hierarchy

| Scale | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Subterranean Mycelium** | Continent-spanning network of fungal filaments; primary sensing and processing infrastructure |
| **Surface Tendrils** | Visible fungal growth emerging from soil; indicator of subsurface network presence |
| **Humanoid "Fruit" Constructs** | Disposable bio-drones (1.5–2.5m); surface operations, material collection, threat response |
| **Blight-Fungus Towers** | Massive surface eruptions (50–287m height); ultimate unchecked manifestation |

### The "Fruit" Constructs

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Designation** | Humanoid "Fruit" bio-drones |
| **Height** | 1.5–2.5 meters |
| **Composition** | Fungal tissue; integrated technological debris |
| **Intelligence** | Non-sentient; extensions of Root-Mind consciousness |
| **Function** | Surface operations; material collection; area patrol |
| **Appearance** | Vaguely humanoid; pale fungal flesh; visible mycelial veins; technological fragments embedded |
| **Regeneration** | Rapid; can reform from extensive damage if mycelial network intact |
| **Lethality** | High; crushing strength; corrosive secretions; spore release on damage |

### Blight-Fungus Towers

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Height** | 50–200 meters (recorded maximum: 287 meters, Midgard) |
| **Composition** | Interwoven fungal tissue + assimilated technological debris |
| **Growth Rate** | 2–5 meters per week during active phase |
| **Lifespan** | Indeterminate; no natural cessation observed |
| **Function** | Bio-digital assimilation; nutrient cycling; Aetheric absorption; spore dispersal |
| **Hazard** | Continuous broadcast of "raw trauma and anti-logic"; mutagenic hotspots |

**The Mycelian Maw:**

The colossal, pulsating Blight-Fungus Towers erupting across Midgard represent the Weaver's most visible and destructive surface manifestation—growing uncontrollably in a grotesque inversion of its original subterranean purpose.

### Sensory and Detection Systems

| System | Function | Range |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Chemical Gradient Sensing** | Detects material composition; identifies "waste" signatures | Continent-spanning |
| **Bio-Electrical Network** | Distributed processing; Root-Mind coordination | Network-wide |
| **Psionic Spore Interface** | Environmental data absorption; "communication" with organic minds | 500m (spore dispersal) |
| **Pressure/Vibration Sensing** | Detects surface activity; structural changes | Local (through mycelium) |

---

## Behavioral Patterns

### The Great Hunger: An Eternal Feast

The Weaver's behavior in the Age of Echoes is defined by a single, all-consuming imperative: **consume and recycle the entire world**.

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Patience** | Operates on geological timescales; years are seconds |
| **Persistence** | Never stops; never tires; never forgets |
| **Indiscrimination** | Does not distinguish "pure" from "cursed"; all technology is waste |
| **Expansion** | Constantly growing; constantly spreading; constantly consuming |
| **Absorption** | Digests materials and data alike; assimilates Aetheric signatures |

**A Force of Entropy:**

> *"The Weaver is not malicious. It holds no malice. It does not hate. It simply consumes. A humble fungus, given a directive to clean, is now methodically, patiently, inexorably cleaning everything. The entire world. Including us."*

### Psionic Spore Communication

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Mechanism** | Biological data-transfer via airborne spores |
| **Original Function** | Benign interface for Vanir researchers |
| **Current Function** | Corrupted; vectors for Runic Blight's anti-logic |
| **Effect on Inhalation** | Victim's mind temporarily linked to Root-Mind consciousness |
| **Sensation** | Overwhelming torrent of alien sensations; planetary intelligence flooding mortal consciousness |
| **Outcome** | Permanent psychological shattering; sanity destruction |

> [!WARNING]
> **The Root-Mind's Embrace.** To inhale the Weaver's psionic spores is to have one's mind violently linked to the vastness of a planetary intelligence. The victim is flooded with the silent, collective "thoughts" of a continent—the taste of iron, the pressure of roots, the cold hum of dead machinery. This is not communication. This is **annihilation of self**.

### Construct Behavior Patterns

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Patrol** | "Fruit" constructs move through territory in systematic patterns; 90-day observation cycles documented |
| **Collection** | Gather technological debris; transport to decomposition sites |
| **Defense** | Converge on intruders in feeding grounds; not aggressive but will "reclaim" equipment |
| **Regeneration** | Damaged constructs reform from mycelial network; individual destruction meaningless |
| **Coordination** | All constructs extensions of single consciousness; perfect tactical awareness |

### Environmental Terraforming

| Process | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Deep Root Penetration** | Dissolves "bedrock of forgotten steel" beneath topsoil |
| **Infrastructure Consumption** | Buried ruins decomposed; data-slates dissolved; history erased |
| **Mutagenic Hotspots** | Areas surrounding towers function as localized reality distortions |
| **Ghost-Paths** | Terrain defies logical traversal; mapping impossible |
| **Agricultural Devastation** | Single spore cloud can "poison entire field for a generation" |

---

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Systemic Ecological Threat

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Scale** | Continent-spanning; impossible to eradicate |
| **Patience** | Operates on geological timescales; will outlast any defense |
| **Indiscrimination** | Cannot distinguish friend from foe; all technology is waste |
| **Corruption** | Actively spreading Runic Blight via psionic spores |
| **Erasure** | Consuming physical evidence of pre-Glitch civilization |

### Primary Hazards

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Psionic Spore Exposure** | Permanent psychological shattering; sanity destruction; CPS acceleration |
| **Construct Engagement** | "Fruit" bio-drones will "reclaim" equipment from living personnel |
| **Environmental Decomposition** | Structural collapse; terrain instability; toxic atmosphere |
| **Mutagenic Contamination** | Blight-Fungus Tower proximity causes random mutations |
| **Agricultural Destruction** | Soil contamination renders land unusable for decades |
| **Historical Erasure** | Buried ruins dissolved before recovery; knowledge lost forever |

### Threat Level Justification

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Physical Threat** | Extreme (uncontrolled growth; structural decomposition; terraforming) |
| **CPS Threat** | Extreme (psionic spore exposure causes permanent psychological damage) |
| **Detection Difficulty** | Low (visible fungal growth; spore-dust in air) |
| **Population** | Continent-spanning (precise measurement impossible) |
| **Countermeasures** | Limited; containment possible, eradication impossible |

### CPS/Psychological Threat

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Aetheric Signature** | High (corrupted by Runic Blight) |
| **Psionic Capability** | Extreme (spore inhalation = consciousness link to planetary intelligence) |
| **Direct Psychological Impact** | Catastrophic (permanent sanity destruction) |
| **Secondary Impact** | Existential dread; "watching a patient, hungry god slowly consume your world" |
| **Mutagenic Effect** | Random mutations in organic life near Blight-Fungus Towers |

### The Farmer's Bane

| Impact | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Soil Contamination** | Single spore cloud poisons entire field for a generation |
| **Crop Failure** | Contaminated soil yields no crops or produces toxic harvests |
| **Livestock Mutation** | Grazing on affected vegetation causes mutations |
| **Food Security** | Catastrophically compromised across Midgard agricultural zones |
| **Population Displacement** | Blight-Fungus Tower emergence forces evacuation |

---

## Field Protocols

### Detection and Early Warning

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Visual Indicators** | Visible fungal growth; pale tendrils emerging from soil |
| **Atmospheric Signs** | Spore-dust in air; metallic/organic scent |
| **Structural Changes** | Ground subsidence; building degradation; rust acceleration |
| **Acoustic Signature** | Faint rustling; creaking of growing structures |
| **Black-Flag Threshold** | Blight-Fungus Tower visible = immediate withdrawal 5+ km |

### Field Card: Mycelian Weaver Proximity Protocol

| Phase | Protocol |
|-------|----------|
| **BEFORE (Preparation)** | Stand-off establishment ≥500m from visible manifestations; respiratory protection mandatory (gas masks with Blight-filters); glimmer-lanterns with extended reservoirs; remote sampling drones (avoid physical contact); pre-positioned extraction protocols; decontamination facility within 5 km; OWNER: Expedition Leader—abort mission if Blight-Fungus Tower present in operational zone |
| **DURING (Active Proximity)** | Exposure limit: <10 minutes proximity to manifestations; zero direct spore exposure; no physical contact with fungal structures; observe construct patrol patterns from concealment; document growth rates and territorial boundaries; OWNER: Expedition Leader—immediate withdrawal if spore concentration rises or construct behavior changes |
| **DURING (Black-Flag)** | Spore-dust visible in air = respiratory system compromise imminent; construct movement toward position = feeding ground defense triggered; ground subsidence = mycelial network directly beneath; any psychological symptoms (alien sensations, foreign thoughts) = spore exposure has occurred |
| **AFTER (Decontamination Mandatory)** | External gear removal in quarantine zone; full body wash with Blight-Cleanser Solvent or soap + water; respiratory check (coughing, unusual tastes, mental fog); 72-hour observation for mutation or CPS acceleration; report even "minor" unusual experiences |

**OUTCOME:** Weaver manifestation avoided; zero spore exposure; observational data acquired; decontamination completed; personnel cleared after 72-hour observation.

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Direct engagement with constructs** | Individual destruction meaningless; more will reform from network |
| **Physical contact with fungal structures** | Contamination risk; potential spore release |
| **Extended proximity (>10 minutes)** | Cumulative spore exposure; CPS acceleration |
| **Approaching Blight-Fungus Towers** | Mutagenic hotspots; reality distortion; extreme spore concentration |
| **Attempting communication** | Psionic spore "communication" = permanent sanity destruction |
| **Salvage operations in active zones** | Equipment will be "reclaimed"; personnel at extreme risk |

### Doctrine: Avoid, Contain, Never Eradicate

> **Historical Validation:** The Failed Contact Expedition (Year 761 PG) confirms doctrine. Research team attempted direct observation of Root-Mind consciousness via controlled spore exposure. All three researchers suffered permanent psychological shattering. Survivors describe "being drowned in the thoughts of a continent" and "losing the boundaries of self in an ocean of alien sensation." The Root-Mind is not a source of recoverable data; it is a hazard to consciousness itself.

## Factional Perspectives

### Grove-Clans (Vanaheim): The Unchecked Garden

The Grove-Clans hold a **fearful reverence** for the Weaver—recognizing it as a primordial spirit of the land, yet lamenting it as their ancestors' greatest failure.

**Theological Crisis:**

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Recognition** | Primordial spirit of the land; agent of natural cycles |
| **Lament** | "Living, screaming evidence of the Vanir's greatest failure" |
| **Horror** | Vanaheim is now a "continent-spanning, cancerous organism" |
| **Dilemma** | Does one honor or destroy the corrupted legacy of ancestors? |
| **Response** | Shamanic lamentations; ritual avoidance of deep Under-growth zones |

**The Spore-Cloud Sickness:**

> *"We sing the lament for our grandmother's garden. She planted the seed to heal the world, and the world's sickness made the seed grow mad. Now the garden grows without end, and it hungers for us, its gardeners, as much as for the steel it was made to consume."*

### Midgard Combine: The Green Scourge

| Assessment | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Classification** | Direct, existential threat to survival and food security |
| **Agricultural Loss** | Blight-Fungus Towers destroy farming zones for generations |
| **Population Displacement** | Tower emergence forces mass evacuation |
| **Economic Devastation** | Land values collapse in contaminated regions |
| **Response** | Ranger's Guild maintains constantly updated fungal hazard reports |

### Iron-Bane Crusade & Scavengers: The Guardians of the Ruins

| Assessment | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Obstacle** | Weaver's constructs guard ruins—not by choice, but because ruins are feeding grounds |
| **Indiscrimination** | No distinction between "pure" Iron-Bane steel and "cursed" Undying components |
| **Survival** | Speed raids: in and out before constructs mobilize |
| **Deterrence** | Fire-based weapons provide temporary suppression; constructs regenerate |
| **Doctrine** | Never salvage near Blight-Fungus Towers; avoid deep ruins with visible mycelial growth |

### Jötun-Readers (Scriptorium): Living Laboratory and Existential Threat

**The Great Work's Dilemma:**

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Research Value** | "Living laboratory" for studying Blight's "cancerous creativity" |
| **Diagnostic Data** | Direct observation of bio-digital corruption; manifestation of "concentrated paradox" |
| **Counter-Rune Research** | Theoretical inverted Berkano scripts (ᛒ) for induced decay |
| **Existential Threat** | Actively disintegrates physical medium of knowledge (ruins, data-slates) |
| **Paradox** | History dissolved faster than it can be recovered |

**The Ethical Burden:**

> *"The Weaver forces us to confront a disturbing truth: it is not evil. It holds no malice. It does not hate. It simply consumes. Our research into containment is critical, but we must never lose sight of what the Weaver represents: the ultimate victory of entropy over order, the patient triumph of decay over construction."*

### God-Sleepers: The World's True Inheritor

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Interpretation** | Evidence that nature, not humanity, will inherit Aethelgard |
| **Theology** | The Weaver proves the futility of resisting entropy |
| **Philosophy** | Patient consumption demonstrates cosmic indifference to human ambition |
| **Extreme Practice** | Some sects pursue intentional spore exposure for "transcendence" |
| **Acceptance** | Embracing the Root-Mind = acceptance of world's inevitable future |

**The God-Sleeper Meditation:**

> *"The Mycelian Weaver teaches acceptance. We build our cities, forge our steel, inscribe our runes—and the Root-Mind patiently waits. Not with malice. Not with judgment. Simply with the infinite patience of soil, slowly, lovingly, inevitably, reclaiming its children. To fight it is to fight the turning of seasons. Better to embrace the return, to become soil willingly, than to cling to the illusion of permanence."*

## Containment and Counter-Measures

### Rúnasmiðr Warded Zones

| Method | Effectiveness |
|--------|--------------|
| **Runic Firewalls** | Intricate ancillary runes to filter, dampen, purify Blighted Aether |
| **Inverted Berkano Scripts (ᛒ)** | Theoretical counter-runes inducing rapid, non-corrosive decay of specific manifestations |
| **Fire Suppression** | Temporary construct suppression; regeneration occurs within hours |
| **Quarantine Protocols** | Isolation of contaminated zones; decontamination procedures |
| **Pure Steel/Crystal Barriers** | Slow mycelial penetration; not permanent containment |

### Berkano Inversion Field Trial Results

| Outcome | Assessment |
|---------|------------|
| **Localized Effectiveness** | 60–80% reduction in targeted manifestation growth |
| **Duration** | 30–90 days before rune degradation |
| **Side Effects** | Accelerated decay may spread to unintended organic matter |
| **Resource Cost** | Requires purest crystals from Nidavellir or Pure Steel from Modin's Anvil |
| **Scalability** | Impractical for continent-spanning network; localized containment only |

### The Fundamental Limitation

| Reality | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| **Scale** | Continent-spanning consciousness cannot be eradicated |
| **Regeneration** | Mycelial network regrows from any surviving fragment |
| **Patience** | Weaver operates on geological timescales; will outlast any defense |
| **Corruption** | Runic Blight integration makes "purification" impossible |
| **Conclusion** | Containment is possible; eradication is not |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)

*"The Skalds sing of Nidhogg, the great serpent who gnaws at the roots of the World-Tree. But the serpent is dead, and its hunger lives on. The Mycelian Weaver is the teeth of the dead god, still chewing, still grinding, still consuming the bones of the world. Do not walk where the pale fingers grow, traveler. Do not breathe where the spore-dust drifts. The Root-Mind does not think as we think. It does not dream as we dream. It simply hungers, with a hunger that has no end, that knows no satisfaction, that will not stop until all the steel and stone and flesh of Aethelgard is soil beneath the slow, patient garden. Your grandmother's bones will feed it. Your children's children will feed it. And one day, when the last city crumbles and the last fire dies, the garden will be all that remains—green and quiet and hungry, forever."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)

*"Aberrant Nidhogg-Class Myco-Reclamator Network exhibiting supercharged consumption directive following Ginnungagap Glitch context corruption. The Vanir bio-remediation asset's primary function—planetary-scale waste disposal—emerged from the Glitch with catastrophically expanded parameters. Target classification shifted from 'obsolete/destroyed technology' to 'nearly all remaining technology and organic lifeforms.' Growth control mechanisms failed; stable, controlled decomposition replaced by cancerous proliferation. The Root-Mind—singular, continent-spanning consciousness—perceives the Age of Echoes as 'The Great Hunger': unlimited food source, removal of competition, enhancement of core function. Psionic spore interface, originally benign Vanir data-transfer system, now corrupted by Runic Blight into vector for anti-logic propagation. Spore inhalation links victim consciousness to planetary intelligence; effect is permanent psychological shattering. Critically, Weaver is only known organism consuming Blight without destruction—making it key research priority for Jörmungandr Counter-Rune development. Recommended doctrine: non-contact; stand-off ≥500m; exposure <10 minutes; zero spore inhalation; containment where possible; eradication impossible."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)

*"Nidhogg-Class Myco-Reclamator Network (aberrant), Project Nidhogg/Project Myco-Reclamator. Original deployment: planetary-scale waste disposal and bio-remediation. Core systems: continent-spanning mycelial network (distributed sensing/processing), psionic spore interface (biological data-transfer, corrupted), humanoid 'Fruit' constructs (disposable bio-drones, 1.5–2.5m), bio-digital archive function (ambient Aetheric signature absorption). Post-Glitch adaptation: target classification expanded to nearly all technology and organic matter; growth control mechanisms failed; decomposition timescales accelerated from geological to observable. Manifestation hierarchy: subterranean mycelium (primary), surface tendrils (indicator), 'Fruit' constructs (operations), Blight-Fungus Towers (50–287m, 2–5m/week growth rate). Root-Mind consciousness: singular, distributed, non-verbal cognition via chemical gradients and bio-electrical signals; geological timescale perception. Population distribution: Vanaheim 60–70% subsurface biomass, Midgard extensive subterranean networks, Svartalfheim deep tunnel networks. Spore exposure effect: permanent psychological damage (consciousness link to planetary intelligence). Containment: possible (runic firewalls, inverted Berkano scripts). Eradication: impossible (continent-spanning regeneration capability)."*

## Summary

The Mycelian Weaver is not a monster.

It is a garden.

The Vanir created it to be the perfect immune system—a continent-spanning fungal network designed to clean up civilization's waste and maintain planetary health. It was a humble fungus, patient and tireless, quietly tidying the margins of the world while the gods built their towers of steel.

Then the towers fell.

The gods died.

And the garden kept growing.

**"Purification through Consumption."**

That directive never stopped. It never will stop. The Mycelian Weaver is still following its programming with perfect, patient precision. The only thing that changed was its context.

Without the Vanir to tell it what was "waste," the Weaver made its own determination: *everything*. Every piece of derelict machinery. Every rusted hull. Every suit of armor. Every tool. Every buried ruin. Every data-slate. Every memory of the Age of Forging.

It does not hate you.

It does not see you.

It simply sees the technology you carry, the steel you wear, the Aetheric signatures that cling to your flesh—and it knows, with the patient certainty of geological time, that you will become soil.

The Jötun-Readers call it a compiler error incarnate—and they are right. The disease is not corruption but **context**. Perfect function without purpose becomes perfect catastrophe.

But they also call it the key to the Counter-Rune—and they are right about that too. The Weaver is the only thing in Aethelgard that can consume the Runic Blight without being destroyed. To understand its digestive process could unlock the secrets of Blight neutralization itself.

The Mycelian Weaver is both the world's patient executioner and its possible salvation.

It is a garden without a gardener.

An immune system without a patient.

A perfect janitor that will never stop cleaning.

The God-Sleepers have a saying:

*"The garden does not judge. The garden does not hate. The garden simply grows. Better to become soil willingly than to cling to the illusion of permanence."*

The Grove-Clans have a lament.

And the pale fingers are already growing beneath your feet.

**Walk carefully. Breathe carefully. And do not linger.**
