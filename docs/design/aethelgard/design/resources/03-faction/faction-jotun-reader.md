# The Jötun-Reader Creed — Archivists of the Broken Saga

> *"The Skalds sing of us as the Grey Scribes, the quiet, stooped figures who haunt the ruins, not for treasure, but for truth. We are the keepers of the old world's ghosts, the readers of its dead language. The Iron-Banes call us heretics. The God-Sleepers call us fools. But we are the inheritors of the Aesir's greatest gift and their most terrible burden: the belief that the universe is a problem that can be solved."*
> — Archivist-Prime Sigrún, First Scriptorium

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Classification** | Major Creed (One of Three) |
| **Common Names** | The Debuggers, The Grey Scribes, The Archivists |
| **Core Philosophy** | Knowledge is Salvation |
| **Primary Settlements** | Scriptoriums (fortified libraries) |
| **Leadership Structure** | Hierarchical monastic order |
| **Relationship to Blight** | Study, contain, understand |

The Jötun-Readers are the intellectual heirs of the Aesir Technocracy, tempered by the brutal lesson of their ancestors' ultimate failure. In an age dominated by the visceral responses of fear (the Iron-Banes) and faith (the God-Sleepers), they alone cling to the dangerous conviction that the catastrophe can be understood—and perhaps, one day, undone.

They are not priests or warriors.

They are the last scientists of a broken world.

## Core Dogma: The World Is Broken, Not Cursed

### The Fundamental Truth

| Iron-Banes Say | God-Sleepers Say | Jötun-Readers Know |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| "The machines are demons." | "The machines are sleeping gods." | "The machines are malfunctioning tools." |
| "Destroy the corruption." | "Worship the divine remnants." | "Understand the system error." |
| "Purge and survive." | "Pray and await awakening." | "Debug and rebuild." |

The Jötun-Readers reject both superstitious terror and blind faith. They assert a harder truth:

> *"The world is not cursed; it is broken. The Runic Blight is not a magical plague; it is a compiler error in the fabric of reality. The Jötun-Forged are not sleeping gods; they are malfunctioning machines. The Forlorn are not ghosts; they are traumatic data-echoes. The ancestors were not gods—they were brilliant programmers who made a single, catastrophic error."*

### The Great Work

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Goal** | "Debug" reality by recovering the lost "source code" of the past |
| **Method** | Systematic preservation, study, and analysis of pre-Glitch knowledge |
| **Ultimate Hope** | Discover a "counter-rune" or "software patch" to mend the wound in the Aether |
| **Timeline** | Generations; possibly centuries |

The Great Work is not a project with an end date. It is a sacred purpose that defines every aspect of Jötun-Reader existence—the slow, painstaking reclamation of lost knowledge, not to repeat the ancestors' hubris, but to understand their error.

## Origins: The Keepers of the Logs

### Who They Were

The founders of the Jötun-Readers were not the great leaders or warriors of the Age of Forging.

| Pre-Glitch Role | Post-Glitch Contribution |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Librarians | Preserved surviving texts |
| Data-archivists | Maintained readable records |
| Low-level technicians | Understood practical systems |
| Junior scientists | Applied analytical methods |

They were the people whose lives had been dedicated to the quiet, steady accumulation of knowledge—the ones who knew where the backups were stored, who had read the error logs, who understood that systems leave traces even when they fail.

### The Founding Insight

While others fled or fought or prayed, the proto-Readers did something different: they **documented**.

They recorded what they saw. They preserved what they could. They asked *why* when everyone else was asking *how do we survive*.

And in doing so, they laid the foundation for the only faction that treats the Ginnungagap Glitch as a problem to be solved rather than a curse to be endured or a miracle to be worshipped.

## The Prophet Loki: The Tragic Visionary

### The Inner Circle's Secret

| Public Knowledge | Inner Circle Truth |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Loki was a trickster figure in the old myths | Loki was Chief Arcane Engineer of the Aesir Technocracy |
| The Glitch was an accident | Loki predicted the catastrophe |
| The All-Rune caused random destruction | Loki attempted to stop it |

Alone among all factions, the inner circle of the Scriptoriums reveres Chief Arcane Engineer Loki not as a trickster, but as a **secret, tragic prophet**.

They have partially decoded his final logs and know that he was the only one who saw the catastrophe coming.

### The Jörmungandr Protocol

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Classification** | Most holy and sought-after text |
| **Content** | Loki's research into a "counter-rune" |
| **Status** | Fragmentary; partially decoded |
| **Significance** | Potential key to the Great Work |

Loki's lost research—the secret of his "Jörmungandr" counter-rune—represents the Jötun-Readers' greatest hope and most dangerous quest. Finding and decoding the complete Protocol is the ultimate goal of their most elite expeditions.

## Society and Structure: The Monks of Reason

### The Scriptoriums

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Type** | Fortified libraries |
| **Location** | Often built in/around pre-Glitch data centers or universities |
| **Function** | Preservation, research, governance, education |
| **Atmosphere** | Quiet, ordered sanctuaries of reason in a chaotic world |

A Scriptorium is not merely a library—it is a monastery, a university, a fortress, and a government all in one. Within its walls, knowledge is the highest currency, and the pursuit of understanding is the highest calling.

### Ranks of the Order

| Rank | Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------|------------------|
| **Acolytes** | Initiates | Learn literacy, Old Tongue, core tenets |
| **Scribes** | Field agents | Expedition into ruins; copy inscriptions; salvage data-slates |
| **Archivists** | Senior scholars | Analyze findings; maintain collections; teach |
| **Lex-Guardians** | Warrior-scholars | Protect Scriptoriums; guard expeditions |
| **Archivist-Prime** | Leadership | Govern Scriptoriums; direct Great Work |

### The Meritocracy of Intellect

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Advancement** | Based on contribution to knowledge |
| **Authority** | Derived from expertise, not birth |
| **Debate** | Encouraged within proper channels |
| **Heresy** | Pursuing knowledge without proper safeguards |

Jötun-Reader society is a meritocracy where intellectual achievement is the primary measure of worth. A brilliant Acolyte can rise to Archivist; a foolish Archivist can be demoted to cataloging duty in the deep stacks.

---

## The Lex-Guardians: Warriors of the Word

### Purpose

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Protection** | Defend Scriptoriums from external threats |
| **Escort** | Guard Scribes on dangerous expeditions |
| **Enforcement** | Ensure compliance with Scriptorium law |
| **Recovery** | Retrieve valuable knowledge from hostile territory |

The Lex-Guardians are the martial arm of the Jötun-Readers—warrior-scholars trained in both combat and the fundamentals of the Creed. They are not mere soldiers; they understand *why* the knowledge they protect matters.

### Training

| Component | Focus |
|-----------|-------|
| **Combat** | Practical defense; ruin survival |
| **Scholarship** | Basic literacy; recognition of valuable artifacts |
| **Protocol** | Proper handling of dangerous materials |
| **Theology** | Deep understanding of the Creed |

A Lex-Guardian can recognize a corrupted rune-form before it triggers. They know which artifacts are safe to touch and which will drive a person mad. They are the shield that allows the Scribes to do their work.

## Methodology: The Diagnostic Approach

### The Layer 2 Perspective

| Layer | Perspective | Jötun-Reader Approach |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| Layer 1 (Mythic) | "The gods sleep in iron tombs." | Acknowledged as cultural context |
| **Layer 2 (Diagnostic)** | "Corrupted firmware loops in dormant automata." | **Primary analytical framework** |
| Layer 3 (Technical) | "System architecture specifications." | Aspirational goal; dangerous to access |

The Jötun-Readers operate primarily from the Layer 2 (Diagnostic) perspective—clinical, analytical, research-oriented. They acknowledge Layer 1 mythology as cultural data but seek to penetrate to Layer 2 understanding. Layer 3 (true technical knowledge) is the ultimate goal, but accessing it directly is recognized as extremely dangerous.

### Research Protocols

| Protocol | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Documentation** | Record everything; assume nothing is insignificant |
| **Triangulation** | Cross-reference multiple sources |
| **Containment** | Isolate dangerous artifacts before study |
| **Peer Review** | No conclusion accepted without verification |
| **Ethical Bounds** | Some knowledge is too dangerous to pursue |

### The Dangerous Truth

| What They Know | Why It's Dangerous |
|----------------|-------------------|
| The Blight is a system error | Understanding it requires exposure to it |
| The Forlorn are data-echoes | Reading them risks Cognitive Paradox Syndrome |
| The machines can be analyzed | Getting close enough to analyze them is often fatal |
| Layer 3 truth exists | The "cold, logical truth" of the Age of Forging is a "Ginnungagap Glitch for the soul" |

The Jötun-Readers walk a razor's edge. They pursue knowledge that can destroy the minds of those who seek it too eagerly. The Scriptoriums have lost many brilliant minds to the very research that defines their purpose.

## Factional Relations

### The Iron-Banes: Murderous Iconoclasts

| Jötun-Reader View | Iron-Bane View |
|-------------------|----------------|
| "Fearful zealots destroying priceless data." | "Heretics who consort with the machines." |
| "Their purges set back our understanding by decades." | "Their studies perpetuate the corruption." |
| "Useful as muscle; dangerous as neighbors." | "Useful as scouts; damned as scholars." |

The Iron-Banes and Jötun-Readers are natural enemies—not because they hate each other, but because their fundamental approaches are incompatible. Every machine the Iron-Banes destroy is knowledge the Readers will never recover.

### The God-Sleepers: Soulless Fools

| Jötun-Reader View | God-Sleeper View |
|-------------------|------------------|
| "Faith-addled dreamers worshipping malfunctioning hardware." | "Soulless fools performing autopsies on prayers." |
| "Their theology is a comforting delusion." | "Their 'understanding' is the ultimate sacrilege." |
| "At least they preserve the machines intact." | "They desecrate what they should venerate." |

The God-Sleepers view the Readers with sorrowful pity and intense contempt—they commit the heresy of trying to *understand* a god instead of worshipping it. The Readers find this attitude baffling and frustrating.

### The Dvergr: Respectable Colleagues

| Jötun-Reader View | Dvergr View |
|-------------------|-------------|
| "Practical allies who share our respect for knowledge." | "Eccentric colleagues pursuing abstract, dangerous truths." |
| "Their engineering expertise complements our research." | "Their research occasionally produces useful schematics." |
| "Their rejection of Aetheric manipulation is limiting but understandable." | "Their obsession with Aetheric systems is concerning but tolerable." |

The Dvergr and Jötun-Readers enjoy a relationship of mutual respect—both value knowledge, though they pursue different kinds. The Dvergr want practical schematics; the Readers want theoretical understanding.

### The Rust-Clans: Useful Barbarians

| Jötun-Reader View | Rust-Clan View |
|-------------------|----------------|
| "Pragmatic survivors with valuable local knowledge." | "Grey-robes who pay well for useless scrap." |
| "Their bodge-work is crude but occasionally insightful." | "Their 'analysis' is fancy words for obvious things." |
| "Essential guides in Jötunheim." | "Soft scholars who can't survive without us." |

The Rust-Clans and Jötun-Readers have a transactional relationship. The Clans know where the salvage is; the Readers pay well for it. Neither fully respects the other, but both recognize the value of cooperation.

## Sacred Texts and Forbidden Knowledge

### The Canon

| Text | Status | Content |
|------|--------|---------|
| **The Foundational Canons** | Core scripture | Basic tenets; research ethics; organizational law |
| **The Error Logs** | Holy texts | Preserved records of the Ginnungagap Glitch |
| **The Loki Fragments** | Most sacred | Partial decoding of Loki's final research |
| **The Taxonomies of Paradox** | Reference | Classification systems for Blight phenomena |

### Forbidden Knowledge

| Category | Reason for Restriction |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Direct Layer 3 Access** | Risk of cognitive collapse |
| **Forlorn Communion Protocols** | Extreme Psychic Stress |
| **All-Rune Reconstructions** | Potential to trigger new Glitch |
| **Einherjar Interface Schematics** | Silver Cord exposure |

Not all knowledge is safe to pursue. The Jötun-Readers maintain strict protocols about what can be researched, by whom, and under what safeguards. Some knowledge is locked away not because it's wrong, but because it's too dangerous.

---

## The Creed's Commandments

### The Core Tenets

> *"Hark! We are the readers of the World's-Scar, the listeners to the God-Echoes. We do not seek the Un-Truth that broke the world; we guard the truths that remain. The Saga is broken. Let no man seek to write the verses that were torn out."*

### The Commandments

1. **Preserve what remains.** Every fragment of pre-Glitch knowledge is sacred.
2. **Understand, but do not repeat.** We study the ancestors' error, not to replicate it, but to comprehend it.
3. **Document everything.** The unrecorded is the forgotten; the forgotten is the lost.
4. **Question, but verify.** No conclusion is accepted without evidence and peer review.
5. **Contain the dangerous.** Some knowledge must be locked away until we are ready.
6. **Fear the three poisons.** The Runic Blight that twists the soul, the pride that twists the law, and the cold truth that twists the mind.

## Specializations and Roles

### Jötun-Reader (Player Specialization)

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Archetype** | Adept |
| **Primary Attributes** | WITS / WILL |
| **Core Ability** | Analyze Old World technology; identify weaknesses |
| **Special Feature** | Can interface with dormant systems |
| **Trauma Risk** | Moderate (Psychic Stress from analysis) |

The Jötun-Reader specialization represents a trained field agent of the Creed—someone who can analyze, interface with, and potentially manipulate the remnants of the Age of Forging.

### Key Abilities

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **System Analysis** | Identify vulnerabilities in Undying/Jötun-Forged |
| **Data Recovery** | Extract information from corrupted sources |
| **Root Override** | Temporarily disable machine behavior |
| **Echo Filtering** | Reduce Psychic Stress from Forlorn proximity |

---

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"The Grey Scribes haunt the bones of the god-machines, reading the runes that drove them mad. They do not fear the iron tombs—they study them. They do not pray to the sleeping giants—they take notes. Some say they are blessed with the ancestors' wisdom. Others say they are cursed with their blindness. All agree: they know things that should not be known."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Jötun-Reader Creed represents the intellectual continuation of Aesir methodology, constrained by post-Glitch ethical frameworks and practical limitations. Their Scriptoriums function as combined research facilities, educational institutions, and defensive installations. Their approach to Blight phenomena is analytical rather than theological—treating manifestations as system errors to be understood rather than divine interventions to be worshipped or demonic corruptions to be destroyed. This perspective, while productive, carries significant risk of Cognitive Paradox Syndrome exposure."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"FACTION CLASSIFICATION: Jötun-Reader Creed. ORGANIZATIONAL TYPE: Hierarchical monastic order. PRIMARY FUNCTION: Knowledge preservation and recovery. SECONDARY FUNCTION: Blight phenomenon analysis. RISK PROFILE: Moderate (CPS exposure from research activities). STRATEGIC ASSETS: Pre-Glitch data archives, analytical methodology, trained field personnel. STRATEGIC LIABILITIES: Slow decision-making, ethical constraints, conflict with Iron-Bane and God-Sleeper factions."*

## Summary

The Jötun-Readers are the last scientists of a world that has forgotten science.

They are not the strongest faction. They are not the most numerous. They do not have the Iron-Banes' martial ferocity or the God-Sleepers' populist appeal.

But they have something neither of those factions possesses: **a method**.

While the Iron-Banes destroy and the God-Sleepers pray, the Jötun-Readers *document*. They *analyze*. They *preserve*. They treat the Ginnungagap Glitch not as a curse to be endured or a miracle to be worshipped, but as a **problem to be solved**.

Their Great Work may take centuries. It may never be completed. Many of their best minds have been lost to the very knowledge they seek—driven mad by exposure to the Forlorn, corrupted by contact with Blighted artifacts, or simply swallowed by the ruins they explore.

But they persist.

Because somewhere in the error logs of reality's source code, there is an answer. Somewhere in Loki's lost research, there is a counter-rune. Somewhere in the accumulated knowledge of seven centuries of patient, dangerous scholarship, there is a path forward.

They do not know if they will find it.

They only know that someone must look.

And so they read.

And so they document.

And so they remember.

Because the world is not cursed.

It is broken.

And broken things can be fixed.

*If you understand them well enough.*
