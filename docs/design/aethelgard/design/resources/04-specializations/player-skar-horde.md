# The Skar-Horde Aspirant — The Flesh-Forged

> *"Pain is the only truth in a glitching, untrustworthy reality. The flesh is weak. The machine is stronger. The fusion of both—bought with blood and sanity—is strongest of all."*
> — Skar-Horde doctrine

---

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Warrior |
| **Role** | Single-Target Disabler / Armor-Breaker / Trauma-Fueled Brawler |
| **Path Type** | Heretical |
| **Primary Attribute** | MIGHT |
| **Secondary Attribute** | WILL |
| **Resource System** | Stamina + Savagery (0-100 unique resource) |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | Extreme (Core heretical class; power bought with sanity) |

The **Skar-Horde Aspirant** is the Warrior specialization that embodies the heretical philosophy of achieving power through savage, willful self-mutilation.

They are brutal pragmatists who have embraced the horrific necessities of the Age of Echoes, **ritualistically replacing their hand with a modular, brutalizing weapon-stump**. Their power is not a gift or a curse; it is a choice, a testament to a will so strong it would rather carve away its own flesh than accept the weakness of an unmodified form.

To choose the Aspirant is to embrace the fantasy of the post-apocalyptic gladiatorial warrior and the master of brutal augmentation. Your saga is written in the steel of your own arm and the horrific wounds you inflict. You are not a hero; you are a monument to survival at any cost, a **terrifying fusion of flesh and broken machine**.

## Core Philosophy: The Will to Power

### The Doctrine of Pain

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Pain is Truth** | In a glitching world, suffering is the only undeniable reality |
| **Flesh is Weak** | The unmodified body is a limitation to be overcome |
| **Power Has a Price** | Sanity is an acceptable cost for strength |

In a world where the Runic Blight inflicts a constant, maddening psychic scream, the Skar-Horde have not sought to block it out—they have **embraced it**. Their grim philosophy posits that pain is the only truth in a glitching, untrustworthy reality.

> *"The world lies. Reality stutters and glitches. Memories corrupt. But pain? Pain is honest. When I cut away my hand and fused this weapon-stump to the stump, the agony was absolute. Undeniable. Real. The Blight screams into my mind, and I scream back. I have learned that the scream can be channeled. That madness can be weaponized. That the price of power is always fair—if you're willing to pay."*

The Skar-Horde Aspirant is an outsider who, through desperation or conviction, chooses this path of self-inflicted agony. Their augments are not just weapons; they are **crude antennas for the Great Silence**, turning their very being into a resonant amplifier for the world's pain.

### The Heretical Path

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Source** | Self-mutilation; pain-to-power conversion; Trauma Economy exploitation |
| **Method** | Build Savagery → Spend on devastating attacks → Accumulate Stress |
| **Cost** | Extreme (constant Psychic Stress accumulation; sanity as fuel) |
| **Philosophy** | Power is worth any price—even humanity |

The Skar-Horde Aspirant is a **core heretical class**. Their power is intrinsically linked to their fracturing sanity. The deeper they delve into their specialization, the more their own sanity fractures, creating a dangerous feedback loop where gaining power inflicts Psychic Stress.

> *"The coherent fighters think they're better than us. They keep their minds clean, their bodies whole. They're weak. They've never felt the rush of Savagery flooding through augmented limbs. They've never known the clarity that comes when you've traded your sanity for the certainty of steel. I am not human anymore. I am a weapon. And weapons don't need sanity—they need sharpness."*

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Post-apocalyptic augmented gladiator; self-mutilated monster; the one who pays any price |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Build Savagery → Spend on armor-bypassing attacks → Race against mental collapse |
| **Success Metric** | High-Soak targets dismantled; armor bypassed; boss HP deleted |
| **Decision Space** | When to commit Savagery; which augment to equip; how much Stress can you afford |

Playing a Skar-Horde Aspirant is about **high-risk, high-reward single-target destruction**.

Your gameplay loop is:
1. **Build**: Generate Savagery by hitting enemies and taking damage
2. **Spend**: Unleash devastating armor-bypassing attacks that ignore all defenses
3. **Endure**: Manage the Psychic Stress that accumulates with every surge of power
4. **Transform**: When victory is close, trigger Monstrous Apotheosis for god-tier damage at catastrophic mental cost

> *"One turn, I wade into melee and Savage Strike the armored boss. I take a hit—and Pain Fuels Savagery converts that damage into more fuel. The next turn, I spend my Savagery on Grievous Wound—the attack that bypasses all armor, that makes the boss bleed regardless of how thick its plating is. The Skjaldmær's attacks bounce off. Mine don't. But every time I generate Savagery, I also generate Stress. I'm racing against my own sanity. And I always win. Because winning is the only thing that matters."*

You are the party's **elite tank-buster**—the specialist who dismantles heavily armored single targets through sustained, armor-bypassing damage-over-time effects.

### The Trade-Off

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Single-target damage: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | AoE damage: ⭐ (none) |
| Armor bypass: unparalleled | Survivability: ⭐⭐ (glass cannon) |
| Crowd control: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Party support: ⭐ (self-focused) |

The Skar-Horde Aspirant has **unmatched armor-piercing damage** through Grievous Wound. But this power comes at a terrible cost: constant Stress accumulation that requires dedicated mental health support from the party.

> *"The Bone-Setter keeps me sane. The Skjaldmær keeps me alive. I keep the boss dead. It's a fair trade. Without them, I'd shatter in three fights. With them, I'm unstoppable. The Aspirant doesn't work alone. The Aspirant is a weapon—and weapons need someone to wield them."*

## Core Mechanics: The Three Pillars

### Pillar 1: Savagery (Unique Resource)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Range** | 0-100 |
| **Generation** | Savage Strike hits (+15-25), taking damage (Pain Fuels Savagery), causing Fear (+5) |
| **Decay** | Slow out-of-combat (-10/minute); resets to 0 on rest |
| **Spending** | Required for Tier 2+ abilities |

**Savagery** is the unique resource representing the Aspirant's deepening communion with their monstrous, transhuman nature.

| Source | Savagery Gained |
|--------|-----------------|
| Savage Strike hit | +15-25 (by rank) |
| Taking damage | 10-20% of damage taken (Pain Fuels Savagery) |
| Causing Fear | +5 |
| Kill | Varies by ability |

> *"Savagery is not rage. Rage is hot and chaotic. Savagery is cold and focused. It builds with every blow I land, every blow I take. It pools in my augmented limbs like pressurized hydraulic fluid. And when I spend it—when I unleash a Grievous Wound or an Overcharged Piston Slam—the release is absolute. The target doesn't die from damage. The target dies from inevitability."*

### Pillar 2: Weapon-Stump Augmentation

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Permanently replaces Main Hand weapon slot with modular \[Augmentation\] slot |
| **Effect** | Can never equip standard weapons again; power comes from crafted augments |
| **Customization** | Swap augments at Workbenches to change damage types and ability access |

The Aspirant's Main Hand weapon slot is **permanently replaced** by a modular \[Augmentation\] slot. This is not a temporary buff—it is a permanent sacrifice.

| Augment Type | Damage Type | Enables | Special |
|--------------|-------------|---------|---------|
| \[Serrated Claw\] | Piercing/Slashing | Impaling Spike | +\[Bleeding\] on crits |
| \[Piston Hammer\] | Bludgeoning | Overcharged Piston Slam | \[Armor Piercing\] |
| \[Injector Spike\] | Piercing/Poison | Impaling Spike | +\[Poisoned\] on hit |
| \[Taser Gauntlet\] | Energy | — | +\[Shocked\] on crit |

> *"When I ritualistically severed my hand and fused the weapon-stump to the bleeding stump, I made a choice that can never be undone. I will never hold a sword again. I will never feel the weight of a shield's grip. But I can swap augments at any Workbench—Serrated Claw for piercing and bleeding, Piston Hammer for crushing blows and stuns. I am no longer limited by what weapons I can find. I AM the weapon. And I can be customized."*

### Pillar 3: The Trauma Economy Interface

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Power generation directly inflicts Psychic Stress |
| **Mechanism** | The Price of Power: 1 Stress per 15 Savagery generated |
| **Feedback Loop** | More aggressive play → More Savagery → More Stress |
| **Ultimate Cost** | Monstrous Apotheosis inflicts 20-30 Stress at transformation end |

The Aspirant is a **core heretical class**. Their power is intrinsically linked to their fracturing sanity.

| Trigger | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Gain Savagery | Also gain Psychic Stress (via The Price of Power) |
| Take damage | Gain Savagery (via Pain Fuels Savagery) → Gain Stress |
| End Monstrous Apotheosis | +20-30 Psychic Stress (massive backlash) |

> *"The Price of Power is not a metaphor. It is a mechanical truth. Every time Savagery floods my augmented limbs, I feel my mind crack a little more. The Bone-Setter watches my eyes for the telltale signs—the thousand-yard stare, the involuntary twitching, the muttered responses to voices that aren't there. They keep me functional. Without them, I'd reach Breaking Point in two encounters. With them, I can fight all day. But every fight brings me closer to the edge. And sometimes—sometimes the edge is exactly where I need to be."*

## Abilities: The Doctrine of the Skar

### Tier 1 — Foundational Mutilation

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Heretical Augmentation** | Passive | — | Unlocks \[Augmentation\] slot; can swap augments; damage scales with augment quality |
| **Savage Strike** | Active | 40 Stamina | 2d\[Augment\] + MIGHT damage; +15-25 Savagery on hit |
| **Horrific Form** | Passive | — | 25-50% chance to inflict \[Feared\] on enemies who hit you in melee |

**Heretical Augmentation** is the gateway—the moment the Aspirant sacrifices their humanity for power.

| Rank | Effect | Special |
|------|--------|---------|
| Rank 1 | Unlocks \[Augmentation\] slot | Can craft and install augments at Workbenches |
| Rank 2 | Swap augments in 1 action (normally 2) | Faster tactical adaptation |
| Rank 3 | +1d damage with all augment attacks | Scaling power |

> *"The ritual is simple but irreversible. You place your hand on the altar. The Flesh-Forgers bring down the cleaver. And as you scream, they fuse the weapon-stump to the bleeding stump with cauterizing irons and crude surgery. When you wake—if you wake—you are no longer human. You are Skar-Horde. You are augmented. You are ready."*

**Savage Strike** is the bread-and-butter attack—the fundamental expression of augmented fury.

| Rank | Damage | Savagery | Special |
|------|--------|----------|---------|
| Rank 1 | 2d\[Augment\] + MIGHT | +15 | Base attack |
| Rank 2 | 2d\[Augment\] + MIGHT | +20 | Cost reduced to 35 Stamina |
| Rank 3 | 2d\[Augment\] + MIGHT | +25 | +\[Bleeding\] on critical hit |

**Horrific Form** is the passive deterrent—the calculated absence of humanity.

| Rank | Fear Chance | Duration |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Rank 1 | 25% | 1 turn |
| Rank 2 | 35% | 1 turn |
| Rank 3 | 50% | 1 turn + -2 attack penalty |

> *"The Aspirant's form is a deliberate violation of the human silhouette. The weapon-stump where a hand should be. The crude surgical scars. The way they move—not quite human anymore, but something that was once human and chose to stop being. Enemies who strike the Aspirant in melee range risk being overwhelmed by the wrongness of what they're hitting."*

### Tier 2 — Advanced Brutality

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Grievous Wound** | Active | 45 Stamina + 30 Savagery | Apply \[Grievous Wound\] DoT that bypasses all Soak for 3-4 turns |
| **Impaling Spike** | Active | 40 Stamina + 25 Savagery | 2-3d10 damage + 75-100% \[Rooted\] (requires \[Piercing\] augment) |
| **Pain Fuels Savagery** | Passive | — | Convert 10-20% of damage taken into Savagery |

**Grievous Wound** is the signature attack—the premier tank-buster in the game.

| Rank | Initial Damage | DoT | Duration | Special |
|------|----------------|-----|----------|---------|
| Rank 2 | 3d8 + MIGHT | 1d10/turn | 3 turns | **Bypasses all Soak** |
| Rank 3 | 4d8 + MIGHT | 1d12/turn | 4 turns | **Bypasses all Soak** |

> *"Grievous Wound is not a clean, martial strike. It is an act of pure, anatomical brutality. The Aspirant doesn't aim for the armor—they aim for the gaps. The joints. The soft tissue. The places where even the heaviest plating cannot protect. The wound doesn't heal cleanly. It festers. It bleeds. And no amount of Soak can stop it, because the damage isn't being done to the armor. It's being done to the meat underneath."*

**Impaling Spike** is the control ability—brutal, domineering lockdown.

| Rank | Damage | Root Chance | Duration | Requirement |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Rank 2 | 2d10 + MIGHT | 75% | 2 turns | \[Piercing\] augment |
| Rank 3 | 3d10 + MIGHT | 100% | 3 turns | \[Piercing\] augment |

**Pain Fuels Savagery** is the masochistic engine—turning damage into fuel.

| Rank | Conversion Rate |
|------|-----------------|
| Rank 2 | 10% of damage taken → Savagery |
| Rank 3 | 20% of damage taken → Savagery |

> *"When the enemy hits me, I don't flinch. I smile. Because every point of damage they deal is fuel for my next attack. The more they hurt me, the stronger I become. This is the heresy of the Skar-Horde: we have learned to feed on our own suffering."*

### Tier 3 — Mastery of Savagery

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Overcharged Piston Slam** | Active | 55 Stamina + 40 Savagery | 6-7d10 damage + 75-100% \[Stunned\] (requires \[Blunt\] augment) |
| **The Price of Power** | Passive | — | +75-100% Savagery generation; +1 Stress per 15 Savagery gained |

**Overcharged Piston Slam** is the devastating finisher—massive damage plus guaranteed stun.

| Rank | Damage | Stun Chance | Special | Requirement |
|------|--------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Rank 2 | 7d10 + MIGHT | 75% | 1 turn \[Stunned\] | \[Blunt\] augment |
| Rank 3 | 7d10 + MIGHT | 100% | Next attack vs stunned target deals double damage | \[Blunt\] augment |

> *"The Aspirant overloads the pneumatic systems in their \[Piston Hammer\] augment, channeling dangerous amounts of pressure into a single, devastating strike. The impact is catastrophic—bones shatter, armor crumples, and the target's nervous system simply shuts down from the shock. The stun is not a side effect. It is the point."*

**The Price of Power** is the heretical truth—power bought with sanity.

| Rank | Savagery Bonus | Stress Cost |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| Rank 2 | +75% Savagery generation | +1 Stress per 15 Savagery |
| Rank 3 | +100% Savagery generation | +1 Stress per 15 Savagery |

> *"This is the intoxicating and corrupting feedback loop of the augmented form. Every surge of Savagery feels good—too good. The power is addictive. The strength is absolute. And the cost is measured in fractured sanity. The Aspirant who trains The Price of Power has accepted the bargain completely: they will trade their mind for their muscle, their soul for their steel. They will become the weapon they always wanted to be. And weapons don't need sanity."*

### Capstone — Monstrous Apotheosis

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Cost** | 20 Stamina + 75 Savagery |
| **Duration** | 3-4 turns |
| **Effect** | Savage Strike costs 0 Stamina; Grievous Wound auto-applies \[Bleeding\]; immune to \[Feared\] and \[Stunned\] |
| **Backlash** | +20-30 Psychic Stress when transformation ends |

The capstone **Monstrous Apotheosis** is the final, willing transgression—the moment the Aspirant surrenders completely to their augmented fury.

| Rank | Duration | Backlash | Special |
|------|----------|----------|---------|
| Rank 1 | 3 turns | +30 Stress | Base transformation |
| Rank 2 | 4 turns | +25 Stress | Reduced backlash |
| Rank 3 | 4 turns | +20 Stress | Can exit early to avoid backlash |

> *"The Aspirant triggers Monstrous Apotheosis and ceases to be human entirely. For four devastating turns, they are an avatar of augmented violence—Savage Strikes cost nothing, Grievous Wounds bleed automatically, and no fear or stun can touch them. They are unstoppable. They are terrifying. They are exactly what they always wanted to be. And when the transformation ends, the psychic backlash hits like a hammer. +20 Stress. Enough to push a fragile mind to Breaking Point. The Bone-Setter better be ready."*

## Systemic Integration

### The Heretical Warrior

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Primary Function** | Single-target armor bypass; elite tank-busting; high-risk burst damage |
| **Power Source** | Self-mutilation; pain-to-power conversion; Trauma Economy exploitation |
| **Unique Contribution** | Only Warrior with armor-bypassing DoT; unmatched anti-tank capability |

The Skar-Horde Aspirant is the **darkest** Warrior specialization—the heretical path that proves the Trauma Economy can be exploited, but at terrible cost.

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Heretical (Extreme Trauma risk) |
| **Corruption Sources** | None (Stress-based, not Corruption-based) |
| **Psychic Stress Sources** | The Price of Power (+1 per 15 Savagery); Monstrous Apotheosis (+20-30 backlash) |
| **Player Experience** | Racing against mental collapse; power bought with sanity |

The Skar-Horde Aspirant is the party's **Trauma Economy risk**:
- Constant Stress accumulation through The Price of Power
- Monstrous Apotheosis can instantly shatter sanity
- Requires dedicated Bone-Setter or Skald support
- Without mental health management, becomes unplayable

> *"The feedback loop is intentional. Use Savage Strike → Gain Savagery → Gain Stress. Take damage → Gain Savagery → Gain Stress. The more aggressive you play, the more powerful you become—and the closer you get to Breaking Point. This creates a 'soft enrage' where the Aspirant is most powerful right before their mind shatters. Time your Apotheosis for the boss's final phase. Delete them. Then let the Bone-Setter pick up the pieces."*

### Situational Power Profile

| Condition | Effectiveness |
|-----------|---------------|
| **God-Tier** | Single high-Soak target; extended single-target fights; party has Bone-Setter; Workbench access for augment swapping |
| **Standard** | Mixed encounters with one priority target |
| **Suboptimal** | Multiple spread targets; quick burst required; no mental health support; flying/ranged enemies kiting |

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Bone-Setter** | ESSENTIAL — Cognitive Realignment manages Stress accumulation |
| **Skald** | Sagas provide mental stability and damage buffs |
| **Skjaldmær** | Tank holds aggro while you build Savagery safely |
| **Controllers** | Root/Stun enemies so you can safely melee |
| **Scrap-Tinker** | Crafts superior \[Optimized\] augments |

**Negative Synergies:**

| Ally | Issue |
|------|-------|
| **Other heretical specs** | Double Stress accumulation overwhelms mental health resources |
| **Ranged-only party** | Aspirant alone in melee without support |
| **Burst-focused party** | Grievous Wound's DoT doesn't contribute to burst windows |

> *"The Bone-Setter is not optional. The Bone-Setter is the difference between a weapon and a liability. Without them, I shatter in two encounters. With them, I am the party's answer to every heavily armored threat in the game. The Undying Juggernaut with 30 Soak? Grievous Wound doesn't care. The enemy Skjaldmær? Grievous Wound doesn't care. Armor is irrelevant. I am the tank-buster."*

### Counter-Matchups

| Threat | Response |
|--------|----------|
| **High-Soak tanks** | Grievous Wound bypasses all armor |
| **Fleeing enemies** | Impaling Spike roots them in place |
| **Elite bosses** | Overcharged Piston Slam guaranteed Stun |
| **Mental attacks** | Apotheosis grants Fear/Stun immunity |

---

## Lore Integration

### The Skar-Horde

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Philosophy** | Pain is truth; flesh is weak; power is worth any price |
| **Ritual** | Severing the hand; fusing the weapon-stump; embracing the scream |
| **Function** | Transform pain into power; exploit the Trauma Economy |
| **Status** | Feared and reviled; respected for their terrible effectiveness |

The Skar-Horde are a faction who have embraced the Runic Blight's psychic scream rather than fighting it. They believe that pain is the only truth in a glitching, untrustworthy reality—and that the scream can be channeled into power.

> *"The Skar-Horde don't recruit. They accept. You come to them when you've lost everything else—when the only thing left is the will to survive at any cost. The ritual is brutal and irreversible. You place your hand on the altar. The Flesh-Forgers bring down the cleaver. And when you wake, you are no longer human. You are Skar-Horde. You are augmented. You have traded your humanity for power. And you will never, ever go back."*

### The Augmentation Philosophy

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Source** | Pre-Blight industrial technology; crude surgery; willful self-mutilation |
| **Function** | Replace weak flesh with powerful machine |
| **Limitation** | Requires constant mental health support; races against sanity collapse |
| **Application** | Weapon-stumps, neural interfaces, sensory enhancements |

The Skar-Horde Aspirant's power is not magic—it is **technology fused with flesh** through brutal, irreversible surgery.

> *"My weapon-stump is not enchanted. It is pneumatic. Hydraulic. Mechanical. The power comes from pressurized systems, not mystical runes. But the interface—the way my nervous system connects to the machinery—that required the surgery. That required the pain. The Flesh-Forgers cut open my arm and wired the stump directly to my neural pathways. Now when I think 'strike,' the piston fires. When I think 'grip,' the claws close. The machine is part of me. And I am part of the machine."*

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Skar-Horde** | Core member; the path chosen |
| **Iron-Banes** | Theological enemies; "heretics who embrace corruption" |
| **Jötun-Readers** | Clinical interest; "fascinating case study in human adaptation" |
| **Grove-Clans** | Horror; "they have abandoned the natural order" |
| **General Population** | Fear; "the ones who cut themselves apart for power" |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the Age of Echoes, when the Runic Blight's psychic scream crushes minds and frays sanity, the Skar-Horde have found a different path. They do not block out the scream—they embrace it. They do not flee from pain—they feast on it. They are the Flesh-Forged, warriors who have ritualistically severed their own hands and fused weapon-stumps to the bleeding stumps, trading humanity for devastating combat prowess. The Skar-Horde Aspirant is one who has chosen this path—through desperation or conviction, they have placed their hand on the altar and accepted the cleaver. They are no longer human. They are augmented. Their weapon-stump is a modular tool of destruction, swappable at any Workbench for different damage types and abilities. Their Savagery builds with every blow they land and every blow they take, fueling devastating attacks that bypass all armor. Their Grievous Wounds care nothing for Soak—they tear directly into flesh, regardless of how thick the plating. But power has a price. Every surge of Savagery fractures their sanity a little more. Every fight brings them closer to Breaking Point. They are weapons racing against their own mental collapse, monsters who have traded their minds for their muscle. Their saga is a gruesome chronicle of self-mutilation, a deliberate descent into madness in search of the only truth the Skar-Horde acknowledge: pain. Flesh is weak. The machine is stronger. The fusion of both—bought with blood and sanity—is strongest of all."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Skar-Horde Aspirant (Augmented Brawler) represents the heretical Warrior specialization optimized for single-target armor-bypass damage through self-mutilation and Trauma Economy exploitation. Mechanical role: elite tank-buster and high-risk melee DPS. Core mechanics: Savagery resource (0-100 bar built via dealing/taking damage), Weapon-Stump Augmentation (modular weapon slot with swappable damage types), and Trauma Economy Interface (power generation directly inflicts Psychic Stress via The Price of Power). Key differentiator: only Warrior with armor-bypassing DoT (Grievous Wound); unmatched anti-tank capability; highest single-target damage at extreme mental cost. Signature ability: Monstrous Apotheosis (3-4 turn transformation with free attacks, auto-bleeding, Fear/Stun immunity; +20-30 Stress backlash). Trauma Economy integration: Extreme risk; The Price of Power generates constant Stress; Apotheosis can instantly shatter sanity; requires dedicated Bone-Setter support. Social function: heretical pragmatist who has embraced self-mutilation as a path to power. Optimal deployment: heavily armored single targets; boss fights with high Soak; parties with dedicated mental health support."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Skar-Horde Aspirant (Augmented Brawler). ARCHETYPE: Warrior. PATH TYPE: Heretical. ROLE: Single-Target Disabler / Armor-Breaker / Trauma-Fueled Brawler. PRIMARY STAT: MIGHT. SECONDARY STAT: WILL. RESOURCE: Stamina + Savagery (0-100 unique). CORE MECHANICS: Savagery (builder-spender), Weapon-Stump Augmentation (modular damage types), Trauma Economy Interface (Stress per Savagery). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Mutilation): Heretical Augmentation (passive, unlocks \[Augmentation\] slot), Savage Strike (40 Stamina, +15-25 Savagery), Horrific Form (passive, 25-50% Fear on melee attackers). T2 (Advanced Brutality): Grievous Wound (45 Stamina + 30 Savagery, DoT bypasses all Soak), Impaling Spike (40 Stamina + 25 Savagery, 75-100% \[Rooted\], requires \[Piercing\]), Pain Fuels Savagery (passive, 10-20% damage → Savagery). T3 (Mastery): Overcharged Piston Slam (55 Stamina + 40 Savagery, 6-7d10 + 75-100% \[Stunned\], requires \[Blunt\]), The Price of Power (passive, +75-100% Savagery gen, +1 Stress per 15 Savagery). CAPSTONE: Monstrous Apotheosis (20 Stamina + 75 Savagery, 3-4 turn transform, free Strikes, auto-Bleeding, Fear/Stun immune, +20-30 Stress backlash). TRAUMA ECONOMY: Extreme risk; heretical path; constant Stress accumulation; requires Bone-Setter support."*

## Summary

The Skar-Horde Aspirant is the **flesh-forged**.

They are heretical warriors who have ritualistically severed their own hands and fused weapon-stumps to the bleeding stumps, trading humanity for devastating combat prowess. Their Savagery builds through violence—both dealing and receiving—and fuels attacks that bypass all armor, making them the ultimate tank-busters.

Their gameplay is a high-risk, high-reward race against mental collapse: build Savagery, spend it on armor-bypassing attacks, and manage the constant Stress accumulation that comes with every surge of power. They have unmatched single-target damage against heavily armored enemies, but require dedicated mental health support to remain functional.

This creates a unique niche: the **heretical armor-breaker** who proves that power can be bought with sanity. Where coherent Warriors respect their limits, the Skar-Horde Aspirant has none—they have traded their humanity for their muscle, their mind for their might.

The capstone Monstrous Apotheosis represents the ultimate expression of this philosophy—the moment when the Aspirant surrenders completely to their augmented fury, becoming an avatar of unstoppable violence for four devastating turns before the psychic backlash shatters whatever sanity remains.

This is not heroism. This is survival at any cost.
Pain is truth. Flesh is weak.
Power is worth any price—even humanity.

*You are no longer human.
You are a weapon.
And weapons don't need sanity.*
