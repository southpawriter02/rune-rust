# Hafgufa's Brood

> *"The oceans of Aethelgard are a graveyard, littered with the wreckage of two ages. Patrolling these dark waters are the living tombstones of that failure. They are the undisputed masters of the coastlines, colossal bio-engineered leviathans whose original purpose as guardians has devolved into a primal, territorial fury. To the Skalds, they are the Old Ones of the Fjords. To the Vanir who created them, they were the ultimate coastal defense system. To you? They are the reason you walk."*

## 1. Overview

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Category** | Megafauna (Bio-Metallic Leviathan) |
| **Threat Tier** | Boss / Environmental Hazard |
| **Origin** | Vanir Bio-Engineered / Network-Corrupted |
| **Habitat** | Serpent Fjords, Continental Shelf Channels, Coastal Waters |
| **Behavior** | Territorial Sovereign / Taint-Purger |
| **Pack Size** | Solitary (one adult per fjord); calves shadow in protected coves |

---

## 2. Lineage & Origin (Domain 5 Compliance)

### 2.1 Pre-Glitch Baseline

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Baseline Species** | Jörmungandr-Class Leviathan Platform (Project Jörmungandr) |
| **Original Function** | Submersible guardians for defense and maintenance of Yggdrasil Network's submerged infrastructure; Deep Song bio-sonar for comms, sensing, and structural health monitoring |
| **Era of Creation** | Age of Forging — bio-engineered by Vanir on the Vanaheim Deck; coordinated network deployment across oceanic territories |

### 2.2 Mutation Vector

| Vector | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Primary Cause** | Souring of the Tides — catastrophic Helheim waste reclamation failure flooded oceans with toxins, heavy metals, and raw Aetheric runoff; chemical and Aetheric pollution created painful static in Deep Song network |
| **Visible Mutations** | Bio-metallic armor accretion (patchwork plating from centuries of salvage: Dvergr barges, Baron rigs, Aesir patrol fragments); iron-hard dermal scutes fused with bonding agents; colossal scale (ship-sized) |
| **Behavioral Changes** | Deep Song desynchronization severed network coordination; complex directives collapsed to territorial sovereignty and "taint purge" aggression; obsessive metal acquisition for armor augmentation; isolated rage-state programming |

> **Domain 5 Note:** Hafgufa's Brood is not a natural species but a Vanir bio-engineering marvel corrupted by network severance and environmental contamination. Each leviathan is a living archive of its domain's naval history—the armored plates literally chronicle centuries of territorial conquest. The Scriptorium classifies them as Tier A megafauna with the highest stand-off protocols in the Codex.

## 3. Stat Block

### 3.1 Core Statistics

| Stat | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **HP** | 500+ (segmented pools) | Catastrophic-tier; beyond standard encounter math |
| **Armor** | 12+ (variable by armor accretion) | Bio-metallic plating; older specimens have thicker coverage |
| **Speed** | Submerge 10 / Surface 6 / Ram 12 | Deceptively fast for size; tidal surge precedes movement |
| **Initiative** | +4 | Deep Song detection provides early warning |

### 3.2 Attributes

| Attribute | Value | Modifier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MIGHT** | 24 | +7 |
| **AGILITY** | 10 | +0 |
| **WITS** | 8 | -1 |
| **WILL** | 16 | +3 |
| **PRESENCE** | 20 | +5 |

### 3.3 Defenses

| Defense | Value | Save DC |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Physical** | 22 | DC 22 |
| **Mental** | 14 | DC 14 |
| **Aetheric** | 18 | DC 18 |

### 3.4 Resistances & Vulnerabilities

| Type | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Resistant** | Physical (slashing/piercing) — bio-metallic plating; Cold — oceanic adaptation |
| **Vulnerable** | Lightning — disrupts Deep Song resonance; Sonic — overloads bio-sonar |
| **Immune** | [Corrupted] — environmental saturation; [Feared] — apex territorial confidence |

---

## 4. Abilities

### 4.1 Basic Attack

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | Catastrophic Ram |
| **Type** | Ship-Scale Melee |
| **Range** | Adjacent (vessel-to-vessel) |
| **Damage** | 8d12 + 7 — *Tier: Catastrophic* |
| **Effects** | On hit: Target vessel suffers Hull Breach. DC 18 Pilot check or [Capsizing] begins. Crew takes 4d6 impact damage |

**Resolution:** Roll MIGHT d20 vs vessel Hull Rating

### 4.2 Special Abilities

### Deep Song Detection (Passive)

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Type** | Passive |
| **Trigger** | Any vessel or Iron Heart enters fjord territory |
| **Effect** | Hafgufa detects all vessels within territory regardless of visibility. Automatically tracks movement via bio-sonar. Iron Hearts and Undying vessels trigger [Fixated] (priority targeting) |
| **Cooldown** | None |

> **Aetheric Grounding (Domain 3):** The low-frequency bio-sonar network, though corrupted into static-filled isolation, retains core detection capabilities. The creature "hears" through water with terrifying precision—movement, metal content, and Aetheric signatures all register as distinct "scents" in the Deep Song.
> 

### Taint Purge Aggression (Passive)

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Type** | Passive |
| **Trigger** | Iron Heart, Undying, or significant Aetheric leakage detected |
| **Effect** | Hafgufa ignores all other targets to pursue "tainted" vessel with +4 to attack rolls. Will not disengage until taint source destroyed or removed from territory. Rage persists for 1d4 hours after taint elimination |
| **Cooldown** | None |

> **Aetheric Grounding (Domain 3):** The ancient programming to protect network integrity has corrupted into violent instinctual hatred. The constant Aetheric and chemical leakage from an Iron Heart is a concentrated source of the pollution that disrupts the Deep Song—a poison that must be purged.
> 

### Tidal Surge (Active)

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Type** | Active |
| **Trigger** | Standard action; 3-round cooldown |
| **Effect** | Hafgufa generates localized surge wave. All vessels within 3 zones must pass DC 16 Pilot check or suffer 2d6 damage and [Heeling] (12° or greater). Vessels pushed toward hazardous terrain (sea-wall teeth, ruin teeth, shallow reefs). Surge precedes surfacing by 6-18 seconds |
| **Cooldown** | 3 rounds |

> **Aetheric Grounding (Domain 3):** The creature's mass displacement creates predictable but devastating tidal anomalies. Experienced sailors read these surges as warning signs—"sudden surge without wind means leviathan approach within minutes."
> 

### Armor Plate Shear (Reaction)

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Type** | Reaction |
| **Trigger** | Hafgufa takes 50+ damage from single attack |
| **Effect** | Loosened armor plates shear off as shrapnel. All creatures/vessels within 2 zones take 3d8 Physical damage (DC 14 AGILITY save for half). Hafgufa loses 1 Armor until it integrates new salvage |
| **Cooldown** | Once per combat |

### Undertow Draw (Active)

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Type** | Active |
| **Trigger** | Standard action; 4-round cooldown |
| **Effect** | Hafgufa dives rapidly, creating suction vortex. All vessels within 2 zones must pass DC 18 Pilot check or be pulled 1 zone toward dive point. Vessels pulled into dive point suffer Catastrophic Ram automatically |
| **Cooldown** | 4 rounds |

### 4.3 Signature Ability (Calf-Distress Response)

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | Convergence Howl |
| **Type** | Major action / Triggered |
| **Trigger** | Calf-distress acoustics detected (natural or synthetic); Hafgufa reduced to 25% HP |
| **Effect** | All Hafgufa adults within 3 fjords begin converging on location. First additional adult arrives in 2d6 rounds; each subsequent adult arrives 1d4 rounds later. Convergence creates overlapping territorial rage—multiple leviathans attack anything that moves. Synthetic calf calls trigger immediate convergence with +2 attack bonus ("vendetta response") |
| **Limitations** | Cannot be prevented; multi-leviathan convergence is extinction-level event for vessels |

```

### 5.2 Tactical Notes

| Situation | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Opening** | Deep Song detection triggers immediately upon territory entry; tidal anomalies (surge/mini-seiche) precede surfacing by 6-18 seconds |
| **Iron Heart Present** | Ignores all other targets; Taint Purge Aggression overrides all other priorities; will pursue until destruction |
| **Tribute Offered** | Learned tolerance toward Fjord-Caller patron vessels; may defend patron ships from other threats |
| **Calf Threatened** | Immediate Convergence Howl; multi-adult response; extinction-level event |
| **Wounded** | Does not flee; fights with increasing fury; low HP triggers Convergence Howl |

### 5.3 Environmental Use

| Element | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| **Terrain** | Herds vessels toward sea-wall ruins, ruin teeth, and shallow hazards using Tidal Surge |
| **Ambush** | Surfaces from below with minimal warning; uses fjord narrows to trap vessels |
| **Territory** | Single-fjord sovereignty; territorial markers are submerged wreckage piles |
| **Deep Water** | Uses Undertow Draw to pull vessels into deeper water for ramming |

## 6. Encounter Design

### 6.1 Recommended Encounters

| Encounter Type | Composition | Challenge |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Transit** | 1 Hafgufa (passive if tribute paid) | Low (with Fjord-Caller guide) |
| **Incursion** | 1 Hafgufa (aggressive; no tribute) | Extreme |
| **Taint Pursuit** | 1 Hafgufa (Iron Heart cargo aboard) | Catastrophic |
| **Convergence** | 2-3 Hafgufa (calf-distress triggered) | Extinction |

### 6.2 Synergies

| Paired With | Synergy Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Fjord Terrain** | Narrow channels limit evasion; sea-wall reflections amplify Deep Song |
| **Barnacle-Maw Fields** | Static hazards combine with mobile leviathan threat |
| **Toxic Kelp Forests** | Kelp neurotoxins disable crew; Hafgufa finishes immobilized vessels |
| **Brine-Hags** | Kelp-dwelling semi-sentients distract crew while Hafgufa approaches |

### 6.3 Counter-Play

| Method | Effectiveness |
| --- | --- |
| **Fjord-Caller Tribute** | Metal offerings (200-400 silver value/lunar cycle) purchase safe passage and passive protection |
| **Multi-Decoy Metal Drops** | Jettisoned metal clusters vector Hafgufa away from convoy |
| **Vibration Discipline** | Avoid right-angle wall reflections; hug anti-resonant walls |
| **Slackwater Timing** | Transit during minimal tidal activity reduces detection |
| **Iron Heart Shrouding** | Sealed, shrouded Iron Hearts reduce Aetheric leakage; still risky |
| **Overland Routing** | Avoid maritime transit entirely; costly but guaranteed survival |

## 9. Voice Guidance

### 9.1 Description Templates (Narrator Voice)

**First Warning (Surge):**

> "The water rises wrong. Not a wave—waves have rhythm, reason. This is the sea itself lifting, surging without wind, without storm. Your hull groans as the swell passes beneath you, and in its wake, the fjord falls silent. No gulls. No fish breaking surface. Just the slow, grinding harmonic of metal scraping against metal, somewhere below, coming closer."
> 

**Surfacing:**

> "It breaches like a cathedral rising from the deep. First the armored ridge of its spine—a patchwork of rust and ruin, welded into living hide. Then the head, if you can call it that: a mass of barnacle-encrusted plating where eyes should be, and a jaw that could swallow your vessel whole. Water cascades from its bulk in sheets. The Deep Song hums through your bones. It has always known you were here."
> 

**Attack (Ram):**

> "The impact is not sound. Sound is too small a word. The world becomes force—the shriek of timber splintering, the scream of metal tearing, the roar of displaced water crashing over the deck. Your vessel heaves sideways, spilling crew and cargo into the churning foam. And through the chaos, you see it circling, patient as a glacier, already selecting the next point of impact."
> 

**Tribute Acceptance:**

> "The barge drifts into the mist, piled high with rusted scrap and salvaged plating. For a long moment, nothing. Then the water darkens beneath it, and you see the shape rising—vast, slow, inevitable. The serpent does not surface. It simply... takes. The barge shudders, tilts, and descends, drawn down by something you cannot see. When the water stills, the tribute is gone. And the fjord opens before you, safe passage purchased in iron and silence."
>

## 11. Phased Implementation Guide

### Phase 1: Data & Persistence

- [ ]  **Define Entity**: Create `EnemyType` entity for Hafgufa's Brood with boss-tier stats, behavior flags, and megafauna category.
- [ ]  **Seed Data**: Add Hafgufa Adult (Boss), Elder (Ancient), Calf (Juvenile), Tributary (Patron), and Sour-Maddened (Unstable) to `EnemyTypes` table.
- [ ]  **Validation**: Verify `Threat Tier` = Boss, `Category` = Megafauna matches Domain rules.

### Phase 2: Core Logic

- [ ]  **Stat Block**: Implement `HafgufaStats` value object with HP 500+, Armor 12+, Speed 10.
- [ ]  **Abilities**: Implement `IAbility` strategy classes:
    - `CatastrophicRamAbility` (ship-scale basic attack)
    - `DeepSongDetectionAbility` (passive territory detection)
    - `TaintPurgeAggressionAbility` (passive Iron Heart priority)
    - `TidalSurgeAbility` (active forced movement)
    - `ArmorPlateShearAbility` (reaction shrapnel)
    - `UndertowDrawAbility` (active suction pull)
    - `ConvergenceHowlAbility` (signature multi-adult summon)
- [ ]  **AI State Machine**: Define states in `HafgufaAI.cs`:
    - `Patrol` → `Detect` (on vessel entry)
    - `Detect` → `Purge` (Iron Heart) or `Assess` (metal content) or `Track` (wood only)
    - `Purge` → `Pursue` → `Ram` (relentless until taint destroyed)
    - `Tribute` → `Tolerate` → `Defend` (patron vessels threatened)
- [ ]  **Unit Tests**: Verify Taint Purge priority; test Convergence Howl trigger; test tribute tolerance.

### Phase 3: Systems Integration

- [ ]  **Spawn Rules**: Add to `EncounterTable` for Serpent Fjords, coastal channels, fjord territories.
- [ ]  **Maritime Engine**: Register `HafgufaAI` with `NavalCombatService`; implement ship-scale damage resolution.
- [ ]  **Loot**: Connect `HafgufaDropTable` to `SalvageService`; implement armor chronicle historical data.

### Phase 4: UI & Feedback

- [ ]  **Logs**: Detailed AI decision logs (Deep Song detection, Taint Purge triggers, Convergence coordination).
- [ ]  **TUI**: "The water rises wrong..." environmental notification; surge warning; ram impact description.
- [ ]  **GUI**: Assign model/sprite; implement surge wave effect; armor plating texture variation; Deep Song visual distortion.

## 15. Changelog

| Version | Date | Changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0 | 2025-12-29 | Initial specification; synthesized from v2.0, v4.0 sources |

---

This specification is ready for review. Hafgufa's Brood is designed as an environmental/boss-tier megafauna threat that fundamentally shapes Aethelgard's maritime landscape—the single greatest reason the world is a land-based society. The creature emphasizes territory, tribute, and the brutal economics of survival at sea. It synergizes with fjord terrain and rewards parties that respect Fjord-Caller protocols while presenting extinction-level consequences for those who carry Iron Hearts or trigger Convergence events. The "Taint Purge" mechanic creates unique gameplay tension around Undying cargo, while the tribute system provides non-combat interaction paths.
