## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Forlorn Whisper is the Seiðkona's **spirit communication ability**—the power to speak directly with the Forlorn and request their assistance. This elevates them from passive observer to active mediator between the living and the dead.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Communicate with detected Forlorn spirits
- **Secondary:** Request information, guidance, or minor intervention
- **Self-Cost:** Moderate Psychic Stress (communing with the dead strains the mind)
- **Fantasy Delivery:** Speaking the language of the lost

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High utility (spirits know things the living don't)
- **Forlorn Dependent:** Requires Forlorn to be present
- **Spirit Disposition:** Not all Forlorn are helpful; some are hostile
- **Psychic Cost:** Prevents casual use

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Seiðkona speaks into the silence—not with their voice, but with their *mind*. The words are not words at all, but impressions: sorrow, recognition, respect. The language of the Forlorn is the language of the broken, and the Seiðkona has learned to speak it fluently.

The spirit responds. Sometimes with words, sometimes with images, sometimes with feelings so intense they bring the Seiðkona to their knees. The dead remember everything, and sharing those memories is rarely pleasant.

But information is power, and the dead know secrets the living have forgotten.

### Thematic Resonance

Forlorn Whisper is the Seiðkona as psychopomp—the intermediary who walks between worlds, giving voice to those who have none and receiving their wisdom in return.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Activation

- **Action Type:** Standard Action (or 5 minutes outside combat)
- **Cost:** 40 AP + **Moderate Psychic Stress** (8-12)
- **Range:** 10 meters
- **Target:** Single Forlorn spirit detected by Spiritual Attunement

### Effect

**Establish psychic communication with target Forlorn:**

| Request Type | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Information | Spirit shares knowledge of area, events, people |
| Guidance | Spirit indicates direction to objective or danger |
| Warning | Spirit alerts to incoming threat (grants +2 Initiative) |
| Minor Aid | Spirit briefly manifests to distract enemy (1 round [Distracted]) |

### Spirit Disposition

- **Friendly:** Grants request freely; may offer additional help
- **Neutral:** Grants request but requires small offering (AP, item, promise)
- **Hostile:** Refuses; may attack Seiðkona psychically

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Spirit Detection:** Confirm Forlorn present via Spiritual Attunement
2. **Cost Payment:** Spend 40 AP; gain Moderate Psychic Stress
3. **Communication Attempt:** Establish psychic link
4. **Disposition Check:** GM determines spirit's attitude
5. **Request Resolution:** Spirit responds based on disposition
