## Core Identity

**Specialization:** Rust-Witch (Agent of Entropy)

**Tier:** 3 (Mastery of Corrosion)

**Type:** Passive

**Prerequisite:** 20 PP in Rust-Witch tree, Corrosive Curse + Flash Rust + 1 Tier 2 ability

**Cost:** 7 PP

## Description

Your understanding of entropy has become absolute. You no longer merely accelerate decay—you make it **inevitable**. Your curses are no longer temporary disruptions that systems can recover from. They are fundamental re-writings of the target's source code. Once you mark something for decay, that decay becomes permanent, irreversible, inexorable.

## Mechanics

### Passive Effect

**All [Corroded] status effects you apply:**

- **No longer have turn duration**
- Last until **end of combat** (permanent)
- Continue dealing damage and reducing armor every turn
- Can still stack up to 5

### The Cost

- Gain **+1 Runic Blight Corruption per turn** while in combat
- Constant, automatic accumulation
- Your decay accelerates alongside your enemies'

### Example Timeline

| Turn | Action | Corruption |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Cast Corrosive Curse | +1 (cast) +1 (passive) = +2 |
| 2 | Enemy takes [Corroded] damage | +1 (passive) |
| 3-10 | [Corroded] continues every turn | +1 per turn |
| **Total** | 10-turn fight | +12 minimum |

---

## Tactical Applications

1. **Long Fight Dominance:** Boss fights become your domain
2. **Single Cast Value:** One Corrosive Curse deals damage for entire fight
3. **Accelerated Entropy Synergy:** Permanent [Corroded] = permanent Aether gen
4. **Point of No Return:** Once you take this, you're committed to high Corruption gameplay

## Risk Assessment

<aside>
⚠️

**Extreme Risk:** In a 10-turn boss fight, you'll gain +10 Corruption minimum just from this passive. Must end fights quickly before your own decay kills you.

## Integration Notes

- **Power Spike:** Transforms you into sustained damage monster
- **Race Against Time:** More damage, but accelerating your own Corruption
- **Use Return to Dust:** Your finisher to end fights before Corruption kills you
