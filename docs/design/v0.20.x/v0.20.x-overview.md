# v0.20.x Feature Overview: Aethelgard Specialization Implementation

## Executive Summary

v0.20.x implements the **Aethelgard Specialization System** — replacing any existing generic character classes with setting-specific specializations. This version builds upon the Archetype System (v0.17.3) and Specialization Framework (v0.17.4) by implementing the full ability trees for each specialization. Each specialization receives its own sub-version with abilities implemented across multiple sub-parts.

The specializations embody the Norse-cyberpunk aesthetic of Aethelgard, offering unique mechanical identities tied to the world's lore, factions, and survival challenges.

## Design Philosophy

### Specializations vs Generic Classes

| Aspect | Generic Classes | Aethelgard Specializations |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Identity | Fantasy archetypes (Rogue, Mage) | Norse-cyberpunk hybrids |
| Mechanics | Standard RPG abilities | Setting-integrated systems |
| Lore | Generic fantasy | World-Machine survivors |
| Resources | Mana/Energy | Rage, Echoes, Block Charges |
| Progression | Linear | Tiered with PP investment |

### Why This Matters

1. **Setting Coherence**: Abilities reference Aethelgard lore (Glitch, Aether, Blight)
2. **Mechanical Identity**: Each specialization plays distinctly differently
3. **Player Investment**: PP-based unlocking creates meaningful choices
4. **Archetype Foundation**: Specializations extend archetype capabilities

---

## Legacy Class Removal (v0.20.0)

### Classes to Remove

Any placeholder or generic class implementations that exist in the codebase:

| Legacy Class | Replacement | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
| Generic "Rogue" | Myrk-gengr, Strandhögg | Stealth archetypes |
| Generic "Fighter" | Skjaldmær, Berserkr | Combat archetypes |
| Generic "Mage" | Seiðkona | Magic archetype |
| Generic "Healer" | Bone-Setter | Support archetype |
| Generic "Scholar" | Jötun-Reader | Knowledge archetype |
| Generic "Crafter" | Rúnasmiðr, Scrap-Tinker | Crafting archetypes |

### Migration Strategy

```
Migration Path:
1. Identify characters with legacy classes
2. Map legacy class to nearest Aethelgard archetype
3. Offer first specialization selection for free
4. Preserve existing abilities where compatible
5. Refund PP for abilities that cannot migrate
```

---

## Ability Tier Structure

Each specialization follows the standard tier structure from v0.17.4:

| Tier | Abilities | PP Cost (Each) | Tree Prerequisite |
|------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Tier 1** | 3 | 0 (Free) | Unlock specialization |
| **Tier 2** | 3 | 4 PP | 8 PP invested in tree |
| **Tier 3** | 2 | 5 PP | 16 PP invested in tree |
| **Capstone** | 1 | 6 PP | 24 PP invested in tree |

**Total per Specialization:** 9 abilities, up to 35 PP to complete tree
