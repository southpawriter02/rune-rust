# Medium Armor

## Overview

| Property | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Philosophy** | Balanced protection and mobility |
| **Armor Types** | Chain mail, scale mail, ring mail, brigandine (heavy), lamellar |
| **Full Set Soak** | **12 Soak** (Head: 2, Chest: 4, Hands: 2, Legs: 2, Feet: 2) |
| **Penalties** | **-1d10** to Agility-based checks; **+2 Stamina** cost for movement actions |
| **Proficiency** | Warrior, Skirmisher |
| **Best For** | Frontline Skirmishers; balanced Warriors; characters wanting protection without heavy penalties |
| **Common Names** | Ring-Shirt, The Linking Shell, Battle-Ready, Warrior's Standard |

> **Diagnostic Notes:** Medium armor represents the practical choice for combatants who expect to take hits but cannot afford complete mobility sacrifice. The interlocking construction (rings, scales, or plates) distributes impact force across a wider area while maintaining flexibility for combat maneuvers. Midgard Combine Huskarls universally wear medium armor—the protection enables frontline engagement while the mobility permits tactical withdrawal.

## A. Chain Mail (Maille)

| Property | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Examples** | Chain hauberk, mail shirt, mail coif, chain chausses |
| **Soak per Piece** | Head: 2, Chest: 4, Hands: 2, Legs: 2, Feet: 2 |
| **Full Set Soak** | 12 Soak |
| **Penalties** | -1d10 Agility; +2 Stamina for movement |
| **Special Properties** | **[Flexible]** — Reduced penalty to grappling; **[Slash Resistant]** — +2 Soak vs. slashing damage |
| **Proficiency Required** | Medium Armor Proficiency |
| **Common Names** | Ring-Shirt, The Thousand Links, Woven Steel, The Singing Shell |

> **Diagnostic Notes:** Chain mail represents the most common medium armor in Aethelgard—thousands of interlocking metal rings providing excellent protection against slashing weapons while maintaining reasonable flexibility. The construction requires significant metalworking skill; each ring must be individually closed and linked to its neighbors. The characteristic sound of moving chain ("singing") makes stealth difficult but serves as an audible status indicator—damaged mail sounds different from intact mail.

### Example Armor

| Tier | Name (Quality) | Soak (Full Set) | Value (PS) | Special |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | **Jury-Rigged Ring Shirt** (Jury-Rigged) | 10 Soak | 50 PS | Gaps between rings; -1 Defense |
| 1 | **Salvaged Mail Hauberk** (Scavenged) | 12 Soak | 150 PS | [Slash Resistant] |
| 2 | **Clan-Forged Chain Mail** (Clan-Forged) | 13 Soak | 400 PS | [Slash Resistant]; [Flexible]; +1 Defense |
| 3 | **Dvergr Riveted Mail** (Dvergr-Forged) | 15 Soak | 950 PS | [Slash Resistant]; cannot rust; +2 Defense |
| 5 | **Gleipnir-Weave** (Myth-Forged) | 15 Soak | 18,000 PS | [Slash Resistant]; immune to [Entangled]; +3 STURDINESS; attackers take 1d10 damage on successful hit |

## B. Scale Mail

| Property | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Examples** | Scale armor, scale hauberk, scale cuisses, lamellar |
| **Soak per Piece** | Head: 2, Chest: 4, Hands: 2, Legs: 2, Feet: 2 |
| **Full Set Soak** | 12 Soak |
| **Penalties** | -1d10 Agility; +2 Stamina for movement |
| **Special Properties** | **[Overlapping]** — Superior protection from above; +2 Soak vs. downward strikes |
| **Proficiency Required** | Medium Armor Proficiency |
| **Common Names** | Fish-Skin, Dragon-Hide, The Scaled Shell, Serpent's Gift |

> **Diagnostic Notes:** Scale mail employs overlapping metal plates (scales) attached to a backing material, providing excellent protection against downward strikes—the overlap design deflects blows sliding down the body. Construction is faster than chain mail (scales are punched rather than individually formed), making scale armor more accessible to community smiths. The visual aesthetic evokes pre-Glitch imagery of serpents and dragons, lending the armor mythic resonance.

### Example Armor

| Tier | Name (Quality) | Soak (Full Set) | Value (PS) | Special |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | **Scrap-Scale Vest** (Jury-Rigged) | 10 Soak | 45 PS | Scales work loose; requires frequent repair |
| 1 | **Salvaged Scale Armor** (Scavenged) | 12 Soak | 140 PS | [Overlapping] |
| 2 | **Clan-Forged Scale Mail** (Clan-Forged) | 13 Soak | 380 PS | [Overlapping]; +1 Defense vs. ranged |
| 3 | **Dvergr Lamellar** (Dvergr-Forged) | 15 Soak | 900 PS | [Overlapping]; lacquered; +2 vs. acid |
| 5 | **Jörmungandr's Scales** (Myth-Forged) | 15 Soak | 22,000 PS | [Overlapping]; poison immunity; +4 STURDINESS; regenerates 2 HP/round |

## C. Ring Mail & Splint Armor

| Property | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Examples** | Ring mail, splint mail, banded mail, half-plate (transitional) |
| **Soak per Piece** | Head: 2, Chest: 4, Hands: 2, Legs: 2, Feet: 2 |
| **Full Set Soak** | 12 Soak |
| **Penalties** | -1d10 Agility; +2 Stamina for movement |
| **Special Properties** | **[Rigid Support]** — +1 Soak vs. crushing damage; -1 to Acrobatics |
| **Proficiency Required** | Medium Armor Proficiency |
| **Common Names** | Bar-Armor, The Banded Shell, Stripe-Steel, Transitional Plate |

> **Diagnostic Notes:** Ring mail and splint armor represent transitional designs between flexible chain and rigid plate—metal strips or reinforced rings providing enhanced protection at the cost of flexibility. The rigid components distribute impact force effectively (reducing blunt trauma damage) but restrict body movement more than pure chain. Iron-Bane crusaders favor splint armor; the vertical bands evoke imagery of prison bars, symbolically containing the corruption they oppose.

### Example Armor

| Tier | Name (Quality) | Soak (Full Set) | Value (PS) | Special |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | **Scrap-Banded Vest** (Jury-Rigged) | 10 Soak | 55 PS | Bands misaligned; uncomfortable |
| 1 | **Salvaged Splint Mail** (Scavenged) | 12 Soak | 160 PS | [Rigid Support] |
| 2 | **Clan Ring Mail** (Clan-Forged) | 13 Soak | 420 PS | [Rigid Support]; +1 Defense |
| 3 | **Dvergr Banded Armor** (Dvergr-Forged) | 15 Soak | 1,000 PS | [Rigid Support]; +2 Soak vs. crushing |
| 5 | **Iron-Bound Cage** (Myth-Forged) | 15 Soak | 16,500 PS | [Rigid Support]; immune to [Stunned]; +3 vs. Automata; wearer cannot be moved against will |
