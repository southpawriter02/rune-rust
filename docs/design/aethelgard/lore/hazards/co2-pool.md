# Codex Entry: CO₂ Frost Pooling (The Silent Basin)

> *Jötun-Reader Field Notation: The following entry synthesizes five evidence fragments recovered between 778-783 PG. Unlock thresholds defined per Geological Hazard protocol. Atmospheric monitoring equipment mandatory in confirmed territories.*

## 1.0 Overview

**CO₂ Frost Pooling**—known to the Forsaken as *Stillwater Death* and designated "Basin Asphyxia Hazard" in Scriptorium field reports—represents one of Niflheim's most insidious environmental threats. Unlike the realm's visible dangers—crevasse grids, slab avalanches, Borealis Storms—this hazard is invisible, odorless, and silent. It kills without warning in the calm air of glacial basins, particularly around the vent complexes of **Hvergelmir's Maw**.

The phenomenon occurs when dense, cold carbon dioxide accumulates in topographic depressions near cryo-vents. The gas, heavier than breathable air, pools in basins and sump rims where it displaces oxygen. Victims experience no warning—only sudden confusion, collapse, and death. The Forsaken call these zones "still water" because the air sits motionless, undisturbed, as if frozen in place.

## 2.0 Formation Mechanics

CO₂ frost pooling emerges from the interaction of Hvergelmir's corrupted cryo-systems and Niflheim's topography:

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Source** | Vent-surge cycles (period 11-14 min) release CO₂-rich exhalations from subterranean coolant trunks |
| **Accumulation** | Dense gas settles into basins, sump rims, and lee-slope pockets |
| **Concentration Dynamics** | Baseline 1,100 ppm rising to 2,400 ppm peaks at surge+60 seconds |
| **Persistence** | Still-air conditions allow dangerous concentrations to persist for hours between wind events |

---

## 3.0 Detection & Field Tells

Scriptorium field protocols emphasize three primary detection signatures:

| Detection Method | Indicator |
|------------------|-----------|
| **Atmospheric stillness** | Abnormal calm in locations that should experience katabatic flow |
| **Visibility drop** | Faint optical distortion at gas/air interface ("shimmer line") |
| **Instrument confirmation** | CO₂ meter readings at pad height; ABORT if ppm >1,500 |

---

## 4.0 Physiological Effects

Exposure follows a rapid, predictable progression:

| Concentration | Effects | Time to Incapacitation |
|---------------|---------|------------------------|
| 1,500-2,000 ppm | Headache, confusion, impaired judgment | 8-15 minutes |
| 2,000-3,000 ppm | Rapid breathing, dizziness, loss of coordination | 3-5 minutes |
| >3,000 ppm | Unconsciousness, respiratory failure | <2 minutes |

---

## 5.0 Countermeasures & SOPs

Rangers Guild and Scriptorium protocols mandate:

| Protocol | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Altitude discipline** | Stay high on rim; avoid basins, sump rims, and lee-slope pockets |
| **Respiratory protection** | Masks sealed at all times in hazard zones; cadence breathing (slow, measured inhalation) |
| **Monitoring** | CO₂ alarm set at pad height; continuous readings during operations |
| **Ventilation** | Forced air circulation using bellows or fabric fans when basin entry unavoidable |
| **BLACK-FLAG** | Immediate abort if ppm >1,500; masks breach; or double readings in 30 seconds |

---

## Unlock Thresholds — Geological Hazard Protocol

| Threshold | Reveals |
|-----------|---------|
| **20%** | Common name ("Stillwater Death"), general hazard category, Niflheim association |
| **40%** | Basic mechanics (invisible gas pooling in basins), primary danger zone (Hvergelmir's Maw) |
| **60%** | Detection signatures (stillness, shimmer, instrument readings), physiological progression |
| **80%** | Vent-surge cycle timing, concentration dynamics (1,100→2,400 ppm), ppm thresholds |
| **100%** | Full SOP protocols, BLACK-FLAG criteria, countermeasure equipment specifications |

---

> **Lead Researcher's Note:** *The Forsaken have a saying: "The wind is your friend in Niflheim—fear the calm." They learned this the hard way. The first survey teams to reach the Maw Rim lost a third of their number before anyone understood why. The bodies showed no wounds, no frostbite, no sign of struggle. They simply... stopped.*

### Content (L2 Scholarly Voice)

> **On the Nature of Invisible Asphyxiation in Glacial Depressions**
>
> Among the environmental threats documented in Niflheim's frozen expanse, few demonstrate such perfect lethality as the phenomenon we have designated "CO₂ Frost Pooling." The hazard emerges from the interaction of Hvergelmir's corrupted cryo-systems—specifically the vent-surge exhalations—and the realm's characteristic topographic depressions.
>
> Carbon dioxide, being denser than breathable atmosphere, accumulates in basins and sump rims where natural air circulation is impeded. The gas is invisible, odorless, and provides no physiological warning until cognitive impairment has already begun. Field observations across fourteen survey seasons confirm concentration dynamics ranging from baseline 1,100 ppm to peak values exceeding 2,400 ppm within sixty seconds of vent-surge events.
>
> The Forsaken populations have developed empirical awareness of this threat, encoding survival knowledge in their "still water" terminology—a reference to the unnaturally motionless quality of pooled gas zones.

>
> My father's father taught us: 'The wind is your friend in Niflheim—fear the calm.' We didn't understand, not truly. Wind means cold, means the bite, means suffering. How could calm be worse?
>
> Then came the First Survey—the Maw-Seekers, we called them. Scribes from the Grey Tower, all bright eyes and brass instruments. Thirty went up to the Maw Rim. Ten came down. The rest? Found them in the basins, peaceful as sleeping babes. No wounds. No frost-burn. Just... stopped.
>
> The still water doesn't hurt. That's the trick of it. You breathe it in, and it feels like rest. Your legs go soft, your thoughts go soft, and then you sit down to rest a moment. Just a moment. Forever.
>
> We learned. We watch the smoke, the dust, the frost-motes. When they move, we move. When they stop, we run. The Maw breathes poison, outlander. And it breathes slow."
