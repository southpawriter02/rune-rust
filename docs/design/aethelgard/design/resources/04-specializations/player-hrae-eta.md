# The Hræ-eta — The Corpse-Eater

> *"You see the dead and you think: tragedy. You think: loss. I see the dead and I think: opportunity. In a world where the Blight has twisted all life and sustenance is scarce, I have learned the ultimate pragmatism. Every corpse is a resource. Every fallen enemy is a meal. Every meal is power. Yes, it costs me. Every Blighted morsel burns going down, every chunk of corrupted flesh stains my soul a little more. But the power? The power is real. The regeneration flooding my veins, the stolen strength of warriors, the absorbed instincts of beasts—all real. You can keep your purity. I'll keep my survival."*

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Warrior |
| **Role** | Self-Buffing Juggernaut / Heretical Survivalist / Attrition Specialist |
| **Path Type** | Heretical |
| **Primary Attribute** | MIGHT |
| **Secondary Attribute** | WILL |
| **Resource System** | Stamina + Essence Buffs |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | Extreme (constant Corruption accumulation) |

The **Hræ-eta** is the Warrior specialization that embodies the philosophy that **in a system defined by decay, all things are a resource—even the dead**.[^]

They are practitioners of a dark, survivalist tradition that has learned to consume the flesh of their fallen foes, believing that to internalize the world's sickness is to gain power over it. This is not simple cannibalism; it is a heretical act of **brute-force data acquisition**. To eat the flesh of a Blighted beast is to "download" a fragment of its corrupted, primal code.

To choose the Hræ-eta is to embrace the fantasy of the monstrous pragmatist and the terrifying juggernaut. Your saga is a gruesome chronicle of self-corruption, a constant battle to control the monster you are willingly becoming. You trade your humanity piece by piece for overwhelming, visceral power.

## Core Philosophy: The Heretical Bargain

### The Ultimate Pragmatism

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **All Things Are Resources** | The dead are not an end; they are fuel |
| **Internalize to Overcome** | To consume the Blight is to master it |
| **Power Over Purity** | Trade humanity for survival, piece by piece |

The Hræ-eta's philosophy is rooted in a brutal truth about post-Glitch Aethelgard: **if you cannot fight the virus, become the virus**.[^] In a world where the Runic Blight has twisted all life and sustenance is scarce, they have discovered that consuming corrupted flesh grants access to its power.

> *"The others try to stay 'pure.' They avoid Blighted food, Blighted water, Blighted air. And they die. Slowly, yes, but they die. I made a different choice. I stopped fighting the corruption and started eating it. Every Blighted corpse I consume stains my soul—I know this. But every corpse also makes me stronger. Faster. Harder to kill. The others call me a monster. I call myself a survivor."*

Their philosophy is darkly transactional: **the Heretical Bargain** is a constant, conscious exchange of long-term humanity for immediate, overwhelming power.

### The Brute-Force Data Acquisition

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Method** | Consume corpses of fallen organic enemies |
| **Mechanism** | "Download" fragments of creature's primal code |
| **Cost** | Permanent Runic Blight Corruption per Blighted meal |
| **Benefit** | Powerful temporary buffs (Essence Absorption) |

In a world where every living thing is a form of "code," to eat the flesh of a fallen foe is to **download a fragment of its corrupted, primal data directly into one's own system**.[^]

> *"The Jötun-Readers call it 'brute-force data acquisition.' I call it dinner. When I tear into the flesh of a fallen Vargr, I'm not just sating hunger—I'm absorbing its instincts, its regenerative capacity, its predator's code. When I consume a fallen warrior, I steal their martial patterns, their strength, their skill. The data burns going down. But it becomes part of me. And I become more."*[^]

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Monstrous juggernaut who grows stronger by consuming the fallen |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Ramping powerhouse; starts weak, becomes unstoppable |
| **Success Metric** | Corpse management; Essence buff uptime; Corruption vs. power balance |
| **Decision Space** | What to consume; when to consume; how much Corruption to accept |

Playing a Hræ-eta is about **visceral ramping and gruesome resource management**.[^]

Your operational loop is:
1. **Kill**: Generate corpses through combat (preferably with Tenderize for enhanced buffs)
2. **Consume**: Spend a Standard Action to eat a [Beast] or [Humanoid] corpse
3. **Absorb**: Gain powerful [Essence] buff based on creature type
4. **Escalate**: As battlefield fills with corpses, become increasingly monstrous
5. **Transform**: At critical mass, activate Monstrous Apotheosis for devastating power

> *"I often start a fight as an ordinary warrior—dangerous, but manageable. Then the first enemy falls. And I kneel. And I eat. The others watch in horror as I tear into the corpse mid-battle. But they also watch me rise with new power surging through my veins. By the time the third corpse is consumed, I'm not a warrior anymore. I'm an unstoppable force of nature. I'm the monster their mothers warned them about."*

You're not a consistent damage dealer—you're a **ramping juggernaut** who becomes more terrifying with every kill and every meal.

### The Trade-Off

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Massive power scaling through combat | Useless until first corpse generated |
| Multiple buff types for versatility | Hard countered by [Undying] and [Forlorn] |
| Self-sustaining through Essence buffs | Constant, permanent Corruption accumulation |
| Terrifying psychological weapon (Horrifying Feast) | Competing with party for corpse resources |
| Scales with Corruption (One with the Filth) | Social alienation from "coherent" factions |

The Hræ-eta is **devastating in their element** but pays for it with their soul—literally. A late-game Hræ-eta is one of the most powerful combatants in the game, but they're also spiraling toward Terminal Error.[^]

> *"The trade-off is simple: power now, price later. Every Blighted corpse I consume adds to my Corruption. Every Corruption point brings me closer to becoming one of the monsters I fight. But here's the dark secret the others don't understand—the more corrupt I become, the more power I can extract from the Blight. It's a feedback loop. A downward spiral that makes me stronger the deeper I fall. Yes, I'm becoming a monster. But I'm becoming a very, very powerful monster."*

## Core Mechanics: The Three Pillars

### Pillar 1: Corpse Consumption

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Action Type** | Standard Action |
| **Cost** | 20 Stamina |
| **Valid Targets** | [Beast] or [Humanoid] faction corpses |
| **Invalid Targets** | [Undying], [Forlorn] corpses |
| **Result** | Gain [Essence] buff; corpse removed from battlefield |

**Corpse Consumption** is the foundational mechanic—the central, defining combat system of the specialization.[^]

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│          CORPSE CONSUMPTION                 │

├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│                                             │

│  COMMAND: consume [corpse]                  │

│  COST: 20 Stamina + Standard Action         │

│                                             │

│  VALID TARGETS:                             │

│  • [Beast] faction corpses                  │

│  • [Humanoid] faction corpses               │

│                                             │

│  INVALID TARGETS:                           │

│  • [Undying] corpses (mechanical)           │

│  • [Forlorn] corpses (spiritual)            │

│                                             │

│  CORRUPTION COST:                           │

│  • If corpse was [Blighted]: +1 permanent   │

│    Runic Blight Corruption                  │

│                                             │

│  "To consume the Blight is to become        │

│   the Blight."                              │

│                                             │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

> *"The command is simple: consume. I kneel beside the fallen, I tear into the flesh, I swallow. The Blighted meat burns as it goes down—that's the Corruption seeping into my soul. But then the power floods my veins. Savage, primal energy. The instincts and strength of my victim becoming part of me. That's the transaction. That's the bargain. Every single time."*[^]

### Pillar 2: Essence Absorption

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Gain temporary buffs based on creature type consumed |
| **[Essence of Beast]** | [Regeneration] status—heal at start of turn |
| **[Essence of Man]** | +2 MIGHT attribute bonus |
| **Duration** | 3 rounds (5 rounds if corpse was [Tenderized]) |
| **Stacking** | Only one Essence buff active at a time; new consumption overwrites |

**Essence Absorption** is the reward mechanic—the tangible power gained from the heretical act.[^]

| Corpse Type | Essence Buff | Effect |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| **[Beast]** | [Essence of the Beast] | [Regeneration]—heal small amount each turn |
| **[Humanoid]** | [Essence of Man] | +2 MIGHT attribute |
| **[Tenderized]** | (Any) | Duration extended to 5 rounds |
| **[Champion/Elite]** (Tier 3) | Enhanced buffs | Significantly more powerful effects |

> *"The buff I gain depends on what I eat. Consume a beast—a Vargr, a Boar, a Serpent—and I absorb its primal vitality. My wounds close. My flesh knits. The [Essence of the Beast] courses through me like liquid regeneration. Consume a humanoid—a raider, a cultist, a soldier—and I steal their martial prowess. My muscles swell. My strikes hit harder. The [Essence of Man] makes me a more efficient killer."*[^]

### Pillar 3: The Heretical Bargain

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Trading permanent Corruption for temporary power |
| **Base Cost** | +1 Corruption per [Blighted] corpse consumed |
| **Feedback Loop** | One with the Filth makes buffs stronger at higher Corruption |
| **Ultimate Cost** | Monstrous Apotheosis inflicts massive permanent Corruption |

**The Heretical Bargain** is the risk-reward mechanism—the dark pact that defines the specialization.[^]
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐

├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│                                             │

│  THE CORE TRANSACTION:                      │

│  • Every [Blighted] corpse consumed         │

│  • = +1 permanent Runic Blight Corruption   │

│  • This is unavoidable, certain, deliberate │

│                                             │

│  THE FEEDBACK LOOP (One with the Filth):    │

│  • Higher Corruption = stronger Essence     │

│  • Incentivizes embracing the spiral        │

│  • Makes "pure" Hræ-eta weaker              │

│                                             │

│  THE ULTIMATE PRICE (Monstrous Apotheosis): │

│  • Massive permanent Corruption             │

│  • For moments of god-like power            │

│  • The final, irreversible step             │

│                                             │

│  "If you cannot fight the virus,            │

│   become the virus."                        │

│                                             │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

> *"The others think Corruption is a penalty. Something to be avoided. I've learned the truth—for me, Corruption is a resource. The One with the Filth ability means the more corrupt I become, the stronger my Essence buffs grow. It's a feedback loop. A downward spiral that accelerates my power. Yes, I'm racing toward Terminal Error. Yes, I'm becoming a monster. But until that final moment, I am becoming the most powerful monster on the battlefield."*[^]

## Abilities: The Feast's Arsenal

### Tier 1 — Foundational Hunger

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Corrupted Metabolism** | Passive | — | Unlocks Consume command; +1 die vs [Poisoned]; +1 Corruption per [Blighted] consume |
| **Savage Rend** | Active | 40 Stamina | MIGHT-based melee attack; moderate Physical damage |
| **Tenderize** | Active | 35 Stamina | MIGHT-based attack; if killing blow, corpse becomes [Tenderized] |

**Corrupted Metabolism** is the foundation—the heretical adaptation that enables everything else.[^]

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Unlock Consume | Enables the core Consume command |
| Poison Resistance | +1 bonus die to Resolve Checks vs [Poisoned] |
| Corruption Interface | +1 permanent Corruption per [Blighted] corpse consumed |

> *"My body has undergone a profound, heretical adaptation. My stomach can process flesh that would kill a normal person. My metabolism extracts power from sources others would vomit up. The Corruption cost is automatic—I can't avoid it, can't reduce it. That's the price of admission. But the power I gain in return? Worth every stain on my soul."*[^]

**Tenderize** is the setup ability—the butcher's mark that enhances future meals.[^]

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cost | 35 Stamina |
| Damage | Low (MIGHT-based) |
| Special | If killing blow: corpse becomes [Tenderized] |
| [Tenderized] Bonus | Essence buffs last 5 rounds instead of 3 |

> *"The smart Hræ-eta doesn't just kill—they prepare. A Tenderize strike isn't about damage; it's about softening the meat. When I deliver the killing blow with this crushing strike, the corpse is pre-prepared. The Essence I extract lasts longer. Five rounds instead of three. That's the difference between winning a fight and dominating it."*[^]

**Savage Rend** is the core attack—the vicious, tearing strike.[^]

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cost | 40 Stamina |
| Damage | Moderate Physical (MIGHT-based) |
| Style | Brutal, pragmatic, designed to maim |

> *"Not a skillful duelist's strike. Not a disciplined soldier's blow. A vicious, tearing attack with whatever weapon I'm holding—or with my bare hands if need be. This is the butcher's cut. The predator's rend. I'm not trying to look elegant. I'm trying to generate corpses."*[^]

### Tier 2 — Advanced Appetites

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Devour Essence** | Passive | — | Chance to gain creature's Resistance when consuming |
| **Horrifying Feast** | Active | +10 Stamina to Consume | When consuming, enemies in Front Row make WILL check or [Feared] |
| **More Than a Memory** | Passive | — | Consuming humanoid grants temporary +1 to random non-combat Skill |

**Devour Essence** is the refinement passive—extracting specific "defensive subroutines."[^]

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Trigger | Successfully consume a corpse |
| Effect | Chance to gain one of creature's innate Resistances |
| Duration | For remainder of combat |
| Example | Consuming Flame-Salamander may grant [Fire Resistance] |

> *"My metabolism has grown more sophisticated. I don't just absorb raw power anymore—I can extract specific defensive subroutines. Consume a fire-resistant beast, and I may inherit that resistance. Consume a cold-blooded predator, and I may gain immunity to cold. Every meal is a lottery of potential defensive adaptations."*[^]

**Horrifying Feast** is the psychological weapon—the weaponization of the act itself.[^]

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cost | +10 Stamina (added to Consume cost) |
| Effect | When consuming, all Front Row enemies make WILL Resolve Check |
| Failure | [Feared] status for 1 round |
| Result | Transforms Consume from self-buff into psychological attack |

> *"The act of devouring a corpse mid-battle is a profound violation of the laws of nature and warfare. It is an act of pure, terrifying dominance. I learned to lean into that horror. When I consume now, I do it deliberately, visibly, grotesquely. I make eye contact with the living enemies while I tear into their fallen comrade. Their minds shatter. [Feared] enemies don't fight effectively. My meal becomes their nightmare."*[^]

**More Than a Memory** is the absorption passive—consuming not just flesh but fragments of identity.[^]

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Trigger | Consume a [Humanoid] corpse |
| Effect | Temporary +1 bonus to random non-combat Skill |
| Duration | Short (exploration phase) |
| Implication | Absorbing memories, instincts, fragments of victim's code |

> *"I don't just digest flesh anymore; I absorb memories. Instincts. Fragments of my victim's code. Consume a scholar, and for a brief time I know things I never learned. Consume a craftsman, and my hands remember skills my mind never acquired. It's disturbing. It's useful. It's another reason the others look at me with horror."*[^]

### Tier 3 — Mastery of Consumption

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Consume the Mighty** | Passive | — | Can now consume [Champion] and [Elite] corpses; enhanced buffs |
| **One with the Filth** | Passive | — | Essence buff potency/duration scales with current Corruption level |

**Consume the Mighty** is the expansion passive—processing the most powerful flesh.[^]

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| New Valid Targets | [Champion] and [Elite] faction corpses |
| Buff Quality | Significantly more powerful than standard Essence buffs |
| Unique Effects | May grant abilities or effects not available from standard corpses |

> *"My digestive system and will have grown strong enough to process the dense, power-filled flesh of Champion-level creatures. The party's strategy becomes simple: kill the champion first, so I can consume it and become even more monstrous for the rest of the fight. A Champion's Essence is not just stronger—it may grant unique effects that standard corpses cannot provide."*[^]

**One with the Filth** is the feedback loop—embracing the spiral.[^]

| Corruption Level | Buff Enhancement |
|------------------|------------------|
| Low (0-25) | Standard Essence effects |
| Moderate (26-50) | +25% potency and duration |
| High (51-75) | +50% potency and duration |
| Critical (76-99) | +75% potency and duration |

> *"My relationship with the Runic Blight has ceased to be a simple, transactional consumption. I no longer just endure my corruption; I draw power from it. The more the Blight infects my soul, the more efficiently I can process its physical manifestations. At high Corruption, my Essence buffs are devastating. The feedback loop rewards those who fully commit to the monstrous path."*[^]

### Capstone — Monstrous Apotheosis

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Cost** | 60 Stamina |
| **Requirement** | At least one [Essence] buff must be active |
| **Limit** | Once per combat |
| **Duration** | 3 rounds |
| **Effect** | Enter [Apotheosis] state with ALL consumed Essence buffs simultaneously |

The capstone **Monstrous Apotheosis** is the ultimate expression—the final, willing transgression.[^]

│  "You willingly surrender to the chorus     │

│   of consumed consciousnesses within."      │

│                                             │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

> *"This is the final, willing transgression. I surrender to the chorus of consumed consciousnesses within me. My form twists and swells, becoming a monstrous avatar of all the beasts and warriors I have devoured. For three rounds, I have the regeneration of beasts AND the strength of warriors AND whatever unique essences I've absorbed—all at once. I am a god of flesh and hunger. The cost? A massive, permanent chunk of my remaining humanity. A leap toward the abyss. Reserve this for when the alternative is death for everyone you care about."*[^]

## Systemic Integration

### Combat Role: The Ramping Juggernaut

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Primary Function** | Self-buffing attrition specialist; escalating threat |
| **Power Source** | Heretical consumption of organic corpses |
| **Unique Contribution** | Only specialization that grows stronger during extended combat |

The Hræ-eta is a **ramping, self-buffing juggernaut**.[^] They are weakest at the start of a fight and become an unstoppable force of nature as the battlefield fills with corpses. Their power curve is the inverse of most specializations—they're investing early turns in consumption to dominate late turns.

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Heretical (extreme Corruption accumulation) |
| **Corruption Sources** | Every [Blighted] corpse consumed (+1); Monstrous Apotheosis (massive) |
| **Feedback Loop** | One with the Filth makes Corruption beneficial to buff potency |
| **Campaign Arc** | Downward spiral toward Terminal Error; race to achieve goals first |

The Hræ-eta has the **most direct and visceral interface with Runic Blight Corruption** of any specialization.[^] For them, Corruption is not just a penalty—it is a resource, a measure of their commitment, and a catalyst for their power.

> *"My Corruption meter fills faster than any other specialization. Every Blighted meal, every Apotheosis, every embrace of the monster within—it all accumulates. The others see the meter climbing and feel horror. I see it climbing and feel power. The One with the Filth ability means my buffs grow stronger as I corrupt. I'm on a timer, yes. I'm spiraling toward Terminal Error. But until that final moment, I am becoming something magnificent and terrible."*

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **High-damage dealers** | Generate corpses quickly for Hræ-eta to consume |
| **Controllers** | Keep enemies in place while Hræ-eta consumes |
| **Bone-Setter** | Cannot cleanse Corruption, but can manage HP loss |
| **Tanky allies** | Protect Hræ-eta during consumption actions |

**Negative Synergies:**

| Situation | Issue |
|-----------|-------|
| **Necromancer allies** | Competing for corpses (raise vs consume) |
| **Scavenger allies** | Competing for corpses (harvest vs consume) |
| **[Undying]-focused dungeons** | Core mechanic completely useless |
| **[Forlorn]-focused dungeons** | Core mechanic completely useless |
| **"Pure" faction allies** | Social friction from visible corruption |

### Situational Power Profile

| Condition | Performance |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Optimal** | Extended fights; multiple organic enemies; [Beast]/[Humanoid] heavy |
| **Weak** | Short fights (no time to ramp); opening rounds before kills |
| **Hard Counters** | Organic faction enemies; multi-wave encounters; attrition battles |
| **Hard Countered By** | [Undying]-only encounters; [Forlorn]-only encounters; no organic corpses |

## Lore Integration

### The Philosophy of the Corpse-Eater

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Heritage** | Survivors who discovered the power in Blighted flesh |
| **Philosophy** | In a dying world, all things are resources |
| **Method** | Brute-force data acquisition through consumption |
| **Status** | Feared, reviled, but undeniably effective |

The Hræ-eta tradition emerged from the desperate survivors who discovered that **the Blight could be consumed rather than just endured**.[^] In the famine-scarred wastes of post-Glitch Aethelgard, some desperate souls ate Blighted meat and survived. More than survived—they gained power. The tradition grew from there, refined through generations of horrifying experimentation.

> *"The first Hræ-eta were starving refugees who had no choice. The Blighted meat was all that was left. They expected to die. Instead, they transformed. They gained the strength of their meals, the resilience of beasts, the borrowed power of the corruption itself. Some died horribly. Others became something new. Something monstrous. Something powerful."*

### The Downward Spiral

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Early Career** | Occasional consumption; manageable Corruption |
| **Mid Career** | Regular consumption; visible signs of corruption |
| **Late Career** | Heavy consumption; high Corruption; social isolation |
| **End State** | Racing toward Terminal Error; monstrous power; diminishing humanity |

The Hræ-eta's saga is inherently **tragic**.[^] They are on a constant, unavoidable downward spiral toward Terminal Error. Their story is a race to achieve their goals before their own bargains consume them.

### Factional Perspectives

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the famine-scarred wastes of post-Glitch Aethelgard, where the Runic Blight has twisted all life and sustenance is scarce, the Hræ-eta have embraced the ultimate, horrifying pragmatism: all things are a resource, even the dead. They are corpse-eaters who have learned to consume the flesh of their fallen foes, absorbing fragments of their victims' primal code through what the Jötun-Readers call 'brute-force data acquisition.' To eat the flesh of a beast is to steal its regenerative vitality. To eat the flesh of a warrior is to borrow their martial strength. But every Blighted meal stains the soul—permanent Runic Blight Corruption accumulating with each transgression. This is the Heretical Bargain: trading humanity for power, piece by piece, in a constant downward spiral toward Terminal Error. At the height of their corruption, they can trigger Monstrous Apotheosis, surrendering to the chorus of consumed consciousnesses to become a twisted avatar of all they have devoured. Their saga is a gruesome chronicle of self-corruption, a race to achieve their goals before their own bargains consume them. They are feared, reviled, and undeniably effective. In a dying world, the Hræ-eta have made peace with becoming monsters."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Hræ-eta (Corpse-Eater) represents the heretical Warrior specialization optimized for self-buffing attrition warfare through organic consumption mechanics. Mechanical role: ramping juggernaut who grows stronger through extended combat. Core mechanics: Corpse Consumption (Standard Action to consume [Beast] or [Humanoid] corpses for [Essence] buffs), Essence Absorption (different buffs from different creature types—[Beast] grants [Regeneration], [Humanoid] grants +2 MIGHT), and The Heretical Bargain (every [Blighted] corpse consumed grants +1 permanent Corruption). Key differentiator: only specialization with direct, constant Corruption accumulation as core mechanic; power scales with combat length and corpse availability. Signature ability: Monstrous Apotheosis (enter transformed state with ALL consumed Essence buffs simultaneously, massive Corruption cost). Trauma Economy integration: Extreme; most direct interface with Runic Blight Corruption; One with the Filth passive makes Corruption beneficial to buff potency, creating feedback loop that incentivizes embracing the spiral. Social function: feared and reviled; social alienation from coherent factions as visible corruption accumulates. Hard counters: [Undying] and [Forlorn] factions (cannot consume mechanical or spiritual corpses, rendering core mechanic useless). Optimal deployment: extended fights with multiple organic enemies; attrition battles; scenarios where ramping power curve has time to develop."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Hræ-eta (Corpse-Eater). ARCHETYPE: Warrior. PATH TYPE: Heretical. ROLE: Self-Buffing Juggernaut / Heretical Survivalist / Attrition Specialist. PRIMARY STAT: MIGHT. SECONDARY STAT: WILL. RESOURCE: Stamina + Essence Buffs. CORE MECHANICS: Corpse Consumption (Standard Action, 20 Stamina, consume [Beast] or [Humanoid] corpse, gain [Essence] buff, +1 Corruption if [Blighted]), Essence Absorption ([Essence of Beast] grants [Regeneration] 3 rounds, [Essence of Man] grants +2 MIGHT 3 rounds, [Tenderized] corpse extends to 5 rounds, one Essence buff at a time), The Heretical Bargain (One with the Filth scales buff potency/duration with Corruption level: 0-25 standard, 26-50 +25%, 51-75 +50%, 76-99 +75%). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Hunger): Corrupted Metabolism (passive, unlock Consume, +1 Corruption per [Blighted], +1 die vs [Poisoned]), Savage Rend (40 Stamina, MIGHT melee moderate damage), Tenderize (35 Stamina, low damage, if killing blow corpse becomes [Tenderized]). T2 (Advanced Appetites): Devour Essence (passive, chance to gain creature Resistance), Horrifying Feast (+10 Stamina to Consume, Front Row enemies WILL check or [Feared] 1 round), More Than a Memory (passive, humanoid corpse grants +1 random non-combat Skill). T3 (Mastery of Consumption): Consume the Mighty (passive, can consume [Champion]/[Elite] corpses for enhanced buffs), One with the Filth (passive, Corruption level increases Essence potency/duration). CAPSTONE: Monstrous Apotheosis (60 Stamina + massive permanent Corruption, once per combat, requires active [Essence], 3 rounds [Apotheosis] state with massive MIGHT/STURDINESS bonus and ALL consumed Essence buffs simultaneously). TRAUMA ECONOMY: Extreme; +1 Corruption per [Blighted] consume, massive Corruption on Apotheosis; One with the Filth creates feedback loop incentivizing Corruption accumulation. HARD COUNTERS: [Undying]-only or [Forlorn]-only encounters (no valid corpses = useless)."*

## Summary

The Hræ-eta is the **corpse-eater who has made peace with becoming a monster**.

They are Warriors who have embraced the ultimate pragmatism: in a world defined by decay, all things are resources—even the dead. Their core mechanic is Corpse Consumption, devouring the flesh of fallen [Beast] and [Humanoid] enemies to gain powerful [Essence] buffs. Every Blighted meal costs permanent Corruption. Every Corruption point brings them closer to Terminal Error. But every Corruption point also makes their buffs stronger through One with the Filth.

Their gameplay is **ramping juggernaut warfare**. They start fights as ordinary warriors, but as corpses accumulate, they become increasingly monstrous. The Horrifying Feast ability weaponizes the act of consumption itself, terrifying enemies who witness the grotesque spectacle. Tenderize ensures that corpses yield maximum power. And Monstrous Apotheosis represents the ultimate expression—surrendering to the chorus of consumed consciousnesses to become an avatar of all they have devoured.

Their unique risk is **faction dependency**. Against [Undying] constructs or [Forlorn] spirits, they have no valid corpses to consume. Their entire toolkit becomes useless. They are gods in one dungeon and ordinary warriors in the next.

The capstone transforms them into the ultimate expression of the Heretical Bargain—massive power for massive Corruption. It is reserved for when the alternative is death for everyone.

This is the fantasy of the **survivor who has traded their humanity for power**—not a hero who fights corruption, but a monster who has learned to consume it.

*"All things are resources, even the dead."*
*"To consume the Blight is to become the Blight."*
*"Your saga is a gruesome chronicle of self-corruption."*
