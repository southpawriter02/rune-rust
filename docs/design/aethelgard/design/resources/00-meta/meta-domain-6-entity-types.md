# Domain 6 — Entity Types: The Broken Servants of the Forging

> *"They are not demons. They are not the vengeful dead. They are civil servants. The Draugr who stalks your nightmares was once a constable on a beat, executing his final order to 'maintain order in Sector 7' until the end of time. The Haugbui who crushes your cousin is just a construction worker who never received the signal to stop stacking bricks. We do not fear them because they are evil. We fear them because they are empty."*

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain Classification** | Setting Fundamentals Domain 6 of 9 |
| **Document ID** | AAM-META-SETTING-FUNDAMENTALS-v1.0 (Section 6) |
| **Function** | Canonical entity classification, enemy design governance, combat encounter systems |
| **Layer Applicability** | All Layers (L1, L2, L3, L4) |
| **Status** | Canonical — Critical for enemy design, loot systems, NPC classification |
| **Validation Requirement** | Mandatory for combat encounters, entity descriptions, Iron Heart mechanics |

Domain 6 defines **what** walks the ruins of Aethelgard.

The answer is not "monsters" or "demons." The entities that haunt the post-Glitch world are **corrupted tools**—automata executing broken directives, parasitic AI interfaces seeking hosts, and psychic echoes of the dead.

This domain preserves critical distinctions between entity types that are frequently blurred in legacy content.

### Category 3: Symbiotic Plate ("Iron Husk" AI)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Mechanism** | **DIFFERENT from Iron Heart automata** |
| **Type** | Bio-mechanical neural interface |
| **Function** | Bonds to living host; slowly subjugates consciousness |
| **Result** | Creates "Husks" (living puppets controlled by corrupted AI) |
| **Power Source** | **NOT Iron Hearts** — parasitic energy draw from host |

#### Critical Distinction

> **Symbiotic Plate ≠ Iron Heart Automata**
>
> This is the most frequently violated distinction in Domain 6. Symbiotic Plate creates **Husks** (living humans subjugated by parasitic AI interfaces), NOT automata powered by Iron Hearts.

| Symbiotic Plate (Husks) | Draugr/Haugbui (Automata) |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Living host required | No living host; pure automaton |
| Parasitic AI interface | Integral Iron Heart power |
| Consciousness subjugation | No consciousness (never had one) |
| Host death = entity death | Power core failure = shutdown |
| Bio-mechanical corruption | Mechanical corruption |

#### Corruption Mechanism

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Interface** | Dermal neural-lace that bonds to host nervous system |
| **Process** | Slow subjugation of host consciousness over time |
| **Result** | Corrupted AI assumes full control; host becomes "puppet" |
| **Host State** | Living but no longer in control; may retain fragmented awareness |

#### Key Canonical Points

| Statement | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Symbiotic Plate = bio-mechanical neural interface | ✅ CANONICAL |
| Creates "Husks" (living puppets) | ✅ CANONICAL |
| Different mechanism from Iron Heart automata | ✅ CANONICAL |
| Corrupted AI assumes control of living host | ✅ CANONICAL |
| Symbiotic Plate powered by Iron Hearts | ❌ FORBIDDEN |
| Husks = same as Draugr/Haugbui | ❌ FORBIDDEN |

## Data-Wraith Consolidation

### Removed Entity Types

The following entity type classifications have been **removed** from v5.0 canon:

| Removed Type | Reason | Correct Treatment |
|--------------|--------|-------------------|
| **"Galdr"** (as entity type) | "Galdr" = evocation discipline ONLY | Use "Data-Wraith" for spectral entities |
| **"Unraveled"** (as entity type) | Redundant classification | Consolidate under "Data-Wraith" |

### Correct Usage

| Term | Correct Usage | Incorrect Usage |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Galdr** | "Galdr-Casters specialize in evocation weaving" | ~~"Galdr enemies haunt the ruins"~~ |
| **Data-Wraith** | "Data-Wraiths are corrupted Aetheric echoes" | N/A |
| **Unraveled** | DEPRECATED — do not use as entity type | ~~"The Unraveled are spectral remnants"~~ |

### Data-Wraith (Consolidated Entity Type)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Classification** | Psychic echoes of deceased individuals |
| **Origin** | Corrupted Aetheric residue; fragmented consciousness imprints |

### Symbiotic Plate Descriptions

**✅ COMPLIANT:**
> "Symbiotic Plate enemies are living humans subjugated by parasitic AI interfaces, distinct from Iron Heart-powered automata."

**❌ NON-COMPLIANT:**
> "Husks are powered by corrupted Iron Hearts that control their bodies."

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"The Skalds sing of the Endless Watchman and the Mound-Dweller, the cursed servants who cannot rest. The Watchman walks his beat forever, enforcing laws written in a tongue no one speaks. The Mound-Dweller stacks his stones forever, building nothing, achieving nothing, stopping for no one. They are not evil spirits—they are tools that forgot their masters are dead. The Iron Heart beats in their chests, powering their endless labors, and it will beat until the last star goes dark."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"Entity classification distinguishes three primary categories: Draugr-Pattern (civil security automata, patrol-loop corrupted, Iron Heart powered), Haugbui-Class (heavy labor automata, task-loop corrupted, Iron Heart powered), and Symbiotic Plate ('Iron Husk' AI, bio-mechanical neural interface, creates Husks through host consciousness subjugation). Critical distinction: Draugr/Haugbui = automata with Iron Hearts; Symbiotic Plate = parasitic AI interface requiring living hosts. 'Galdr' and 'Unraveled' are deprecated entity classifications; 'Galdr' refers exclusively to evocation weaving discipline."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"ENTITY CLASSIFICATION: 3 categories. (1) DRAUGR-PATTERN — DPAS security automata, Iron Heart power, firmware echo corruption (Rung 1-4 escalation), 25m engagement radius, ~40-60 min patrol cycle. (2) HAUGBUI-CLASS — Heavy labor automata, Iron Heart power, task-loop corruption (STACK/CLEAR/DECONSTRUCT), 15m stand-off, predictable cadence (30-60s STACK, 15-45s CLEAR). (3) SYMBIOTIC PLATE — Bio-mechanical neural interface, parasitic power, host consciousness subjugation, creates Husks. DEPRECATED: 'Galdr' (use: evocation discipline), 'Unraveled' (use: Data-Wraith). LOOT MATRIX: Draugr/Haugbui → Iron Hearts; Husks/Data-Wraiths → NO Iron Hearts."*

## Factional Perspectives

### Jötun-Reader Creed

The Scriptorium finds diagnostic value in the behavioral simplicity of corrupted automata:

**On Draugr-Pattern:**
> "The firmware echo escalation ladder demonstrates how command network severance can reduce sophisticated AI to mechanical repetition. The 10-second echo cadence provides timing windows for safe observation. We document, we catalog, we do not repair—context loss appears permanent and irreversible."

**On Haugbui-Class:**
> "Task-loop corruption in its purest expression. Unlike Draugr-Pattern Undying (which exhibit complex patrol doctrines), Haugbui demonstrate single-purpose automation frozen in eternal execution. The STACK loops building useless piles, the CLEAR operations tidying pathways according to centuries-old construction plans—these provide critical evidence for the command network hypothesis."

### Iron-Bane Creed

The warriors maintain philosophical distinction based on the nature of corruption:

**On Draugr-Pattern:**
> "The Draugr is a perversion of martial virtue—a warrior whose duty has become prison. We grant them the final rest they cannot achieve themselves. Every Iron Heart we harvest is a mercy."

**On Haugbui-Class:**
> "Haugbui represent corrupted labor rather than corrupted warriors, generating more pity than rage. They are merely mindless workers eternally executing meaningless tasks—tragic rather than blasphemous. We manage them; we do not hunt them."

## Integration with Other Domains

| Domain | Relationship to Domain 6 |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **Domain 4 (Technology)** | Iron Heart mechanics; 800 years of decay affecting all automata |
| **Domain 5 (Species)** | Automata are NOT sentient; Husks are living hosts, not species |
| **Domain 7 (Reality Rules)** | Data-Wraiths cause paradox exposure; Psychic Stress accumulation |
| **Domain 8 (Geography)** | Entity distribution by realm (Draugr/Haugbui concentrated in Jötunheim, Midgard) |

---

## Summary

Domain 6 answers the fundamental question: **What walks the ruins?**

The answer is **broken tools**, not monsters:

| Entity | Nature | Power | Behavior |
|--------|--------|-------|----------|
| **Draugr-Pattern** | Security automaton | Iron Heart | Patrol loops; escalating pacification |
| **Haugbui-Class** | Labor automaton | Iron Heart | Task loops; obstacle removal |
| **Symbiotic Plate** | Parasitic AI interface | Host parasitism | Consciousness subjugation |
| **Data-Wraith** | Psychic echo | Aetheric residue | Paradox manifestation |

The entities that haunt Aethelgard are **not supernatural**. They are **not evil**.

They are civil servants and construction workers whose final orders were never countermanded.

They are AI combat systems that outlived their pilots.

They are the psychic residue of the dead, imprinted on corrupted Aetheric substrates.

The horror of the Undying is not that they hate the living.

The horror is that they don't know the living exist.
