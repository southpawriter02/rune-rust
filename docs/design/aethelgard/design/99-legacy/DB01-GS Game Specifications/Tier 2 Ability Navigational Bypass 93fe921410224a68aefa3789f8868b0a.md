### **Ability Overview**

**Specialization:** Jötun-Reader (System Pathologist)

**Tier:** 2 (Advanced Tactical Support)

**Type:** Active (Standard Action, Out of Combat Only)

**Prerequisite:** 8 PP spent in the Jötun-Reader tree

**Cost:** 4 PP

### **Description**

The Jötun-Reader analyzes the construction of a trap or hazardous area, consulting faded schematics in their mind's eye to find a safe path. Through years of studying Old World architecture and engineering patterns, they can identify design flaws, maintenance access routes, and structural weaknesses that allow circumvention of dangerous obstacles.

### **Mechanics**

**Action Cost:** Standard Action, 30 Stamina (Out of Combat only)

**Effect:** Grants the entire party a **bonus die (+1d10)** on their next skill check to:

- Avoid an environmental trap
- Disarm a mechanical hazard
- Navigate through a dangerous area
- Bypass a security system

**Limitations:**

- Cannot be used in combat (requires focus and time)
- Does not automatically succeed—only improves party's chances
- Requires the Jötun-Reader to perceive the hazard first

### **Thematic Justification**

The Jötun-Reader is not disabling or hacking traps—they're **reading the architectural language** of Old World construction to identify bypass routes. They might notice:

- Maintenance access panels that bypass security
- Load-bearing structural weaknesses that can be safely exploited
- Design patterns that reveal trigger mechanisms
- Erosion and decay that has created safe paths

### **Progression & Milestones**

### **Rank 1 (Foundational)**

- **Stamina Cost:** 30
- **Effect:** Grants party +1d10 to next trap/hazard bypass check
- **Limitation:** Out of combat only

### **Rank 2 (Expert)**

- **Unlocked:** 20 PP invested in Jötun-Reader tree
- **Stamina Cost:** Reduced to 20
- **Effect:** Grants party **+2d10** to next bypass check
- **Additional:** Critical Success grants **retry** on different hazard within 1 hour

### **Rank 3 (Mastery)**

- **Unlocked:** Capstone ability unlocked (35-40 PP in tree)
- **Effect:** Grants party **+3d10** to next **2 bypass checks**
- **Additional:** Critical Success **permanently disables/neutralizes** the hazard
- **Special:** Can now be used **in combat** as a Standard Action (environmental hazards only)

---

### **Example Applications**

- **Pressure Plate Trap:** "The trigger mechanism is corroded on the western edge. If we distribute our weight evenly along that side, the sensor won't register the threshold pressure."
- **Security Laser Grid:** "The emitter array is powered by a central relay. If we disconnect the power coupling in the maintenance alcove, the grid will deactivate."
- **Collapsing Bridge:** "The support structure is compromised, but the secondary load-bearing cables are still intact. We need to cross one at a time, staying close to the left railing."

### **Synergies**

- **Scholarly Acumen I:** Bonus die stacks with this ability for investigation checks
- **Structural Insight:** Automatic detection of hazards synergizes with bypass guidance
- **Party Skills:** Works best when party has members with relevant skills

- **Scholarly Acumen I** (Tier 1): Enhances investigation and bypass attempts
- **Structural Insight** (Tier 2): Automatic detection enables informed use
- **Runic Linguistics** (Tier 1): Translated warnings inform bypass strategies
