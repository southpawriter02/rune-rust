## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Static Lash is the God-Sleeper Cultist's **basic attack ability**—a focused lance of psychic noise that deals damage and applies the signature [Psychic Static] debuff. This establishes their primary damage type (Psychic) and control identity.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Deal moderate Psychic damage to single target
- **Secondary:** Apply [Psychic Static] debuff (WILL penalty)
- **Self-Cost:** Small Psychic Stress to caster
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The weaponized mental static of the machine gods

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Moderate (damage + debuff combination)
- **Self-Damage:** Small Psychic Stress creates meaningful but manageable cost
- **Debuff Application:** [Psychic Static] sets up other abilities

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Cultist focuses their mind, channeling a fragment of the God-Sleepers' disorienting broadcast. The psychic noise—that endless, maddening hum that drives the faithful to ecstasy and the unfaithful to madness—is compressed into a single, targeted lance of pure mental static.

The target feels it as a **screaming in their skull**—not words, but the raw, corrupted data of a dying world. Their thoughts fragment, their will wavers, and for a terrible moment, they hear what the Cultist hears: the voice of the sleeping gods.

### Thematic Resonance

Static Lash is the Cultist sharing their "gift"—forcing others to experience the psychic noise that they have learned to embrace. It is both weapon and evangelism.

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Static Pulse (Tier 2):** AoE version for groups; both apply [Psychic Static]
- **Override Protocol (Tier 3):** [Psychic Static] may lower target's WILL resistance
- **Jötun-Forged Attunement:** [Attuned] reduces AP cost
- **Thul (Demoralizing Diatribe):** Combined WILL debuffs stack devastatingly

### Negative Synergies

- **Psychic-immune enemies:** Some creatures may resist Psychic damage
- **High-WILL targets:** May resist [Psychic Static] effects
- **Self-Stress accumulation:** Repeated use builds Cultist's Psychic Stress
