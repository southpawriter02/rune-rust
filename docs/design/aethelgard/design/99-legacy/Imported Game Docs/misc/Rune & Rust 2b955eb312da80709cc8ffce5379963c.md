### Architecture Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Core models, game logic, and UI are in separate projects
- **No Logic in Models**: Core project contains only POCOs
- **No UI in Engine**: Engine project has no console/display code
- **Clean Dependencies**: ConsoleApp → Engine → Core (one direction only)

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) or later
- Visual Studio 2022, VS Code, or Rider (optional)

### Build

```bash
# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Build the solution
dotnet build

# Or build in Release mode
dotnet build -c Release

```

### Run

```bash
# Run from the ConsoleApp directory
cd RuneAndRust.ConsoleApp
dotnet run

# Or run directly from solution root
dotnet run --project RuneAndRust.ConsoleApp

```
