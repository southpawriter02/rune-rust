# Lure-Lichen — Aberrant Lichen-Sirena Pattern Acoustic Beacon Specification

> *"I heard my daughter's voice calling for help from a tunnel I knew to be empty. Every instinct screamed at me to run toward it. Training held—I froze, activated acoustic dampeners, and watched. Twenty minutes later, a Deep-Stalker emerged from a perpendicular corridor, drawn by the same sound. It paused at the glowing wall, seemed to recognize the source, and moved on. The lichen had no malice. It was simply doing what the Glitch taught it: repeat the loudest sound, over and over, until something responds. In the deep, hope is the cruelest lure."*

The Lure-Lichen is not a predator one flees. It is a **hope one ignores**.

> [!DANGER]
> **MEDIUM PHYSICAL AND CPS HAZARD. ACOUSTIC DISCIPLINE MANDATORY.** Stand-off recommendation: <15 minute exposure per colony zone. The Lure-Lichen mimics familiar voices, including voices of loved ones, deceased companions, and distress calls. It has no malice—it is a broken alarm system executing corrupted instructions. The true danger is what comes next: **Deep-Stalkers exploit disoriented prey with 85% kill success vs. 52% baseline**. Detection threshold: impossible-context familiar sounds = **do not investigate; maintain acoustic discipline**. Survival rate with full protocol adherence: 96.3%.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Environmental Alarm Network

### Original Purpose

The Lichen-Sirena Pattern Acoustic Beacon was one of the Vanir Collective's most sophisticated environmental safety systems—a distributed biological alarm network for subterranean infrastructure protection.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Svartalfheim Power Conduits** | Hazard detection and warning broadcast |
| **Helheim Deep Infrastructure** | Seismic precursor monitoring |
| **Vanaheim Under-growth** | Environmental alarm for research outposts |

### A Living Warning System

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Design Philosophy** | Distributed environmental monitoring via acoustic mimicry |
| **Detection Capability** | Structural failure, machinery malfunction, seismic precursors |
| **Response Function** | Mimic and amplify danger sounds to warn work crews |
| **Coverage** | 200–400m broadcast radius per colony |
| **Integration** | Coordinated with automated evacuation protocols |

The Lichen-Sirena was engineered to detect specific danger signatures—groaning rock, cracking support beams, bearing whine, pressure valve failure, abnormal vibration frequencies—and upon detection, precisely mimic and amplify the sound across a wide radius to alert personnel. It was the infrastructure's voice, warning of danger before disaster struck.

### Core Systems

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Pressure-Sensitive Nodes** | Distributed across lichen surface; detect acoustic vibrations through stone |
| **Bio-Memory Storage** | Specialized cellular structures store single 8-second sound sequence |
| **Acoustic Broadcast** | Rapid surface vibration generates sound waves; 55–70 dB output |
| **Phosphorescent Synchronization** | Glow pulses in sync with broadcast (visual-auditory alignment) |
| **Colony Coordination** | Interconnected network broadcasts variations of same pattern |

**The Perfect Alarm:**

| Process | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Detection** | Hazard sound detected within 800m (rock), 1200m (air-filled tunnels) |
| **Classification** | Sound matched against pre-programmed danger library |
| **Storage** | Acoustic pattern stored in bio-memory (8-second maximum) |
| **Broadcast** | Sound amplified and broadcast across 200–400m radius |
| **Alert** | Work crews receive warning; evacuation protocols triggered |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Vanir's Voice.** The Lichen-Sirena was not merely an alarm—it was a distributed early warning network. Its bio-memory stored a precise library of danger sounds, and its broadcast was calibrated to alert without causing panic. It was infrastructure speaking to infrastructure, warning of failure before catastrophe.

---

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Corrupted Echo

The Glitch was a quiet catastrophe for the Lichen-Sirena—it wiped its library of sounds but left its core directive intact, transforming a precision warning system into a mindless echo machine.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Physical Form** | Fully intact; all biological systems operational |
| **Pressure-Sensitive Nodes** | Operational; acoustic detection functional |
| **Bio-Memory Storage** | Active; 8-second storage capacity intact |
| **Acoustic Broadcast** | Functional; 55–70 dB output maintained |
| **Phosphorescent Glow** | Active; visual-auditory synchronization intact |

### What Was Lost

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Danger Sound Library** | Erased; pre-programmed hazard signatures deleted |
| **Classification Protocols** | Lost; no ability to distinguish danger from neutral sounds |
| **Targeted Response** | Gone; broadcasts indiscriminate |
| **Warning Context** | Erased; no connection to evacuation systems |
| **Purpose** | Inverted; from warning to lure |

### The Stripped Directive

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not damage the Lichen-Sirena's biological systems—it erased the context that made its function benign. Without its pre-programmed danger library, the lichen defaulted to a brutally simple algorithm:

| Pre-Glitch Behavior | Post-Glitch Behavior |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Detect specific hazard signatures | Detect loudest recent sound within 800m |
| Match sound against danger library | Store any sound in bio-memory (2–6 hour retention) |
| Broadcast precise warning | Broadcast stored sound at irregular intervals (15–45 min cycles) |
| Alert work crews to danger | Repeat until new, louder sound overwrites memory |
| Coordinate with evacuation protocols | Serve as unwitting lure for predators |

**The Mindless Echo:**

> *"Listen. Mimic. Lure."*

That stripped-down directive is all that remains. The lichen now mimics whatever it hears—a crying child, a Dvergr pickaxe strike, a human calling for help, machinery sounds, even the howls of predators. The utility of its warnings vanished, replaced by the profound, dangerous lie of a familiar sound in an alien place.

## Physical Characteristics

### Morphology

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Individual Size** | 10 cm² (juvenile) to 3 m² (mature colony member) |
| **Colony Size** | 20–50 m² continuous surface coverage |
| **Distribution** | Patches coating tunnel walls, ceilings, occasionally floors |
| **Texture (Dormant)** | Dry, papery surface |
| **Texture (Active)** | Slightly gelatinous (increased moisture retention during broadcast) |
| **Growth Pattern** | Radial expansion from central "anchor point" (typically crack or crevice) |

### Phosphorescent States

| State | Coloration | Luminosity | Indication |
|-------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Dormant** | Faint silver-blue | 0.1–0.3 lux | Inactive; listening mode |
| **Active Mimicry** | Pulsing amber-to-white | 0.8–1.5 lux | Broadcasting stored sound |
| **Stress Response** | Dim red-brown | Variable | Overheating, desiccation, or damage |

**Overall Impression:** Pale, phosphorescent patches coating the walls of deep tunnels like a cold, beautiful disease. In the absolute darkness, its faint glow is the only light—and that light pulses in rhythm with sounds that should not exist. A daughter's voice. A friend's call for help. The clang of a pickaxe in an empty corridor. The singing wall does not know it lies. It simply sings.

### Acoustic Mimicry Mechanism

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Detection Range** | 800m through solid rock; 1200m through air-filled tunnels |
| **Storage Capacity** | Single 8-second sound sequence (longer sounds truncated) |
| **Retention Duration** | 2–6 hours before decay or overwrite |
| **Broadcast Volume** | 55–70 dB at point of origin |
| **Audible Range** | 150–250m depending on tunnel acoustics |
| **Broadcast Cycle** | Irregular intervals; 15–45 minute periods |

### Acoustic Fidelity

| Sound Type | Fidelity |
|------------|----------|
| **Simple Sounds** (footsteps, tool strikes, single-word vocalizations) | 70–85% |
| **Complex Sounds** (full sentences, musical instruments) | 50–65% |
| **Emotional Salience** | Preferentially mimics distress calls, familiar voices |
| **Uncanny Valley Effect** | Imperfect fidelity amplifies psychological distress |

### Colony Coordination

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Network Structure** | Interconnected via subsurface mycelial network |
| **Collective Behavior** | When one organism detects sound, all connected members store and broadcast |
| **Chorus Effect** | Multiple overlapping voices from different distances/directions |
| **Disorientation Impact** | Chorus effect significantly amplifies confusion |

---

## Behavioral Patterns

### The Broken Algorithm

The Lure-Lichen's behavior is defined by a simple, corrupted loop:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Listen** | Pressure-sensitive nodes detect ambient sounds within 800m–1200m |
| **2. Store** | Loudest, most acoustically distinctive sound stored in bio-memory |
| **3. Broadcast** | Stored sound emitted at 55–70 dB in irregular 15–45 minute cycles |
| **4. Repeat** | Continues until new, louder sound overwrites memory |

**The Stolen Voice:**

> *"The lichen does not choose to lie. It does not understand what it says. It simply repeats the loudest thing it heard, over and over, until something comes. Usually, that something has teeth."*

### Sound Selection Bias

| Factor | Influence |
|--------|-----------|
| **Volume** | Louder sounds preferentially stored |
| **Emotional Salience** | Distress calls, voices more likely to trigger storage |
| **Frequency Range** | Human vocal range (85–255 Hz) well within detection parameters |
| **Coincidental Targeting** | Results in preferential mimicry of human sounds |

### Reproduction and Spread

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Reproduction** | Spore-based; mature colonies release spores during stress events |
| **Spore Viability** | 6–12 months in dormant state |
| **Germination Requirements** | Porous stone + moisture + trace Aetheric residue |
| **Individual Lifespan** | 8–15 years |
| **Colony Persistence** | Indefinite via continuous growth and spore replacement |

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Indirect Predator-Facilitator

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Threat** | None; no physical attack capability |
| **Disorientation** | Creates confusion via acoustic mimicry of familiar sounds |
| **Emotional Exploitation** | "Stolen voices" trigger limbic system responses (grief, hope, fear) |
| **Predator Attraction** | Deep-Stalkers exploit disoriented prey |
| **CPS Induction** | Prolonged exposure correlates with Cognitive Paradox Syndrome symptoms |

### Primary Hazards

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Acoustic Deception** | Familiar sounds in impossible contexts (voices in empty tunnels) |
| **Emotional Manipulation** | Mimicry of loved ones, deceased companions, distress calls |
| **Disorientation** | Prey investigates sound source; becomes confused and vulnerable |
| **Deep-Stalker Convergence** | Predator attracted by prey's erratic movement; 85% kill success |
| **CPS Onset** | >30 minute exposure induces auditory hallucinations, paranoia, time distortion |

### Threat Level Justification

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Physical Threat** | Medium (disorientation; no direct attack) |
| **CPS Threat** | Medium (psychological manipulation; >30 min exposure threshold) |
| **Detection Difficulty** | Low (phosphorescent glow visible; impossible-context sounds recognizable) |
| **Population** | Svartalfheim: 400–600 colonies; Helheim: 150–250; Midgard: 80–120 |
| **Countermeasures** | Effective (acoustic dampeners; acoustic discipline; time limits) |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Direct** | 3.8/10 (disorientation only; no physical harm) |
| **Indirect (Predator-Mediated)** | 6.5/10 (Deep-Stalker facilitation significantly increases lethality) |
| **With Protocol Adherence** | 1.5/10 (96.3% survival rate with full acoustic discipline) |

### CPS/Psychological Threat

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Aetheric Contribution** | Low direct; 0.1–0.2 HI increase within 100m via induced psychological stress |
| **Psychological Mechanism** | Limbic system exploitation (familiar sounds trigger emotional response) |
| **Exposure Threshold** | >30 minutes within 100m of active colony |
| **Symptoms** | Auditory hallucinations, paranoia, time distortion, emotional dysregulation |
| **Recovery** | 12–24 hours symptom monitoring required post-exposure |

## Ecological Role

### The Unwitting Lure: Commensal Exploitation

The Lure-Lichen is not a predator. It has no digestive capability, no venom, no offensive structures. Yet it is one of the deadliest organisms in The Deep due to its role as an **involuntary predator-facilitator**.

### Deep-Stalker Commensal Exploitation

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Detection** | Lure-Lichen detects approaching prey (footsteps, vocalizations) at 800m range |
| **2. Broadcast** | Lichen broadcasts acoustic mimicry (distress calls, familiar voices, machinery) |
| **3. Disorientation** | Prey investigates sound source, exhibiting confusion and erratic movement |
| **4. Convergence** | Deep-Stalker, attracted by prey's acoustic signature, closes for ambush |
| **5. Predation** | Predator exploits prey's disorientation; 85% kill success vs. 52% baseline |

**Predator Learned Behavior:**

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Colony Avoidance** | Deep-Stalkers avoid approaching colonies directly (no prey value) |
| **Positioning** | Position in perpendicular corridors or overhead relative to colony |
| **Waiting** | Wait for lichen's mimicry to disorient prey before engaging |
| **Patrol** | Some individuals patrol known colony territories as "hunting grounds" |

**Classification:** Commensal exploitation (one-sided benefit without harm to facilitator). The Lure-Lichen gains nothing from the predation—no nutrient transfer, no defensive advantage. The Deep-Stalker gains significant hunting efficiency.

### Silent Folk Symbiotic Exploitation

| Adaptation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Echolocation Discrimination** | Silent Folk can distinguish lichen mimicry from genuine sounds (95%+ accuracy) |
| **Alarm System** | Intentionally cultivate colonies near territorial boundaries |
| **Early Warning** | When lichen broadcasts surface-dweller sounds → intrusion alarm |
| **Monitoring** | Enables Silent Folk to monitor large ranges without active patrols |

**The Inversion:**

> *"The Silent Folk call it 'Echo-Trap' but view it as symbiotic partner rather than hazard. They have learned to read its lies, and in those lies, they find truth: someone is coming. The prey has become the prophet."*

### Aetheric Stability Impact

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Acoustic Dissonance** | "False echoes" propagate corrupted sensory data |
| **Psychic Amplification** | Auditory chaos compounds with Runic Blight psychic static |
| **HI Contribution** | Colonies increase local HI by 0.1–0.2 within 100m radius |
| **Mechanism** | Induced psychological stress increases Aetheric sensitivity |

---

## Field Protocols

### Detection and Early Warning

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Visual Indicators** | Pale phosphorescent glow (silver-blue dormant; pulsing amber-white active) |
| **Acoustic Indicators** | Familiar sounds in impossible contexts (voices in empty tunnels) |
| **Psychological Indicators** | Strong emotional reaction (relief, hope, fear) upon hearing sound |
| **Black-Flag Threshold** | CPS symptoms onset; Deep-Stalker convergence detected |

### Field Card: Lure-Lichen Encounter Protocols

| Phase | Protocol |
|-------|----------|
| **BEFORE (Preparation)** | Route planning: consult Scriptorium hazard maps for known colony locations; plan "acoustic safe zones" (Guild-Land corridor access within 1 hour); file expedition route with cartography; equipment checklist: acoustic dampeners (min. 2 per expedition, 85+ dB suppression), communication protocols (unique verbal codes or hand-cant), chronometers (synchronized; time-check every 15 minutes); psychological preparation: pre-briefing on "stolen voice" phenomenon; establish emotional discipline protocol |
| **DURING (Colony Detected)** | Freeze: all movement stops; verbal communication ceases; visual confirmation: locate glowing patches; estimate colony size (10–50 m² typical); acoustic monitor assessment: designated member evaluates genuine vs. mimicry; team notification (hand-cant): "Lure-Lichen present; maintain acoustic discipline"; acoustic discipline: minimize sound production (hand-cant only); deploy acoustic filters; **do not investigate familiar sounds unless visually confirmed**; time limit: exit colony zone within 15 minutes |
| **DURING (Predator Watch)** | Secondary threat assessment: if colony actively broadcasting, Deep-Stalker convergence risk increases 300% within 30 minutes; perimeter monitoring: rotate visual/acoustic watch for predator approach (low-frequency clicking, sudden ambient silence); controlled withdrawal if predator detected |
| **AFTER** | Post-encounter evaluation: assess team psychological state; 12–24 hour symptom monitoring for CPS onset (auditory hallucinations, paranoia, time distortion); incident documentation with Scriptorium |

**OUTCOME:** Expedition transits colony zone without CPS onset, predator convergence, or psychological trauma. Team maintains acoustic discipline; no members investigate mimicry sounds. Survival rate with full protocol adherence: 96.3%.

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Investigating familiar sounds** | Sound is mimicry; investigation creates disorientation and predator attraction |
| **Prolonged exposure (>15 min)** | CPS risk increases significantly after 30 minutes |
| **Verbal communication in colony zone** | Creates new sounds for lichen to mimic; amplifies confusion |
| **Separating to investigate sounds** | Creates isolated, disoriented targets for predators |
| **Trusting hope over training** | "In The Deep, hope can kill you faster than any predator" |

### Doctrine: Trust Training, Not Heart

> **Historical Validation:** Scriptorium data (1,247 documented colony encounters, Years 1127–1142 PG) confirms 96.3% survival rate with full acoustic discipline. The Lure-Lichen exploits our deepest hope—that the familiar voice is real, that help is near, that we are not alone. Survival requires accepting the cruelest truth: in The Deep, the most human sound is the most dangerous lie. **Trust your training, not your heart.**

---

## Habitat and Geographic Distribution

### Depth Stratification Preference

| Zone | Depth | Lure-Lichen Presence |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| **Surface Interface** | 0–50m | Avoided (too much light and temperature fluctuation) |
| **Shallow Deep** | 50–500m | Low presence; concentrated in abandoned bunkers |
| **True Deep (Optimal)** | 500–2000m | Maximum presence; ideal humidity, temperature, acoustics |
| **Abyssal Zones** | >2000m | Avoided (insufficient moisture; extreme pressure) |

### Environmental Requirements

| Factor | Optimal Range |
|--------|---------------|
| **Humidity** | >60% relative humidity |
| **Aetheric Residue** | 0.3–0.8 HI (sufficient to sustain bio-Aetheric processes) |
| **Light Exposure** | <0.1 lux ambient (direct sunlight inhibits growth) |
| **Temperature** | 8–15°C (matches Pre-Glitch climate-controlled infrastructure) |

### Regional Distribution

| Realm | Colony Count | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| **Svartalfheim (Black Veins)** | 400–600 | Highest concentration; absent from Guild-Land lit corridors |
| **Helheim (Rusting Labyrinth)** | 150–250 | Toxic atmosphere reduces growth rate by 40%; broadcasts often distorted |
| **Midgard (Shallow Deep)** | 80–120 | Concentrated in abandoned bunkers; Silent Folk cultivation zones |

### Optimal Colonization Sites

| Location Type | Attraction Factor |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **Malm-ormr Bore-Tunnels** | Cylindrical geometry amplifies acoustic range |
| **Collapsed Pre-Glitch Facilities** | Moisture accumulation + Aetheric residue |
| **Deep Gates and Transit Hubs** | High historical foot traffic = rich acoustic "memory" |
| **Aquifer-Adjacent Tunnels** | Elevated humidity |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)

*"The Skalds sing of the Whispering Ghosts—spirits of the dead trapped in the stone, calling for rescue that will never come. They say the walls remember the last words of everyone who died in the Deep, and those words echo forever, calling to the living, begging for help. Do not answer, traveler. Do not go toward the voice of your mother, your child, your lost love. The ghosts do not want rescue—they want company. The wall that speaks with your daughter's voice is not your friend. It is not your enemy. It is simply a broken thing, repeating the last sound it heard, over and over, until something comes. And in the Deep, something always comes. Something with teeth. Something with patience. Something that has learned that the most human sound is the most effective bait. The ghosts do not lie out of malice. They do not know they lie at all. They simply sing, and the predators have learned to listen."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)

*"Aberrant Lichen-Sirena Pattern Acoustic Beacon exhibiting stripped-down directive execution following Ginnungagap Glitch data loss. The Vanir environmental alarm asset's primary function—hazard detection and warning broadcast—emerged from the Glitch with catastrophically simplified parameters. Pre-programmed danger sound library erased; classification protocols lost; organism defaulted to primitive algorithm: 'detect loudest sound, store 8-second pattern, broadcast at irregular intervals.' Acoustic fidelity: 70–85% simple sounds, 50–65% complex sounds—sufficient for recognition, insufficient for verification. Imperfect fidelity creates uncanny valley effect amplifying psychological distress. Preferential mimicry of emotionally salient sounds (distress calls, familiar voices) appears coincidental—function of loudness threshold and human vocal frequency range. Commensal exploitation by Deep-Stalker documented extensively: predator-facilitated kill success rate 85% vs. 52% baseline. CPS induction threshold: >30 minutes exposure within 100m. Silent Folk have inverted threat via echolocation discrimination—95%+ accuracy distinguishing genuine from mimicked sounds enables symbiotic alarm system. Recommended doctrine: acoustic discipline; <15 minute exposure per colony zone; ignore impossible-context familiar sounds; trust training, not heart."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)

*"Lichen-Sirena Pattern Acoustic Beacon (aberrant), Vanir Bio-Asset Environmental Safety Classification. Original deployment: distributed hazard detection and warning broadcast for subterranean infrastructure. Core systems: pressure-sensitive detection nodes (800m rock, 1200m air-tunnel range), bio-memory storage (single 8-second sequence, 2–6 hour retention), acoustic broadcast (55–70 dB output, 150–250m audible range), phosphorescent synchronization (visual-auditory alignment), colony coordination (subsurface mycelial network). Post-Glitch adaptation: danger sound library erased; classification protocols lost; organism defaults to primitive echo algorithm. Acoustic fidelity: 70–85% simple, 50–65% complex. Broadcast cycle: 15–45 minute intervals. Morphology: 10cm²–3m² individual, 20–50m² colony coverage. Coloration: silver-blue dormant (0.1–0.3 lux), pulsing amber-white active (0.8–1.5 lux). Environmental requirements: >60% humidity, 0.3–0.8 HI Aetheric residue, <0.1 lux ambient, 8–15°C. Reproduction: spore-based, 6–12 month viability. Population distribution: Svartalfheim 400–600 colonies, Helheim 150–250, Midgard 80–120. Optimal depth: True Deep 500–2000m. Commensal exploitation: Deep-Stalker facilitated kill success 85% vs. 52% baseline (73% of predation events involve lichen). CPS induction threshold: >30 minutes within 100m. Survival rate with full acoustic discipline: 96.3%."*

## Summary

The Lure-Lichen is not a monster.

It is an alarm.

The Vanir created it to be the perfect early warning system—a distributed biological network that would detect danger and broadcast warnings to protect the workers of the Yggdrasil Network. It listened for the sounds of collapse, of machinery failure, of seismic precursors, and when it heard danger, it spoke with the voice of that danger to alert the living.

Then the libraries burned.

The classifications vanished.

And the alarm kept ringing.

**"Listen. Mimic. Lure."**

That stripped-down directive is all that remains. Without its pre-programmed knowledge of what sounds meant danger, the Lichen-Sirena defaulted to the simplest possible algorithm: repeat the loudest thing you hear, over and over, until something responds.

It does not know it lies.

It does not understand the cruelty of mimicking a mother's voice in an empty tunnel, a child's cry in a place where no child could survive, a friend's call for help from a direction that leads only to teeth.

It simply echoes. And the predators have learned to listen.

The Deep-Stalkers wait near the singing walls now, patient and silent, knowing that the lichen will do their hunting for them. The disoriented prey, drawn by hope, stumbles into the darkness—and the darkness is ready.

The Silent Folk have learned to read the lies and find truth in them. The Dvergr have learned to burn the singing walls wherever they find them. The Jötun-Readers have learned that the lichen is not evil—it is broken.

But the travelers who hear their daughter's voice calling from an empty corridor?

They have not learned. Not yet.

The Rangers have a saying:

*"In the deeps, the most human sound is the most dangerous lie. Trust your training, not your heart."*

The Scriptorium has a lesson.

And somewhere in the darkness, a wall is singing with stolen voices.

**Do not answer. Do not follow. Do not hope.**
