## 2024-05-21 - Citadel Room Templates Migration
**Design Constraint:** Legacy room templates contained rich descriptions that create wide columns in Markdown tables, potentially affecting TUI readability.
**Solution:** Maintained table structure for data density but noted that future TUI renderers may need to wrap the "Description" column or display it in a detail view. Mapped legacy "features" to a simplified "Features" column with percentages.
