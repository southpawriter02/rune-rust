## WRITING GUIDELINES

### Skill Check Principles

1. **Attempt describes action** - what is the character doing?
2. **Struggle builds tension** - for significant checks
3. **Success feels earned** - not trivial
4. **Failure has dignity** - characters fail nobly, not stupidly
5. **Information is specific** - discoveries are concrete, not vague

### Examination Principles

1. **Layered revelation** - basic info, then details
2. **World-building integration** - discoveries connect to setting
3. **Actionable intelligence** - findings affect gameplay
4. **Sensory engagement** - describe what they observe
5. **Character skill matters** - high skill finds more

### Avoid

- Vague findings ("you notice something strange")
- Breaking character for exposition
- Every failure being embarrassing
- Every success being trivial
- Information without context
