# Arcane Implements

## A. Wands

| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Examples | Runic wand, Aether conduit, focus rod, channeling implement |
| Base Damage | 2d10 + WILL (arcane) |
| Range | Medium |
| Hands Required | One |
| Special Properties | [Arcane Focus] — Channels Galdr abilities; [AP Reduction] — Reduces ability costs by 5 AP |
| Proficiency Required | Arcane Implements Proficiency |
| Governing Attribute | WILL |

**Common Names (Layer 1):** Word-Stick, Rune-Finger, The Pointing Truth, Galdr-Guide

**Diagnostic Notes:** Wands serve as precision channeling implements for Galdr practitioners—the [AP Reduction] property represents the efficiency gains from proper energy focusing. Unlike staves (which offer defensive utility), wands optimize for pure arcane output. Rúnasmiðr favor wands for runic inscription work; the implement provides the fine control necessary for stable rune-crafting.

| Example Weapon | Tier | Damage | Value (PS) | Special |
|----------------|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Carved Bone Wand (Jury-Rigged) | 0 | 1d10 + WILL | 25 PS | Unstable; +5% Galdr failure rate |
| Salvaged Focus Rod (Scavenged) | 1 | 2d10 + WILL | 80 PS | [AP Reduction: 3] |
| Scriptorium Wand (Clan-Forged) | 2 | 2d10 + WILL | 250 PS | [AP Reduction: 5]; +1 WILL |
| Dvergr Channeling Wand (Dvergr-Forged) | 3 | 2d10+2 + WILL | 520 PS | [AP Reduction: 7]; Blight-resistant |
| Void Lens (Myth-Forged) | 5 | 3d10+3 + WILL | 8,800 PS | [AP Reduction: 10]; Aether regeneration; +4 WILL; critical Galdr effects enhanced |

## B. Orbs & Foci

| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Examples | Crystal orb, Aether sphere, focusing gem, memory-stone |
| Base Damage | 3d10 + WILL (arcane) |
| Range | Medium |
| Hands Required | One (or None — can float) |
| Special Properties | [Arcane Focus]; [Critical Enhancement] — Increases Galdr critical chance by 10%; [Hovering] — Does not occupy hand slot when attuned |
| Proficiency Required | Arcane Implements Proficiency |
| Governing Attribute | WILL |

**Common Names (Layer 1):** Seeing-Stone, Mind's Eye, The Floating Truth, Soul-Mirror

**Diagnostic Notes:** Orbs represent advanced arcane technology—focusing implements that attune to their wielder and operate semi-independently. The [Hovering] property reflects the orb's ability to float near the user once properly attuned, freeing the hand for other purposes. God-Sleeper resurrection researchers employ orbs extensively; the implements' resonance properties allegedly assist in consciousness-fragment detection.

| Example Weapon | Tier | Damage | Value (PS) | Special |
|----------------|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Flawed Crystal (Jury-Rigged) | 0 | 1d10 + WILL | 40 PS | Requires hand; no special properties |
| Salvaged Focus Gem (Scavenged) | 1 | 3d10 + WILL | 120 PS | [Critical Enhancement: 5%] |
| Rune-Cut Orb (Clan-Forged) | 2 | 3d10 + WILL | 350 PS | [Critical Enhancement: 10%]; [Hovering] |
| Dvergr Precision Sphere (Dvergr-Forged) | 3 | 3d10+2 + WILL | 700 PS | [Critical Enhancement: 15%]; [Hovering]; +2 WILL |
| All-Rune's Eye (Myth-Forged) | 5 | 4d10+4 + WILL | 13,500 PS | [Critical Enhancement: 20%]; [Hovering]; +5 WILL; can cast two Galdr abilities per turn |
