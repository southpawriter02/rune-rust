## Overview

| Attribute | Value |

| **Ability Type** | Passive |
| **Tier** | 2 (Advanced) |
| **PP Cost** | 4 / 4 / 4 |
| **Prerequisite** | 8 PP invested in Ruin-Stalker tree |

## Thematic Description

> *"You've trained your mind against the paradoxes. The looped whispers, the recursive visions, the semantic drift—you've built walls against them all."*
> 

**Cognitive Paradox Syndrome (CPS)** is the occupational hazard of ruin work. Prolonged exposure to Old World anomalies breaks minds in predictable ways. The Ruin-Stalker has developed mental disciplines—breathing techniques, cognitive anchors, reality-checking protocols—that provide **resistance to these effects**.

## Mechanical Implementation

### Base Effect (Rank 1)

- +1d10 bonus to **Resolve checks** vs Psychic Stress from:
    - Anomalies
    - Old World systems
    - CPS-inducing environments
- Reduce **Psychic Stress gained** from anomaly exposure by **2**

### Rank 2

- +2d10 bonus (up from +1d10)
- Reduce Stress by **4** (up from 2)
- **Immune** to Stage 1 CPS precursors
- **PP Cost**: 4

### Rank 3

- +3d10 bonus
- Reduce Stress by **6**
- **Immune** to Stage 1, **Resistant** to Stage 2
- **Silent Room Protocol**: Can use on allies to remove **1d6 Psychic Stress**
- **PP Cost**: 4

## CPS Stages Reference

| Stage | Symptoms | Your Resistance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Stage 1 (Precursors)** | Auditory paresthesia, semantic drift, looped prosody, fixation | Immune at Rank 2+ |
| **Stage 2 (Active)** | Hallucinations, time distortion, identity bleed | Resistant at Rank 3 |
| **Stage 3 (Critical)** | Reality dissociation, permanent cognitive damage | No immunity (abort required) |

---

## CPS Hygiene Protocols

Ruin-Stalkers maintain strict protocols to prevent CPS accumulation:

| Protocol | Description | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Entry Window** | 15-30 min max first entry | Limits exposure |
| **Rotation Cadence** | Rotate lead observer every 12 min | Distributes Stress |
| **Abort Criteria** | Any two Stage 1 precursors | Mandatory exit |
| **Silent Room** | Dim • Dampen • De-pattern • Document | Recovery protocol |

---

## Silent Room Protocol (Rank 3)

Can be performed on allies during rest:

- **Cost**: 10 minutes of uninterrupted care
- **Effect**: Remove 1d6 Psychic Stress from target
- **Limit**: Once per ally per rest period
- **Requirements**: Dim lighting, quiet environment

---

## Synergies

### Internal (Ruin-Stalker Tree)

- **Anomaly Sense I**: Detection reduces unexpected exposure
- **Anomaly Exploitation**: CPS Resistance protects during manipulation
- **Corridor Maker**: Capstone grants party your CPS bonuses

### External (Party Composition)

- **Bone-Setter**: Medical CPS treatment complements your protocols
- **Low-WILL characters**: Benefit from your Silent Room care
- **Extended ruin expeditions**: Your resistance enables longer operations

---

## v5.0 Compliance Notes

✅ **Trauma Economy**: CPS is core environmental hazard system

✅ **Layer 2 Voice**: Professional protocols and medical terminology

✅ **Team Utility**: Rank 3 Silent Room benefits allies

✅ **Realistic Progression**: Stage immunity reflects training, not supernatural immunity
