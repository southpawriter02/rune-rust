# The Strandhögg — The Exploiter of the System Crash

> *"You see the battlefield stuttering and you think: danger. You think: take cover until the glitch resolves. I see opportunity. I see the exact moment when their command structure is speaking into silence, when their formation is mid-hand-off, when their attention is fractured between the horror in front of them and the lag in their own reflexes. That's when I move. Approach quiet. Breach sudden. Strike when they're looking the wrong way. Exit before echoes resolve. The others fight the broken world. I weaponize it."*

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Warrior |
| **Role** | Opportunistic Finisher / Glitch-Raider / Kill-Chain Specialist |
| **Path Type** | Coherent (edge-walking; Heretical capstone) |
| **Primary Attribute** | FINESSE |
| **Secondary Attribute** | MIGHT |
| **Resource System** | Stamina + Pace |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | Low (capstone costs Psychic Stress + Corruption) |

The **Strandhögg** is the Warrior specialization that embodies the philosophy of the **exploiter of the system crash**.[^]

They are not disciplined duelists or unyielding tanks; they are **glitch-raiders**—predators who have learned to thrive in the chaotic, flickering rhythm of a broken reality. Their art is one of brutal efficiency and overwhelming kinetic violence: strike when the system lags, kill when a foe is disoriented by a reality-glitch, and never, ever stop moving.

To choose the Strandhögg is to embrace the fantasy of the savage opportunist and the lightning-fast finisher. Your saga is a chronicle of brutal, kinetic violence, told in the calculus of exploiting every opening and ending every fight before the world has a chance to glitch against you. Hesitation is a fatal error in a system that could crash at any second. You are the tide that cannot be stopped, the raider who turns a single kill into a cascade of carnage.

## Core Philosophy: The Doctrine of the Raid

### The Tide-Knife's Creed

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Approach Quiet** | Routes planned, hooks ready, smoke prepared |
| **Breach Sudden** | Strike compromised targets first |
| **Exploit Instability** | Capitalize on fear, confusion, stillness |
| **Exit Before Echoes Resolve** | Vanish before the system catches up |

The Strandhögg's philosophy is rooted in a dark truth about post-Glitch Aethelgard: **the world itself is broken, and the broken can be exploited**.[^] Where others see chaos and horror in reality's stuttering, the Strandhögg sees tactical opportunity.

> *"The old warriors fought in a stable world. Their formations held because physics held. Their command structures worked because signals propagated predictably. But the Glitch changed everything. Now reality lags. Now attention fractures. Now there are moments—brief, precious moments—when the enemy is looking at a ghost of where I was, not where I am. I live in those moments. I kill in those moments."*

Their combat doctrine is not about fair fights or prolonged engagements—it's about **attention craft**. Confuse the ear and blind the eye; your work succeeds when command speaks into silence.

### The Art of the Raid

| Stage | Method |
|-------|--------|
| **Before the Tide** | Identify priority targets; plan routes and exits |
| **On Approach** | Count the beats; watch for relay hand-offs and ritual clocks |
| **At Breach** | Strike when they're looking the wrong way; build Pace |
| **Execution** | Harvest weakened enemies; chain kills with No Quarter |
| **Withdrawal** | Harrier's Whirlwind out; vanish before echoes resolve |

The Strandhögg operates on the principle that **you don't start fights—you end them**.[^] Maximum damage against already-compromised targets: [Feared], [Stunned], [Confused], [Disoriented]. Any target whose rhythm is broken.

> *"The duelist waits for a worthy opponent. The berserker wades into the thick. I wait for the moment of fracture—the gap between command and execution, the stutter when reality hiccups—and then I move. By the time they've processed that I'm there, I'm already gone. By the time they've processed that I'm gone, their champion is dead."*[^]

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Unstoppable raider who exploits glitches and weaknesses for cascading kill chains |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Fast-paced, aggressive, highly mobile cleanup specialist |
| **Success Metric** | Kill-chains; Pace management; exploiting debuffed enemies |
| **Decision Space** | Target prioritization; timing executions; managing Pace decay |

Playing a Strandhögg is about **relentless momentum and opportunistic violence**.[^]

Your operational loop is:
1. **Approach**: Start combat with Pace from Harrier's Alacrity
2. **Breach**: Use Dread Charge to gap-close and apply [Disoriented]
3. **Build**: Generate Pace through movement and Reaver's Strike
4. **Exploit**: Use Vicious Flank for massive damage against debuffed targets
5. **Execute**: Savage Harvest wounded enemies for resource refunds
6. **Chain**: No Quarter grants free movement to next target—repeat

> *"My combat pattern is constant flow. Move to generate Pace. Strike to build more. Exploit debuffed enemies for bonus damage. Execute weakened targets. Use the momentum of each kill to fuel the next. Every successful kill grants free movement—I'm already repositioned for the next throat before the first body hits the ground. When played correctly, I become an unstoppable tide of violence sweeping across the battlefield."*

You're not a frontline tank—you're a **finisher who dives in to secure kills**, chaining from one weakened foe to the next.

### The Trade-Off

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Devastating kill-chain potential | Setup-dependent (needs ally debuffs) |
| High mobility and repositioning | Struggles in single-boss fights |
| Exploits chaos and control effects | Control effects shut down Pace engine |
| Rewards aggressive, constant action | Pace decay punishes hesitation |
| Multi-target cleanup excellence | Capstone costs Psychic Stress + Corruption |

The Strandhögg is **dominant in multi-target scenarios** but pays for it with vulnerability to control and single-target encounters.[^]

> *"Yes, I need chaos. Yes, I need targets already softened by controllers. Yes, I struggle against a single boss with no adds to chain through. That's the trade-off. I'm not built for prolonged duels or attrition warfare. I'm built for the breach—the moment when the enemy formation cracks and someone needs to pour through that gap like a flood. Point me at the fracture. Let me end it."*

## Core Mechanics: The Three Pillars

### Pillar 1: The Pace Resource System

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Scale** | 0 to 100 Pace |
| **Starting Value** | 15-35 (via Harrier's Alacrity) |
| **Generation** | Movement (+5/tile), attacks (+10-15), exploiting debuffs (+15) |
| **Decay** | -10 at end of turn with no motion or contact |

**Pace** is the foundational mechanic—the kinetic resonance that fuels the Strandhögg's power.[^]

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│             PACE RESOURCE                   │

├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│  GENERATION:                                │

│  • Movement: +5 Pace per tile moved         │

│  • Clean strike: +10 Pace                   │

│  • Exploit fear/confusion/stillness: +15   │

│                                             │

│  THRESHOLDS:                                │

│  • 25 Pace: Surge ready                     │

│  • 50 Pace: Whirlwind window                │

│  • 75 Pace: Riptide prep                    │

│  • 100 Pace: Execution peak                 │

│                                             │

│  DECAY:                                     │

│  • -10 at end of turn with no action        │

│  • Rapid decay out-of-combat                │

│  • Reset to 0 on rest                       │

│                                             │

│  "Standing still means losing power."       │

│                                             │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

> *"Pace isn't just a resource—it's a philosophy made manifest. The universe rewards motion. Stop moving, start dying. Every tile I cross charges the engine. Every strike builds the wave. Every debuffed enemy I exploit adds fuel to the tide. And when I stop? When I hesitate? The Pace bleeds away. The world punishes stillness. So I never stop."*[^]

### Pillar 2: Exploiting System Instability

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Massive damage bonuses against debuffed enemies |
| **Vicious Flank** | +2d8 damage per negative status effect on target |
| **Tidal Rush** | +5-12 Pace when enemies gain debuffs |
| **Dread Charge** | Applies [Disoriented] to set up exploitation |

**Exploiting System Instability** is the combat mechanic—the predatory capitalization on enemy weakness.[^]

| Target Status | Vicious Flank Bonus |
|---------------|---------------------|
| 0 debuffs | Base damage only |
| 1 debuff | +2d8 bonus damage |
| 2 debuffs | +4d8 bonus damage |
| 3+ debuffs | +6d8 bonus damage (auto-crit at Rank 3) |

> *"I am an opportunistic predator. I don't create the chaos—I exploit it. When the Hlekkr-master roots an enemy, when the Thul shatters their confidence, when the Skald's dissonance leaves them [Disoriented]—that's when I move. Every debuff on a target is a multiplier. Three debuffs? My Vicious Flank becomes an execution. The allies soften; I finish."*

### Pillar 3: Kill-Chaining

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Kills refund resources and grant free movement |
| **Savage Harvest** | On kill: heal HP + generate Pace + next ability costs no Pace |
| **No Quarter** | On kill: immediate free movement (4-6 tiles) |
| **Combined Effect** | Each kill fuels the next; cascade potential |

**Kill-Chaining** is the execution mechanic—the transformation of a single breach into a total rout.[^]

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│            KILL-CHAIN FLOW                  │

│  ├─ Heal 20-30 HP                           │

│  ├─ Generate 40 Pace                        │

│  └─ No Quarter: Free move to Target B       │

│                                             │

│  KILL TARGET B:                             │

│  ├─ Resources refunded again                │

│  ├─ Heal again                              │

│  ├─ Pace maintained at high levels          │

│  └─ No Quarter: Free move to Target C       │

│                                             │

│  RESULT: Cascade of violence where each     │

│  kill fuels the next until field is clear   │

│                                             │

│  "A finish begins the next approach."       │

│                                             │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

> *"The first kill is an investment. The second is profit. By the third, I'm operating at pure efficiency—each execution refunding its cost, each death repositioning me for the next. When the chain is flowing, I'm not spending resources; I'm harvesting them. The enemy formation doesn't collapse—it evaporates."*[^]

| Rank 1 | 15 | +1 | — |
| Rank 2 | 25 | +2 | — |
| Rank 3 | 35 | +2 | First attack has advantage |

> *"Lives coiled for motion. The others enter combat at rest, building from nothing. I enter already in stride, already seeing first openings, already planning the first three moves. By the time they've oriented, I've already struck."*

**Reaver's Strike** is the core Pace generator—the swift test-stroke that establishes pressure.[^]

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cost | 30 Stamina |
| Damage | 2d8 Physical (FINESSE-based) |
| Pace Generation | +10 (Rank 1), +15 (Rank 2) |
| Rank 3 Bonus | +2d6 damage vs targets with any negative status |

> *"A swift test-stroke to probe guard and set rhythm. I'm not trying to kill with this—I'm building the wave. Every hit charges the engine. By the third Reaver's Strike, I'm at execution threshold."*

**Dread Charge** is the gap-closer—the fierce cry and blur forward that rattles frayed minds.[^]

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cost | 35 Stamina |

| Rank 3 | On successful Disorientation, generate 20 Pace |

> *"I come from nowhere. One moment I'm in the back rank; the next I'm in their face, blade already moving. The charge itself is a weapon—presence alone rattles minds that are already frayed by the world's stutter. They flinch. They hesitate. They become [Disoriented]. And then Vicious Flank ends them."*

### Tier 2 — Advanced Skirmishing

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Vicious Flank** | Active | 40 Stamina | Massive damage vs debuffed targets (+2d8 per debuff) |

| Bonus Damage | +2d8 per status effect (max +6d8) |
| Rank 3 | Auto-crit against targets with 3+ status effects |

> *"Walks the edge of a foe's failing code. When minds stumble or bodies stutter, I'm already there. The [Disoriented] enemy, the [Rooted] enemy, the [Feared] enemy—they're not opponents anymore. They're resources. Each debuff on them adds to my damage. Three debuffs? That's not a fight. That's a harvest."*

**Harrier's Whirlwind** is the hit-and-run ability—strike and vanish on the same breath.[^]

| Cost | 45 Stamina + 20 Pace |
| Damage | 3d10 Physical |
| After Attack | Immediately move 3-4 tiles without provoking opportunity attacks |
| Rank 3 | If attack kills target, Pace cost refunded |

> *"Strike and vanish on the same breath. I hit, I move, I'm gone before they can counter. The others trade blows until exhaustion; I refuse to be where the return strike lands. Repositioning without inviting a counter—that's the art."*

**Tidal Rush** is the synergy passive—momentum compounds when control falters.[^]

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Trigger | Enemy within 6 tiles gains any negative status effect |
| Generation | +5 Pace (Rank 2: +8; Rank 3: +12) |
| Rank 2 Bonus | Also triggers when enemy fails a save |
| Rank 3 Bonus | At 75+ Pace, your attacks gain +1 bonus die |

> *"Each visible system error in the foe feeds my pace. The Hlekkr-master roots an enemy—I feel it, I gain momentum. The Thul breaks their will—I feel that too. My allies aren't just controlling the field; they're charging my engine. Momentum compounds when control falters."*

### Tier 3 — Mastery of the Kill

| Damage | 6d10 Physical (Rank 2: 8d10) |
| On Kill | Heal 20-30 HP; generate 40 Pace; next ability costs no Pace |

> *"A decisive finishing sequence meant to close the ledger on a marked target. When the mark falls, breath and pace return in kind. This isn't just a kill—it's an investment. The execution refunds everything. The healing keeps me in the fight. The Pace surge prepares the next strike. Kill begets kill."*

**No Quarter** is the repositioning passive—a cleared lane grants immediate movement.[^]

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Trigger | You kill an enemy |
| Effect | Immediately move up to 4 tiles (no action cost) |
| Rank 2 | Move up to 6 tiles; doesn't provoke opportunity attacks |

## Systemic Integration

### Combat Role: The Finisher

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Primary Function** | Opportunistic cleanup; kill-chain specialist; momentum striker |
| **Power Source** | Coherent raider doctrine with Heretical capstone |
| **Unique Contribution** | Only specialization built around cascading kill-chains |

The Strandhögg is the **finisher**.[^] They don't start the chaos—they end it decisively. They clear marked threats already shaken by control effects; close loops so the field calms. While allies apply debuffs and control the battlefield, the Strandhögg pours through the gaps like a flood.

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Coherent (edge-walking) with Heretical capstone |
| **Psychic Stress** | Dread Charge inflicts ~10 on target; Riptide inflicts ~15-20 on self |
| **Corruption** | Riptide of Carnage costs +5 permanent Runic Blight Corruption |
| **Campaign Arc** | Reliable momentum warrior until capstone use accumulates consequences |

The Strandhögg is **primarily coherent**—their raider doctrine is tactical, not heretical.[^] But their ultimate power involves weaponizing reality glitches directly, creating a dangerous interface with the world's brokenness. Using the capstone is a significant decision with long-term consequences.

> *"Most of what I do is pure skill—reading the battlefield, timing the breach, chaining kills through momentum. No corruption, no dark bargains. But Riptide? That's different. That's stepping into the glitch itself, letting the world's brokenness flow through me to strike faster than physics should allow. And some of that brokenness stays. The Stress. The Corruption. The price for weaponizing entropy. Reserve it for when the alternative is worse."*

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Controllers (Hlekkr-master, etc.)** | Seed fear, confusion, or stillness for Strandhögg to exploit |
| **Thul (Debuffer)** | Mental debuffs set up Vicious Flank's massive damage bonus |
| **Skjaldmær** | Hold the breach while raids execute; protect during Pace building |
| **Skald** | Tempo manipulation feeds Pace generation |
| **Jötun-Reader** | HP revelation enables perfect Savage Harvest timing |
| **Other Skirmishers** | Wolf-pack lanes to unmake command nets |

**Negative Synergies:**

| Situation | Issue |
|-----------|-------|
| **Slow, methodical specialists** | Strandhögg wants fast, aggressive fights |
| **Other finishers** | Competing for same low-HP targets |
| **Single-boss parties** | Kill-chains don't trigger without multiple targets |
| **Defensive formations** | Constant movement disrupts coordinated positioning |

### Situational Power Profile

| Condition | Performance |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Optimal** | Multiple weakened enemies; parties with controllers; cleanup phases |
| **Weak** | Single-boss fights; control-heavy enemies; attrition battles |
| **Hard Counters** | Swarms of weak enemies; debuffed targets; clustered formations |
| **Hard Countered By** | [Root], [Stun]; single high-HP bosses; anti-mobility effects |

## Combat Loop Example

### The Cascade
TURN 1: BREACH

├─ Start with 20 Pace (Harrier's Alacrity)

├─ Dread Charge → Gap-close 4 tiles

├─ Attack Priority Target A

├─ [Disoriented] applied (WILL save failed)

└─ Current Pace: 30 (start + charge)

TURN 2: BUILD

├─ Reaver's Strike on [Disoriented] Target A

├─ +15 Pace (attack) + +10 Pace (Tidal Rush debuff bonus)

├─ Target A at ~60% HP

└─ Current Pace: 55

TURN 3: EXPLOIT

├─ Vicious Flank on [Disoriented] Target A

├─ 4d8 + 2d8 (one debuff) = 6d8 damage

├─ Cost: 40 Stamina (no Pace cost at this rank)

├─ Target A at ~25% HP

└─ Current Pace: 55 (maintained)

TURN 4: BUILD TO THRESHOLD

├─ Move 2 tiles (+10 Pace)

├─ Reaver's Strike (+15 Pace)

└─ Current Pace: 80 (execution threshold)

TURN 5: EXECUTE & CHAIN

├─ Savage Harvest on Target A (below 50% HP)

├─ 6d10 damage → KILL CONFIRMED

├─ Heal 20 HP; Generate 40 Pace

├─ No Quarter triggers → Free move 4 tiles to Target B

├─ Target B already [Feared] from ally

└─ Current Pace: 80+ (refunded + generated)

TURN 6: CHAIN CONTINUES

├─ Vicious Flank on [Feared] Target B

├─ Massive damage → Target B at ~40% HP

├─ Savage Harvest → KILL CONFIRMED

├─ Heal again; Pace refunded

├─ No Quarter → Free move to Target C

└─ RESULT: Two kills, positioned for third

LATE FIGHT: RIPTIDE

├─ At 80+ Pace, 3+ enemies remain

├─ Activate Riptide of Carnage

├─ 2 Standard Actions per turn for 2-3 rounds

├─ Movement is free

├─ All attacks +2d6 damage

├─ Clear remaining enemies in cascade

├─ Accept +15 Stress, +5 Corruption

└─ RESULT: Battlefield swept clean

## Lore Integration

### The Philosophy of the Raid

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Heritage** | Pre-Glitch littoral raiders adapted to reality fractures |
| **Philosophy** | The broken world is a weapon to those who understand it |
| **Method** | Attention craft; signal suppression; timed breaching |
| **Status** | Feared for effectiveness; watched for instability |

The Strandhögg tradition evolved from pre-Glitch coastal raiders who specialized in **littoral operations**—signal suppression, relay decapitation, timed breaching.[^] After the Glitch fractured reality, these warriors discovered that their doctrine translated perfectly to the new world's chaos. Where others froze in horror at stuttering Undying and flickering landscapes, the Strandhögg saw the same patterns they'd exploited for generations: attention fracture, command lag, opportunity windows.

> *"Before the Glitch, we raided during storms—when visibility was low, when signals were confused, when command structures were speaking into silence. After the Glitch, we realized the whole world had become one endless storm. Reality itself stutters now. Attention fractures constantly. The lag between perception and reaction is measured in heartbeats. We didn't need to change our doctrine. The world changed to match it."*

### The Sacred Storm-Raid

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Tide, Fog, Ritual Clocks** | Enter on the off-beat; strike during hand-offs |
| **Attention Craft** | Confuse the ear and blind the eye |
| **The Off-Beat** | Success when command speaks into silence |
| **Keep an Exit Named** | Always know withdrawal route before breach |

The Strandhögg's methods have taken on an almost ritualistic quality—the "sacred storm-raid" that treats battlefield chaos as a kind of liturgy.[^]

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Hólmgangr Orders** | Disdain; "No honor in attacking compromised foes" |
| **Skjaldmær Companies** | Appreciation; "They clear what we contain" |
| **Controllers** | Partnership; "We setup, they execute" |
| **Jötun-Readers** | Interest; "Their exploitation of lag has measurable efficiency" |
| **Common Soldiers** | Awe and unease; "They move like the glitches themselves" |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the fractured realms of Aethelgard, where reality stutters and command speaks into silence, the Strandhögg emerges as the sacred tide-knife—the raider who has learned to weaponize the world's brokenness. They do not fight against chaos; they ride it. Their doctrine is ancient, adapted from the storm-raids of the old world to the endless glitch-storms of the new: approach quiet, breach sudden, exploit instability, exit before echoes resolve. They build Pace through relentless motion—momentum that bleeds away if they stop, that surges when enemies falter under control effects. They are finishers who end what others begin, pouring through gaps created by controllers to chain kills in cascading violence. Each execution fuels the next; each death repositions for another. At the height of their power, they can enter the Riptide—de-synchronizing from common rhythm to strike as if from several places at once. But this ultimate expression costs a piece of their mind and soul, staining them with the same corruption they exploit. They are not heroes who restore order; they are predators who have made peace with chaos. Their saga is written in the calculus of exploited openings and perfect timing. Do not duel for pride. Pick on fractures and leave."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Strandhögg (Glitch-Raider) represents the coherent Warrior specialization optimized for momentum-based burst damage and kill-chaining. Mechanical role: opportunistic finisher and multi-target cleanup specialist. Core mechanics: Pace Resource System (0-100 scale, generated through movement and attacks, decays with inaction, spent on high-impact abilities), Exploiting System Instability (Vicious Flank deals +2d8 per debuff on target, Tidal Rush generates Pace when enemies gain debuffs), and Kill-Chaining (Savage Harvest refunds resources on kill, No Quarter grants free movement to next target). Key differentiator: only specialization built around cascading execution chains; excels in multi-target cleanup scenarios; synergizes powerfully with controller allies. Signature ability: Riptide of Carnage (2-3 rounds of extra actions and bonus damage, costs +15 Psychic Stress and +5 permanent Corruption). Trauma Economy integration: Low until capstone; primarily coherent raider doctrine; Heretical capstone creates accumulating consequences with repeated use. Social function: feared for effectiveness in cleanup roles; watched for instability markers; valued for ability to end fights decisively. Optimal deployment: post-controller cleanup; multi-target encounters; parties with debuff specialists; scenarios requiring rapid kill-chains."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Strandhögg (Glitch-Raider). ARCHETYPE: Warrior. PATH TYPE: Coherent (edge-walking) with Heretical capstone. ROLE: Opportunistic Finisher / Kill-Chain Specialist / Momentum Striker. PRIMARY STAT: FINESSE. SECONDARY STAT: MIGHT. RESOURCE: Stamina + Pace (0-100). CORE MECHANICS: Pace Resource System (generated by movement +5/tile, attacks +10-15, exploiting debuffs +15; decays -10/turn without action; spent on abilities 20-80 range), Exploiting System Instability (Vicious Flank +2d8/debuff on target max +6d8, Tidal Rush +5-12 Pace when enemies gain debuffs, Dread Charge applies [Disoriented]), Kill-Chaining (Savage Harvest on kill heals 20-30 HP + generates 40 Pace + next ability free, No Quarter grants 4-6 tile free movement on any kill). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Raiding): Harrier's Alacrity I (passive, start with 15-35 Pace, +1-2 Initiative), Reaver's Strike (30 Stamina, FINESSE 2d8-3d8, +10-15 Pace), Dread Charge (35 Stamina, move 4-6 tiles, 2d10, target WILL DC 12-14 or [Disoriented]). T2 (Advanced Skirmishing): Vicious Flank (40 Stamina, 4d8-5d8 + 2d8-3d8 per debuff, auto-crit at 3+ debuffs Rank 3), Harrier's Whirlwind (45 Stamina + 20 Pace, 3d10-4d10, free 3-4 tile movement after), Tidal Rush (passive, +5-12 Pace when enemies within 6 tiles gain debuffs). T3 (Mastery of the Kill): Savage Harvest (50 Stamina + 30 Pace, requires target below 50-60% HP, 6d10-8d10, on kill heal 20-30 + 40 Pace + next ability free), No Quarter (passive, on kill free 4-6 tile movement, Rank 3 +3d6 to next attack). CAPSTONE: Riptide of Carnage (60 Stamina + 80 Pace, 2-3 rounds [Riptide] state: extra Standard Action, free movement, +2d6-3d6 damage; costs +12-15 Psychic Stress, +3-5 permanent Corruption; Rank 3 cleanses Stress if 3+ kills during Riptide). TRAUMA ECONOMY: Low until capstone; Dread Charge inflicts ~10 Stress on target; Riptide self-inflicts Stress + Corruption."*

## Summary

The Strandhögg is the **exploiter of the system crash**.

They are Warriors who have learned to weaponize chaos itself—glitch-raiders who thrive in the stuttering, flickering rhythm of post-Glitch Aethelgard. While others freeze in horror at reality's fractures, the Strandhögg moves between the frames, striking when command speaks into silence.

Their gameplay is **momentum-based kill-chaining**. They build Pace through relentless motion and successful attacks, exploit debuffed enemies for massive damage bonuses through Vicious Flank, and execute weakened targets with Savage Harvest to refund resources and reposition via No Quarter. When the chain is flowing, each kill fuels the next until the field is swept clean.

Their unique mechanic is **synergy with controllers**. The Strandhögg doesn't start the chaos—they end it. Allies apply [Disoriented], [Feared], [Stunned], [Rooted]; the Strandhögg pours through those gaps like a flood, converting debuffs into damage multipliers and fractured formations into kill opportunities.

The capstone Riptide of Carnage represents their ultimate expression—de-synchronizing from common rhythm to strike as if from several places at once. It costs Psychic Stress and permanent Corruption. It's reserved for when ending the fight ends the day.

This is the fantasy of the **savage opportunist who has made peace with chaos**—not a hero who restores order, but a predator who exploits disorder.

*"Approach quiet. Breach sudden. Exploit instability. Exit before echoes resolve."*
*"Do not duel for pride; pick on fractures and leave."*
*"Hesitation is a fatal error in a system that could crash at any second."*
