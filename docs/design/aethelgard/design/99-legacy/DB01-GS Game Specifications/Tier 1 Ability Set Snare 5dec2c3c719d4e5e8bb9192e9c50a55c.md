## Core Identity

Using sinew, wire, and scavenged materials, you quickly assemble a simple but effective snare trap, concealing it beneath corrupted earth or rubble. **It's not elegant engineering—it's pragmatic hunter's craft** born from years of tracking prey through hostile wilderness.

## Mechanics

### Cost

20 Stamina | **Standard Action** | **Components:** 1× [Scrap Metal] + 1× [Tough Leather]

### Effect

- Create and place concealed trap on target tile (within 2 tiles)
- First enemy to step on trap: Apply **[Rooted]** for 2 turns
- **[Rooted]:** Target cannot move from current position (can still attack)
- Trap remains active until triggered or combat ends
- Multiple traps can be placed (one per Standard Action)

### Rank Progression

| Rank | PP Cost | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | [Rooted] 1 turn |
| 2 | 20 | [Rooted] 2 turns, max 2 active traps |
| 3 | Capstone | [Rooted] 3 turns, +2d6 damage on trigger |

## Tactical Applications

**Battlefield Control:**

- Create control zones that force enemy movement choices
- Protect back row by trapping approach paths
- Lock high-priority targets in position for focused fire

**Synergies:**

- **Predator's Focus:** Works best when enemies can't reach you
- **Exploit Corruption:** Controlled targets easier to crit
- **Aimed Shot:** Trapped enemies are stationary targets
