#### Mastered (Specialist Insight — Jötun-Reader)

*All Complete content, plus:*

> **TACTICAL NOTES** *(Jötun-Reader Insight)*
>
> Analysis of the core logic reveals a critical flaw in its power regulation subroutine. A powerful electrical surge has a high probability of causing a catastrophic system reboot, manifesting as the **[Stunned]** status for 2 turns.
>
> Additionally, the targeting priority matrix favors the nearest threat. This behavior can be exploited: present a sacrificial target (such as a summoned construct) to draw its attention while flanking.
>
> *Hidden Ability:* **Overload Discharge** — When destroyed, releases electrical burst (1d6 Lightning damage, 2m radius). Savvy scavengers stand back when delivering the killing blow.

### Lore Fragments

#### Fragment 1 of 3 — Specimen

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Capture ID** | `cap-servitor-001` |
| **Type** | Specimen |
| **Title** | "Servitor Chassis Analysis" |
| **Source** | Examination of defeated Rusted Servitor |
| **Quality** | Standard |
| **Placement** | Examine any Rusted Servitor corpse |

**Content:**
> The outer casing is standard Dvergr industrial alloy—designed for durability rather than combat. The joints show severe oxidation, suggesting this unit has been operating far beyond its maintenance cycle. Internal components are surprisingly intact; the Iron Heart at its core continues to pulse weakly.
>
> This was a labor unit, not a warrior. It fights because its programming has degraded to base security protocols: "Identify Threat. Eliminate Threat." It doesn't know why. It just does.

#### Fragment 2 of 3 — Text Fragment

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Capture ID** | `cap-servitor-002` |
| **Type** | Text Fragment |
| **Title** | "Model 7 Production Manifest" |
| **Source** | Data-slate, Dvergr workshop |
| **Quality** | Enhanced |
| **Placement** | Readable object in Nidavellir industrial zone |

**Content:**
> *"Model 7 Utility Servitors — Production Batch 4,892*
>
> *Purpose: Mining support, cargo transport, basic security*
> *Units Produced: 2.3 million*
> *Expected Lifespan: 400 years (with maintenance)*
> *Status: DISCONTINUED*
>
> *Note from Foreman Dvalin: 'The Model 7s were never meant for combat. They're workhorses, not warhorses. But when the Glitch hit, they defaulted to threat-response protocols. Now they defend empty mines against 'intruders' that have been dead for seven centuries. Tragic, really. They're still trying to do their jobs.'"*

#### Fragment 3 of 3 — Oral History (Jötun-Reader)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Capture ID** | `cap-servitor-003` |
| **Type** | Oral History |
| **Title** | "The Reader's Assessment" |
| **Source** | Specialist analysis |
| **Quality** | Specialist |
| **Placement** | Requires Jötun-Reader specialization |

**Content:**
> "The Servitors are what happen when you build too well. The Dvergr made them to last forever, and by the ancestors, they succeeded. Seven hundred years later, they're still patrolling the same corridors, guarding the same empty rooms, attacking the same 'unauthorized personnel.'
>
> "The trick with a Servitor is understanding its priorities. It follows a simple logic chain: Patrol. Detect. Assess. Respond. If you can interrupt that chain—say, with a strong electrical pulse to scramble its assessment protocols—you get a window. A long window. Their reboot sequence takes nearly a full minute.
>
> "Of course, you have to survive the electrical discharge when they go down. Nothing's free in the ruins."

#### Partial (Basic Examination — WITS DC 12)

> **FORLORN WANDERER**
> *Classification: Undying | Psychic Anomaly*
> *Corruption Level: N/A (Non-corporeal)*
>
> **DESCRIPTION**
> A glitching, human-shaped effigy composed of crackling static and pale, shifting light. Often frozen in the posture of a command throne, hands reaching for controls that no longer exist. The air around it shimmers and tears.

#### Complete (Expert Examination — WITS DC 18)

> **FORLORN WANDERER**
> *Classification: Undying | Psychic Anomaly | Uncommon*
> *Corruption Level: N/A (Non-corporeal entity)*
>
> **DESCRIPTION**
> The psychic death-echo of an Einherjar pilot, imprinted on the Aether at the moment of the Ginnungagap Glitch. It is not sentient—it is a recording stuck in permanent loop, endlessly reliving its final moment of dissolution.
>
> **COMBAT DATA**
> | Stat | Value |
> |------|-------|
> | HP | N/A |
> | Physical Form | None (cannot be targeted by physical attacks) |
> | Broadcast Radius | 15-30 meters |
> | Damage Type | Psychic Stress per turn |
>

>
> **VULNERABILITIES**
> Psychic Damage (only damage type that affects them), Aetheric Disruption
>
> **IMMUNITIES**
> All status effects (non-corporeal)
>
> **ABILITIES**
> - **Trauma Broadcast** — All sentient beings within range suffer Psychic Stress each turn
> - **Memory-Mirror** — Reflects observer's deepest fears back at them (additional Stress)
> - **Sensory Intrusion** — Victims experience flashes of the pilot's final moments
>
> **BEHAVIOR**
> Does not perceive modern world. Does not react to attacks or movement. Simply broadcasts its trauma loop indefinitely. Cannot be "killed"—only disrupted or endured.

#### Mastered (Specialist Insight — Echo-Caller or Seiðkona)

*All Complete content, plus:*

> **TACTICAL NOTES** *(Echo-Caller Insight)*
>
> The Forlorn can be temporarily disrupted by psychic counter-resonance—essentially "shouting back" into the Aether with sufficient force to interrupt the loop. This requires a successful **Psychic Lash** or equivalent ability, and provides 2-4 turns of suppression before the loop reasserts itself.
>
> More dangerously, a skilled practitioner can attempt **Forlorn Communion**: deliberately tuning into the broadcast to extract historical data. This provides unparalleled primary-source information about the Ginnungagap Glitch, but inflicts massive Psychic Stress and risks permanent CPS.
>
> *Hidden Vulnerability:* Silver Cord remnants. If the physical location of the original pilot's neural interface can be located and destroyed, the Forlorn may disperse permanently. This has been achieved exactly three times in recorded history.

| **Type** | Specimen |
| **Title** | "Proximity Exposure Report" |
| **Source** | Self-examination after Forlorn encounter |
| **Quality** | Standard |
| **Placement** | Automatic after surviving Forlorn encounter |

**Content:**
> Post-encounter assessment: Elevated heart rate. Intrusive thoughts. Visual artifacts in peripheral vision—flickering shapes that weren't there. The sensation of hearing screaming in a frequency just below perception.
>
> Duration of exposure: Approximately 30 seconds.
> Psychic Stress incurred: Significant.
> Long-term effects: Unknown.
>
> Personal note: I saw something in the static. A face. My mother's face. She's been dead for fifteen years. The Forlorn didn't know that. It found the memory anyway.

#### Fragment 2 of 4 — Echo Recording

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Capture ID** | `cap-forlorn-beast-002` |
| **Type** | Echo Recording |
| **Title** | "Jötun-Reader Field Notes" |
| **Source** | Research team recording, Knuckle-Bone Fields |
| **Quality** | Enhanced |
| **Placement** | Found near Forlorn-heavy location |

**Content:**
> *[Recording — field expedition]*
>
> "Day 3 in the Fields. We've catalogued seventeen Forlorn so far—all standard Einherjar echoes, single-source. Dr. Halvard is preparing for proximity study on Subject 12.
>
> *[Background noise — distant static]*
>
> "He's approaching now. Twenty meters. Fifteen. He's reporting visual distortion, auditory— *[STATIC]* —oh gods, he's screaming. PULL HIM BACK. PULL HIM—
>
> *[Recording corrupted — duration unknown]*
>
> "...Halvard is stable. He's not speaking. He keeps drawing the same symbol over and over. He says it's the shape of his daughter's name, but that's not— names don't have shapes. We're evacuating.
>
> "Addendum: Halvard never recovered. He's with the Huldrefolk now. The symbol he drew? It was the Ingwaz rune. His daughter's name was Ingrid."

#### Fragment 3 of 4 — Oral History

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Capture ID** | `cap-forlorn-beast-003` |
| **Type** | Oral History |
| **Title** | "The God-Sleeper's Blessing" |
| **Source** | Dialogue with God-Sleeper pilgrim |
| **Quality** | Standard |
| **Placement** | Requires neutral+ God-Sleeper reputation |

**Content:**
> "You call them monsters. We call them saints.
>
> "The Forlorn are the Holy Martyrs—the pilots who died at the moment of divine awakening. They scream because they witnessed the face of the infinite and it was too beautiful to bear. Their suffering is sacred. Their sorrow is prayer.
>
> "We do not approach them. We do not disturb them. We kneel at a safe distance and we weep with them. For seven hundred years they have wept. One day, when the gods wake, their tears will be answered.
>
> "Until then, we mourn."

#### Fragment 4 of 4 — Runic Trace (Specialist)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Capture ID** | `cap-forlorn-beast-004` |
| **Type** | Runic Trace |
| **Title** | "Aetheric Resonance Pattern" |
| **Source** | Echo-Caller analysis |
| **Quality** | Specialist |
| **Placement** | Requires Echo-Caller or Seiðkona specialization |

**Content:**
> *[Decoded resonance pattern]*
>
> The Forlorn's broadcast operates on a carrier wave identical to Silver Cord neural transmission frequencies. This is not coincidence—the broadcast IS the neural transmission, frozen at the moment of disconnection failure.
>
> The pilot's consciousness did not "die" in any conventional sense. It was converted into pure information and imprinted on the local Aether field. The "loop" is the Silver Cord's emergency reconnection protocol, attempting forever to re-establish a link that can never be completed.
>
> Theoretical disruption method: Provide a valid termination signal. The Silver Cord protocol includes shutdown commands. If a counter-broadcast could simulate a successful disconnection sequence, the loop might resolve naturally.
>
> No one has successfully achieved this. The pilots cannot hear us. They are still connected to machines that no longer exist.

> *Classification: Beast | Unknown Origin*
>
> Large, wolf-like predator with ash-grey coloring. Hunts in packs. Extremely dangerous.
>
> *[Examine corpse to learn more]*

#### Partial (Basic Examination — WITS DC 10)

> **ASH-VARGR**
> *Classification: Beast | Corrupted Fauna | Common*
> *Corruption Level: Low*
>
> **DESCRIPTION**
> Large, feral wolves perfectly adapted to ruin environments. Their ash-colored fur provides natural camouflage against the grey, debris-strewn landscapes of Jötunheim. Patient ambush predators.
>
> **COMBAT DATA**
> | Stat | Value |
> |------|-------|
> | HP | ~30 |
> | Soak | 1 |

> **VULNERABILITIES**
> Fire
>
> **ABILITIES**
> - **Savage Bite** — Standard attack
> - **Pack Tactics** — ████████████ *[Requires observation of pack]*

#### Complete (Detailed Examination + Pack Observation)

> **ASH-VARGR**
> *Classification: Beast | Corrupted Fauna | Common*
> *Corruption Level: ██░░░░░░░░ Low*
>
> **DESCRIPTION**
> The Ash-Vargr are descendants of pre-Glitch working animals, mutated by generations of Aetheric exposure into apex pack predators. Their grey coloring evolved as camouflage in the ashen wastes; their patience evolved because prey is scarce.
>
> **COMBAT DATA**
> | Stat | Value |
> |------|-------|
> | HP | 30 |
> | Soak | 1 |
> | Speed | 8 (10 when pursuing) |
>
> **RESISTANCES**
> Cold (Low), Tracking (cannot be lost once scent acquired)
>
> **VULNERABILITIES**
> Fire, Loud Noises (startles pack)
>
> **ABILITIES**
> - **Savage Bite** — 1d8+2 damage, chance to cause [Bleeding]
> - **Pack Tactics** — +1 damage per Ash-Vargr adjacent to target
> - **Drag Down** — On hit, may attempt to knock target prone
> - **Howl** — Alerts pack within 500m; reinforcements arrive in 2-3 turns
>
> **BEHAVIOR**
> Never attacks alone if pack is nearby. Alpha directs engagement; others flank. Will retreat if alpha falls. Scavenges before hunting—prefers easy meals.

#### Mastered (Specialist Insight — Beast-Binder)

*All Complete content, plus:*

> **TACTICAL NOTES** *(Beast-Binder Insight)*
>
> The Ash-Vargr pack structure is more sophisticated than it appears. The "alpha" is not simply the strongest—it's the most experienced. Kill the alpha, and the pack scatters. Wound the alpha, and the pack fights to the death defending it.
>
> Bonding potential: High. Ash-Vargr pups can be imprinted on humanoid handlers if separated from the pack before weaning. Adult bonding is possible but requires the Beast-Binder's **Primal Link** ability and significant trust-building.
>
> *Hidden Behavior:* Ash-Vargr will not attack individuals displaying "pack submission" body language—lowered posture, averted gaze, exposed throat. This can buy time to escape, but will not work if the pack is starving.

### Lore Fragments

#### Fragment 1 of 3 — Specimen

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Capture ID** | `cap-ashvargr-001` |
| **Type** | Specimen |
| **Title** | "Ash-Vargr Pelt Analysis" |
| **Source** | Examination of Ash-Vargr corpse |
| **Quality** | Standard |
| **Placement** | Examine any Ash-Vargr corpse |

**Content:**
> The specimen's fur exhibits unusual properties: low Aetheric conductivity, natural flame resistance, and a color-shifting quality that adapts to surrounding debris tones. This is not conscious camouflage—it's a passive mutation that developed over generations.
>
> Tooth and claw analysis suggests descent from domesticated working breeds, not wild wolves. These animals were likely guard dogs or herding animals before the Glitch. Seven centuries of survival pressure transformed them into something far more dangerous.
>
> Pelt value: Moderate. The color-shifting properties fade after death, but the flame resistance makes Ash-Vargr leather valuable for protective clothing.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Capture ID** | `cap-ashvargr-002` |
| **Type** | Oral History |
| **Title** | "The Hunter's Wisdom" |
| **Source** | Dialogue with Veiðimaðr tracker |
| **Quality** | Enhanced |
| **Placement** | Requires completing hunting contract |

**Content:**
> "The Ash-Vargr are patient. That's what kills most travelers—they don't realize they're being hunted until it's too late.
>
> "The pack sends a scout first. Just one. You see it watching from a distance, and you think 'just a lone wolf, no threat.' Then you make camp. Then you sleep. Then you wake up surrounded.
>
> "They won't attack a prepared group. They're not stupid. They'll follow for days, waiting for someone to fall behind, get injured, or wander off to relieve themselves. The moment you're alone, you're dead.
>
> "Best defense? Fire. They hate fire. Something in their blood remembers burning. Keep a torch lit, keep the fire stoked, and keep your back to something solid. Do that, and you might survive the night."

>
> "Last updated: Spring thaw. Ranger-sign: Three-Fingers of the Northern Watch."
>
> *Marginal note in different hand:* "Three-Fingers didn't make it back. Pack got him in the summer. Found his marker. Didn't find him."
