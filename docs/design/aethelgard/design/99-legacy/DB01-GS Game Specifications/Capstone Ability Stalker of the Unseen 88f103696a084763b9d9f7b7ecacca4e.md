## Description

You have become the perfect predator of a corrupted world. Your senses have transcended the physical—you now perceive the invisible threads of the Runic Blight itself, seeing the world as streams of corrupted data. To be marked by you is to have every flaw, every vulnerability, every line of broken code laid bare. You are no longer hunting beasts—you are debugging a system.
