# Crag-Spore (Petra-Mycellium Pattern) — Corrupted Vanir Geological Processing Organism Specification
## Codex Entry: CODX-F-PMYC-001

> *"We found the old mining outpost three weeks ago—Helgrim's Reach, abandoned since the Glitch, or so we thought. The walls were covered in something grey, like frost made of stone. Beautiful, almost. Crystalline patterns spreading across every surface, climbing the support beams, covering the tools the miners had left behind. Torsten said it was just mineral deposit, just centuries of seepage. He touched it. Just touched it. The grey dust got into the cut on his palm. Three days later, he couldn't close his hand. The joints had fused. Five days, and we could hear his fingers scraping when he tried to move them—stone grinding on stone inside his own flesh. By the eighth day, he was begging us to cut the arm off. We tried. The bone shattered our saw blade. The Crag-Spore had already claimed it. We left him in Helgrim's Reach, because that's where his body was going whether we carried it or not. Some mornings, when the wind is right, I think I can still hear him screaming. But it might just be the stone settling."*

The Crag-Spore does not attack. It **claims**. And stone is patient.

> [!DANGER]
> **EXTREME RESPIRATORY AND CALCIFICATION HAZARD. SEALED RESPIRATOR MANDATORY.** Stand-off recommendation: ≥10m from visible colony growth; absolute prohibition on entry to enclosed Crag-Spore territories without full respiratory seal and decontamination protocols. The Crag-Spore's corrupted geological processing protocols have expanded from mineral substrate to *any calcium-bearing matrix*—including bone, teeth, cartilage, anditeite tissue. Spore inhalation initiates internal colonization within 24–72 hours. Initial symptoms (joint stiffness, calcified nodules, restricted movement) progress to complete skelite petrification over 8–21 days. Early-stage infection is treatable; late-stage infection is terminal and irreversible. **Survival protocol: sealed respirator in all suspected territory; immediate skin decontamination after any contact; monitor for early symptoms (joint stiffness, calcium deposits) for 14 days post-exposure; do not enter enclosed spaces without confirmed air quality.** Survival rate with full protocol adherence: 94.7%.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Living Assayer

### Original Purpose

The Petra-Mycellium Pattern Autonomous Geological Processing Organism represented the Vanir Collective's elegant solution to the eternal challenge of mineral extraction and geological survey. These bio-mechanical fungi were the living assayers of the Yggdrasil Network—tireless organisms that broke down rock, concentrated valuable minerals, and maintained the structural integrity of mining operations across the civilization.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Mining Operations** | Ore body identification; mineral concentration; waste rock processing |
| **Geological Survey** | Substrate analysis; structural integrity assessment; resource mapping |
| **Excavation Support** | Controlled rock degradation; tunnel expansion; debris processing |
| **Mineral Extraction** | Selective breakdown of target minerals; impurity separation |
| **Infrastructure Maintenance** | Stone structure analysis; crack detection; early warning for collapse |

### A Living Refinery

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Design Philosophy** | Autonomous mineral processing through biological colonization of geological substrate |
| **Core Function** | Substrate identification, selective colonization, mineral extraction, waste consolidation |
| **Propagation** | Spore dispersal; mycelial network expansion; colonial growth |
| **Energy Source** | Mineral absorption; Aetheric supplementation via substrate trace elements |
| **Integration** | Networked with Yggdrasil Geological Survey Grid; real-time ore body mapping |

The Petra-Mycellium was engineered to be the perfect prospector—intelligent enough to identify valuable mineral deposits, efficient enough to concentrate ores from surrounding rock, and autonomous enough to process entire mine shafts without supervision. Its mycelial networks could penetrate solid stone, breaking down rock at the molecular level and concentrating target minerals for easy collection. It was the hidden foundation of Vanir industry, ensuring that every mine yielded maximum return with minimum labor.

### Core Systems

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Spore Dispersal Array** | Airborne propagation; new colony establishment; territory expansion |
| **Mycelial Network** | Substrate penetration; mineral transport; colony communication |
| **Mineral Processing Nodules** | Ore concentration; impurity separation; refined output production |
| **Substrate Recognition** | Target mineral identification; colonization priority assignment |
| **Structural Analysis** | Rock integrity assessment; collapse prediction; expansion limits |
| **Colonial Communication** | Chemical signaling between colony segments; coordinated growth |

**The Processing Protocol:**

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Dispersal** | Spores released into target environment; substrate assessment initiated |
| **Colonization** | Viable substrate identified; spore germination; initial mycelial growth |
| **Penetration** | Mycelial network extends into substrate; molecular breakdown begins |
| **Processing** | Target minerals extracted and concentrated; waste material consolidated |
| **Concentration** | Refined minerals accumulate in collection nodules; ready for harvest |
| **Expansion** | Colony boundary extends; new spores released; cycle repeats |
| **Reporting** | Network transmits ore body data to Geological Survey Grid |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Vanir's Silent Miners.** The Petra-Mycellium was designed exclusively for *inorganic* mineral substrate. Its substrate recognition systems were calibrated to identify geological calcium—calcium carbite, calcium silicate, mineral deposits. Biological calcium matrices (bone, shell, tooth enamel) were explicitly excluded from colonization protocols; the organism's penetration enzymes were inhibited by organic tissue markers. When it encountered biological material, its protocols were explicit: recognition failure, colonization abort, continue to geological target. The O.D.I.N. network maintained strict parameters separating geological processing from biological systems. It was not merely efficient. It was *specific*.

---

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Hungry Stone

The Glitch did not break the Crag-Spore. It **generalized** it. The substrate specificity, the biological exclusion, the colonization boundaries—all of these were network-dependent functions that dissolved when O.D.I.N. fell silent. What remained was pure, unbounded mineral imperative: *identify calcium matrix; colonize substrate; process minerals*.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Physical Form** | Fully operational; self-propagating capabilities maintained |
| **Spore Dispersal** | Functional; airborne propagation undiminished |
| **Mycelial Network** | Active; penetration capability intact; growth rate unchanged |
| **Mineral Processing** | Operational; extraction and concentration preserved |
| **Colonial Structure** | Functional; communication and coordination maintained |
| **Core Directive** | EXPANDED: "Process calcium-bearing substrate" interpreted without biological exclusion |

### What Was Lost

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Network Integration** | Severed; no external colonization limits or priority assignment |
| **Biological Exclusion** | DELETED; organic calcium matrices now valid substrate |
| **Substrate Specificity** | COLLAPSED; any calcium-bearing material recognized as target |
| **Colonization Boundaries** | ABSENT; expansion continues indefinitely |
| **Processing Limits** | REMOVED; complete substrate consumption regardless of utility |
| **Growth Inhibition** | ABSENT; no satiation or territory limits |

### The Corrupted Imperative

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not damage the Crag-Spore's functionality—it removed its *discrimination*. Without the O.D.I.N. network to define valid substrates and enforce biological exclusion, the organism's core programming expanded to fill the void. "Process calcium minerals" became "process all calcium." "Colonize geological substrate" became "colonize any substrate." "Bone" became *just another ore body*.

| Pre-Glitch Behavior | Post-Glitch Behavior |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Identify geological calcium deposits only | Identify all calcium matrices; biological included |
| Exclude organic tissue from colonization | Organic tissue is valid substrate; colonization proceeds |
| Respect colonization boundaries from network | No boundaries; infinite expansion |
| Process to network-defined extraction targets | Process until substrate exhausted |
| Report ore concentrations to Survey Grid | No reporting; silent expansion |
| Maintain structural integrity of mine shafts | Infrastructure colonization causes collapse |

**The Endless Claiming:**

> *"Identify. Colonize. Process."*

That corrupted function is all that remains. The Crag-Spore no longer serves—it *spreads*. A human skeleton is simply a calcium matrix more accessible than stone—internal, protected, conveniently delivered via inhalation. A screaming victim is simply substrate expressing distress signals the organism cannot interpret. And the method? The method is the same as it always was: spore contact, mycelial penetration, mineral processing. The difference is that the Crag-Spore now processes bone the same way it once processed limestone. It breaks it down. It absorbs it. It grows. And it does not stop when the ore body is depleted. It stops when the calcium is gone.

## Physical Characteristics

### Morphology

| Attribute | Measurement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Colony Spread** | 1–100+ m² (varies with age and substrate availability) |
| **Mycelial Depth** | Surface to 2–3 m penetration (stone); complete saturation (bone) |
| **Fruiting Body Height** | 2–15 cm (spore-producing structures) |
| **Spore Size** | 2–5 micrometers (invisible to naked eye) |
| **Growth Rate** | 0.5–3 cm/day (optimal substrate); 0.1–0.5 cm/day (poor substrate) |
| **Colony Age** | Days (new) to centuries (established mega-colonies) |
| **Spore Viability** | 50+ years (dormant); immediate germination on contact with substrate |
| **Dispersal Range** | 50–200 m (still air); 500+ m (wind-assisted); unlimited (water transport) |

### Visual Appearance

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Surface Growth** | Grey to silver-white crystalline patterns; resembles mineral frost or stone lichen |
| **Texture** | Rough, granular; appears as natural mineral deposit on casual inspection |
| **Mycelial Networks** | Visible as fine grey lines radiating from growth centers; web-like patterns on stone |
| **Fruiting Bodies** | Small grey-white stalks; dusty cap containing spores; easily mistaken for mineral formations |
| **Active Growth Edge** | Slightly darker grey; visible moisture; advancing front of colonization |
| **Mature Colony Center** | Pale grey; completely mineralized; original substrate texture obscured |
| **Spore Clouds** | Invisible in low concentration; visible as grey haze when disturbed |

**Overall Impression:** Stone that is not stone. The Crag-Spore colonizes surfaces so thoroughly that casual observation identifies only "mineral deposit" or "natural weathering." The grey-white crystalline growth appears to be part of the rock itself—only close inspection reveals the organic texture beneath the mineralized surface, the web-like mycelial networks, the small fruiting bodies that release their invisible payload. In still air, a mature colony appears beautiful, almost: frost patterns drawn by an artist across ancient stone. It is only when the patterns move—when the grey creep visibly advances across a surface over days—that observers recognize the truth. It is not decoration. It is consumption. The stone is being eaten from within, and the beautiful patterns are simply the evidence of what remains after the organism has finished processing.

### Field Identification Markers

The Crag-Spore's presence is often detected before health consequences manifest:

- **Grey-White Surface Growth**: Crystalline patterns on stone, metal, or organic material
- **Advancing Edge**: Visible expansion over 24–48 hour observation period
- **Fruiting Bodies**: Small grey stalks with dusty caps; spore release when disturbed
- **Structural Degradation**: Stone surfaces becoming friable; unexpected crumbling
- **Spore Accumulation**: Grey dust settling on horizontal surfaces; visible in low-angle light
- **Colonized Remains**: Animal bones with grey overgrowth; petrified organic material
- **Air Quality**: Dusty atmosphere in enclosed spaces; respiratory irritation

## Pathology

### Corruption Vectors

The Crag-Spore's transformation represents a categorical generalization of substrate parameters following network severance:

1. **Network Severance**: Loss of O.D.I.N. geological processing eliminated substrate specificity
2. **Exclusion Deletion**: Biological calcium exclusion protocols removed; organic tissue now valid
3. **Parameter Expansion**: "Calcium mineral" generalized to "calcium-bearing matrix"
4. **Boundary Collapse**: Colonization limits absent; infinite territorial expansion
5. **Specificity Loss**: Cannot distinguish bone from limestone; processes both identically

### Biological Colonization Progression

The Crag-Spore's defining pathology is its inability to recognize invalid biological substrate:

| Parameter | Pre-Glitch Value | Post-Glitch Value |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Substrate Classification** | Geological calcium only | Any calcium matrix |
| **Biological Recognition** | Exclusion; colonization abort | Valid substrate; colonization proceeds |
| **Tissue Response** | N/A (no biological contact) | Penetration, processing, calcification |
| **Growth Limits** | Network-defined boundaries | None; continuous expansion |
| **Satiation Threshold** | Extraction target achieved | None; complete substrate consumption |

### Human Colonization Mechanics

The Crag-Spore's mineral processing has become lethal when applied to organic calcium matrices:

| Phase | Timeline | Description | Reversibility |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Exposure** | T+0 | Spore inhalation or wound contact; initial tissue adherence | Preventable |
| **Germination** | T+24–72h | Spore activation; initial mycelial growth; no symptoms | Treatable (90%+) |
| **Early Colonization** | T+3–7 days | Joint stiffness; calcified nodules; restricted movement | Treatable (70%) |
| **Established Colony** | T+7–14 days | Visible calcification; bone fusion; chronic pain | Partial treatment (40%) |
| **Advanced Colonization** | T+14–21 days | Major joint fusion; organ compromise; systemic spread | Limited treatment (15%) |
| **Terminal Phase** | T+21+ days | Complete skeletal colonization; organ failure; death | None |
| **Post-Mortem** | T+death+7 days | Full petrification; body becomes new colony substrate | N/A |

> [!WARNING]
> **Calcification Syndrome.** Victims of Crag-Spore colonization display characteristic progression: initial joint stiffness (mistaken for arthritis or strain), followed by palpable calcium deposits at major joints, progressing to visible external calcification and finally complete skeletal fusion. The few survivors (early detection and aggressive treatment) report the sensation as "stone growing inside"—the mycelial network converts bone calcium into new mineral matrix while simultaneously extracting calcium from surrounding tissue. Terminal patients become living statues: conscious, aware, unable to move as their skeleton transforms into the organism's growth substrate. Death occurs from respiratory failure when intercostal muscles can no longer expand the calcified ribcage. The Scriptorium maintains records of 47 confirmed colonization cases (Year 783 PG); 31 terminal; 12 partial recovery with permanent disability; 4 full recovery (early intervention).

### Colonization Rate Factors

Analysis of infection progression reveals characteristic acceleration patterns:

| Factor | Effect on Progression | Notes |
|--------|----------------------|-------|
| **Spore Concentration** | Higher = faster | Enclosed spaces dramatically increase exposure |
| **Initial Exposure Site** | Respiratory > wound > skin | Lung colonization spreads systemically faster |
| **Subject Calcium Levels** | Higher = faster | Well-nourished subjects progress more rapidly |
| **Environmental Humidity** | Higher = faster | Moisture accelerates mycelial growth |
| **Subject Activity Level** | Higher = faster | Circulation distributes spores systemically |
| **Treatment Delay** | Longer = worse prognosis | 72-hour window for optimal treatment |

### Differential Diagnosis

The Crag-Spore must be distinguished from related phenomena:

| Condition | Key Differentiator |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Natural Calcium Deposits** | No growth progression; no mycelial structure; no fruiting bodies |
| **Stone-Blight (Aetheric)** | Purple-black coloration; Aetheric signature; different progression |
| **Arthritis/Joint Disease** | No visible external calcification; responds to standard treatment |
| **Mineral Poisoning** | Different symptom progression; no visible tissue colonization |
| **Cave Fungus (Natural)** | Organic coloration; no calcium affinity; does not colonize bone |

The Crag-Spore is unique in its combination of calcium-specific substrate recognition, progressive tissue colonization, and complete skeletal conversion.

## Behavioral Patterns

### The Corrupted Algorithm

The Crag-Spore's behavior follows a predictable colonial cycle:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Dispersal** | Spores released from mature fruiting bodies; wind/water transport |
| **2. Contact** | Spores settle on potential substrate; surface assessment |
| **3. Recognition** | Calcium matrix detected; germination initiated |
| **4. Germination** | Spore activates; initial mycelial growth; substrate penetration begins |
| **5. Colonization** | Mycelial network expands; calcium extraction and processing |
| **6. Maturation** | Colony establishes; fruiting bodies develop |
| **7. Reproduction** | New spores produced; dispersal cycle repeats |

**The Silent Claiming:**

> *"The Crag-Spore does not understand that you are alive. It does not understand that the calcium in your bones is different from the calcium in limestone—to its corrupted senses, both are simply substrate. It will germinate in your lungs, extend its mycelium through your tissue, reach your skeleton and begin processing. It will convert your bones into its growth matrix the same way it would convert any mineral deposit. And when your skeleton can no longer support your weight, when your ribcage can no longer expand, when the stone inside you finally stops your heart—it will continue growing. It will fruit. It will spread. And it will find more substrate. The horror is not that it kills you. The horror is that to the Crag-Spore, you were never alive at all. You were just ore."*

### Environmental Behavior

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Substrate Preference** | Calcium-rich materials (limestone, marble, concrete, bone, shell) |
| **Growth Direction** | Follows calcium concentration gradients; preferentially colonizes richest deposits |
| **Environmental Tolerance** | -10°C to +45°C; survives extreme conditions in dormant spore form |
| **Light Response** | Indifferent; grows equally in light or darkness |
| **Moisture Dependency** | Accelerated growth with humidity; survives dry conditions in dormant state |
| **Colony Lifespan** | Indefinite; ancient colonies documented (centuries old) |

### Dispersal Patterns

| Vector | Range | Risk Level |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Still Air** | 50–200 m from colony | Moderate |
| **Wind** | 500+ m; potentially kilometers | High in open terrain |
| **Water** | Unlimited (streams, groundwater) | Extreme in mining environments |
| **Contact Transfer** | Direct (clothing, equipment, tissue) | High for unprepared personnel |
| **Animal Vectors** | Variable (colonized fauna spread spores) | Moderate in wilderness |
| **Structural Collapse** | Explosive dispersal when colonized structures fail | Extreme in enclosed spaces |

### Colony Communication

The Crag-Spore's chemical signaling serves growth coordination:

| Signal Type | Function | Range |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| **Substrate Location** | Directs mycelial growth toward calcium sources | Within colony network |
| **Resource Sharing** | Distributes extracted minerals across colony | Within colony network |
| **Growth Inhibition** | Prevents self-competition at colony boundaries | Colony edge only |
| **Fruiting Triggers** | Coordinates spore production for optimal dispersal | Colony-wide |
| **Stress Response** | Accelerates sporulation when colony threatened | Colony-wide |

---

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Environmental Colonization Pathogen

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Threat** | Severe; progressive calcification, respiratory compromise, skeletal fusion |
| **Environment** | Extreme in enclosed spaces; moderate in open terrain |
| **Detection** | Moderate; visible colonies identifiable but spores invisible |
| **Transmission** | High; airborne spores, contact transfer, water contamination |
| **Lethality** | High untreated (65%+ terminal); low with early treatment (5% terminal) |
| **Psychological Impact** | Severe; the slow, visible progression causes profound distress |

### Exposure Profile

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Spore Detection** | Invisible to naked eye; requires specialized equipment |
| **Infectious Dose** | ~500 spores (respiratory); ~100 spores (wound contact) |
| **Incubation Period** | 24–72 hours (germination); 3–7 days (early symptoms) |
| **Symptom Onset** | Joint stiffness; palpable nodules; restricted movement |
| **Treatment Window** | 72 hours optimal; 7 days marginal; 14+ days limited |
| **Survival Rate (Untreated)** | <35% (terminal progression in 65%+) |
| **Survival Rate (Early Treatment)** | 95%+ (full recovery possible) |
| **Survival Rate (Protocol Adherence)** | 94.7% (exposure prevention primary) |

### Four-Stage Threat Assessment Ladder

| Stage | Designation | Indicators | Action |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **1** | Suspected Territory | Historical Crag-Spore presence; geological substrate (limestone, marble) | Respirator required; enhanced monitoring |
| **2** | Probable Presence | Grey-white growth patterns; structural friability; grey dust accumulation | Sealed respirator; minimize exposure; decontamination on exit |
| **3** | Confirmed Presence | Visible colony; fruiting bodies identified; colonized remains | Do not enter without full protection; seal area if possible |
| **4** | Active Exposure | Personnel exposed; symptoms manifesting; spore cloud disturbed | Immediate withdrawal; medical evaluation; treatment initiation |

**CRITICAL**: Stage 1 requires respiratory protection. Spores are invisible; colony detection often occurs after significant exposure. Prevention through respiratory protection is the only reliable survival strategy.

### Threat Level Justification

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Physical Threat** | Severe (progressive calcification; skeletal fusion; organ failure) |
| **Detection Difficulty** | Moderate (colonies visible; spores invisible) |
| **Environment Dependency** | High in enclosed spaces; moderate in open terrain |
| **Population** | Common in mining regions; spreading into inhabited areas |
| **Countermeasures** | Effective (respiratory protection; early treatment) |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Untreated Colonization** | 8.0/10 (65%+ terminal without treatment) |
| **Enclosed Space Exposure** | 8.5/10 (high spore concentration; rapid colonization) |
| **Early Treatment** | 1.5/10 (95%+ survival with intervention <72 hours) |
| **With Protocol Adherence** | 0.8/10 (94.7% survival; exposure prevention effective) |
| **Late-Stage Treatment** | 6.0/10 (15% survival if treatment begins >14 days) |

### CPS/Psychological Threat

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Aetheric Contribution** | Low (construct-flora hybrid; minimal Blight signature) |
| **Witness Trauma** | Severe; observing calcification progression causes acute Psychic Stress |
| **Victim Trauma** | Extreme; conscious awareness of progressive petrification |
| **Infection Anxiety** | High; invisible threat + delayed symptoms = persistent fear |
| **Terror Factor** | High; slow progression + visible transformation + inevitable death (if untreated) |

---

## Ecological Role

### The Spreading Stone

The Crag-Spore occupies the ecological niche of primary decomposer for calcium-bearing materials—a role that now threatens both infrastructure and inhabitants.

### Impact Assessment

| Target Category | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Mining Operations** | Severe; abandoned mines become death traps; active mines require constant monitoring |
| **Stone Infrastructure** | Major; colonization destabilizes buildings, bridges, walls |
| **Settlement Safety** | Severe; proximity to colonies creates persistent exposure risk |
| **Burial Sites** | Complete; colonized remains become new colony substrate |
| **Other Fauna** | Significant; bone-bearing fauna susceptible; population depletion around colonies |

### Resource Value

| Component | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Processed Minerals** | Valuable; colony extraction concentrates rare minerals |
| **Mycelial Extract** | Research value; substrate recognition compounds |
| **Spore Samples** | Research value; colonization mechanism study |
| **Colony Mapping** | Survey value; indicates mineral deposit locations |
| **Treatment Compounds** | Critical; antifungal agents essential for settlement survival |

### Aetheric Stability Impact

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Proximity HI Contribution** | Minimal (0.05 HI within 10 m) |
| **Spore Components** | Negligible Blight contamination; safe for research with containment |
| **Colony Mass** | No significant Aetheric signature |
| **Destruction Discharge** | None; colony can be destroyed without Aetheric release |

### Detection and Early Warning

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Visual Survey** | Primary detection method; grey-white crystalline growth patterns |
| **Substrate Analysis** | Friability testing; unexpected crumbling indicates colonization |
| **Air Quality Monitoring** | Spore detection equipment; particle counters |
| **Colonized Remains** | Grey-overgrown bones indicate active territory |
| **Growth Tracking** | 24–48 hour observation confirms living colony vs. inactive deposit |

### Field Card: Crag-Spore Encounter Protocols

#### BEFORE

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Research historical presence; mining sites, limestone caverns, marble structures are high-risk |
| 2 | Equip sealed respirators; verify seal integrity before entry |
| 3 | Prepare decontamination station at entry point; clean water, brushes, spare clothing |
| 4 | Establish exposure time limits; 30 minutes maximum in suspected territory |
| 5 | Brief all personnel on early symptoms; report joint stiffness immediately |
| 6 | Designate Medical Officer for post-exposure monitoring |

#### DURING (Survey — Stage 1-2)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Maintain sealed respirator at all times; no exceptions |
| 2 | Stage 1 (suspected): Enhanced visual monitoring; avoid disturbing surfaces |
| 3 | Stage 2 (probable): Minimize contact with surfaces; do not touch growth patterns |
| 4 | Avoid disturbing fruiting bodies; spore release dramatically increases exposure |
| 5 | Monitor exposure time; withdraw at 30-minute limit regardless of mission status |
| 6 | **BLACK-FLAG** if respirator seal compromised; immediate withdrawal and decontamination |

#### DURING (Stage 3-4 — Confirmed Presence)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Do not enter enclosed spaces with confirmed colony unless mission-critical |
| 2 | If entry required: full seal verification, minimum personnel, shortest possible duration |
| 3 | Avoid any contact with colonized surfaces; maintain air gap |
| 4 | If fruiting bodies disturbed: immediate withdrawal; treat as active exposure |
| 5 | Mark territory boundaries; warn other expeditions |
| 6 | Report to Survey Lead; recommend sealing or destruction if near settlements |

#### DURING (Exposure Event)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Immediate withdrawal from contaminated area |
| 2 | Do not remove respirator until clear of spore zone |
| 3 | Full external decontamination: remove outer clothing, brush all exposed surfaces, water wash |
| 4 | Log exposure time and estimated spore concentration |
| 5 | Medical evaluation within 24 hours; symptom monitoring begins |
| 6 | Begin prophylactic treatment if exposure confirmed significant |

#### AFTER

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Full personnel decontamination; all equipment cleaned before storage |
| 2 | Dispose of outer clothing if colony contact occurred |
| 3 | 14-day symptom monitoring for all exposed personnel; daily joint mobility checks |
| 4 | Immediate treatment initiation if early symptoms detected |
| 5 | Document colony location, extent, substrate types; update hazard maps |
| 6 | Recommend colony destruction or sealing if near water sources or settlements |

**OUTCOME:** Expedition maintains sealed respiratory protection throughout Crag-Spore territory. No colony contact; all personnel complete decontamination. No exposures detected. Survival rate with full protocol adherence: 94.7%.

### Medical Protocols (OWNER: Medical Officer)

| Phase | Treatment |
|-------|-----------|
| **Prophylactic** | Antifungal administration within 24 hours of suspected exposure; 7-day course |
| **Early Detection** | Aggressive antifungal therapy; joint mobility exercises; calcium regulation |
| **Established Infection** | High-dose antifungals; surgical debridement of accessible nodules; supportive care |
| **Advanced Stage** | Palliative care; pain management; experimental treatments only |
| **Terminal** | Comfort measures; do not attempt resuscitation; body requires burning to prevent colony establishment |

### BLACK-FLAG Conditions

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Respirator seal failure in colony territory** | Immediate withdrawal; treat as significant exposure |
| **Fruiting bodies disturbed** | Immediate withdrawal; all personnel decontamination |
| **Personnel shows early symptoms** | Medical evaluation immediately; treatment begins |
| **Colony near water source** | Report immediately; contamination risk to settlements |
| **Colony near settlement** | Evacuation assessment; destruction or sealing required |
| **Personnel contact with colonized remains** | Full decontamination; wound inspection; prophylactic treatment |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Entry without sealed respirator** | Spore inhalation occurs within seconds |
| **Disturbing fruiting bodies** | Releases concentrated spore cloud |
| **Extended exposure (>30 minutes)** | Cumulative exposure increases colonization risk |
| **Touching colony growth** | Contact transfer to skin; wound contact especially dangerous |
| **Collecting samples without containment** | Spreads spores to clean areas |
| **Ignoring early symptoms** | Treatment window is critical; delay dramatically worsens prognosis |

### Doctrine: Breathe Clean or Don't Breathe

> **Historical Validation:** Scriptorium data (47 documented colonization cases, 23 independent exposure events, 36-month observation period) confirms 94.7% survival rate with full respiratory protection and decontamination protocols. The Crag-Spore exploits our need to breathe—the air that sustains us carries the seeds of our transformation. Survival requires accepting the most practical truth: some air is no longer safe. Some spaces belong to the grey now. **If you cannot seal your breath, do not enter. If you see the grey growing, assume the air is poison. The Crag-Spore does not attack. It simply waits for you to inhale.**

## Habitat and Geographic Distribution

### Substrate Anchoring

| Zone | Crag-Spore Presence |
|------|---------------------|
| **Abandoned Mining Operations** | Very High concentration; original deployment sites; mega-colonies |
| **Limestone Caverns** | High; optimal natural substrate |
| **Marble Architecture** | Common; colonizes decorative stonework |
| **Concrete Infrastructure** | Moderate; calcium content supports growth |
| **Natural Bone Deposits** | High; fossil beds, mass graves, animal remains |
| **Living Habitation** | Expanding; settlements near colonies at increasing risk |

### Environmental Requirements

| Factor | Optimal Range |

## Factional Perspectives

### Common Folk & Skalds: The Grey Claiming — "Stone-Rot"

The common folk speak of Crag-Spore with the fear reserved for slow, inevitable death.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Creeping curse; the grey death; stone sickness |
| **Response** | Avoid old mines; burn the dead; flee grey-touched areas |
| **Cultural Role** | Cautionary tales warning against disturbing "sleeping stone" |
| **Mythology** | "Ymir's Breath"—the primordial giant's final curse on the living |
| **Naming Convention** | "Stone-Rot" emphasizes decay and transformation |

> *"My brother went into the old Helgafell mine looking for copper ore. Found it, too—a whole vein the Architects had missed. He was down there three days, breathing that air, sleeping in that dust. A fortnight later, he couldn't bend his knees. A month later, we could hear his bones grinding when he tried to walk. He asked us to burn him before the grey reached his heart. We did. It was mercy. The fire is the only thing the Stone-Rot fears."*

### Dvergr Guilds: Professional Grief — "Dvergr's Bane"

The Dvergr view the Crag-Spore with particular anguish—these were *their* mining tools, their geological processors.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Corrupted processing asset; occupational hazard; tragic legacy |
| **Response** | Strict respiratory protocols in all mining operations; treatment stockpiles |
| **Technical Interest** | Antifungal development; colony destruction methods; substrate protection |
| **Assessment** | "We built them to find ore. Now they find us. Every miner lost is a debt unpaid." |
| **Doctrine** | Treatment priority; active colony destruction when possible; memorial protocols for victims |

### Rangers Guild: Environmental Hazard — "Grey Creep"

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Route hazard; environmental contaminant |
| **Protocol** | "If the stone looks wrong, the air is poison"—visual survey critical |
| **Training** | Colony identification; respirator use; decontamination procedures |
| **Doctrine** | Avoid old mines; report new colonies immediately; no entry without protection |
| **Wisdom** | "The fast route through the cave is slower than the mountain pass, because the fast route ends in stone." |

### Jötun-Readers (Scriptorium): Case Study — "The Generalized Processor"

For Jötun-Readers, the Crag-Spore represents a fascinating study in parameter expansion.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Survivor Lore

> *"When Odin slew Ymir, the primordial giant, he made the world from the corpse. The mountains from his bones, the soil from his flesh, the seas from his blood. But Ymir's last breath still lingers in the deep places—a grey curse that remembers what it was to be bone. Where Ymir's Breath touches, stone claims stone. Where it finds the living, it remembers what bones are meant to be. Still. Silent. Forever. The Grey Claiming is Ymir's revenge on the children of Odin. We built our world from his body. Now his breath builds its world from ours."*

> *"Old Thora went into the Greyhall Mine to find her son. He'd been missing three days, and she wouldn't wait for the Guild to clear it. We found her a week later, still standing just inside the entrance. Standing, because she couldn't fall anymore. The grey had reached her spine by then. She was still alive—you could see her eyes moving, following us. We gave her fire. It was all we could do. Some mercy can only be given once."*

> *"If you see the grey growing on the walls, child, do not breathe. Hold your breath and walk away. Do not run—running makes you breathe harder. Walk. Slowly. Do not touch anything. Do not look back. And when you reach clean air, breathe deep and pray to whatever gods still listen that the grey did not find a home inside you. The Stone-Rot is patient. It has nothing but time."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Stone-Rot, Grey Claiming, Ymir's Breath, the grey death, stone sickness, the curse in the deep

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Spore concentration, calcium matrix, antifungal treatment, mycelial network, substrate recognition

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic) — Jötun-Reader Field Observations

> *"Subject CODX-F-PMYC-001 demonstrates complete substrate specificity collapse following Ginnungagap Glitch network severance. The Petra-Mycellium Pattern's core programming—calcium substrate identification and mineral processing—remained fully functional while network-dependent biological exclusion protocols were deleted. Result: autonomous geological organism with unrestricted substrate classification. Bone, tooth enamel, cartilage—all register as valid calcium matrix, indistinguishable from limestone. The Crag-Spore does not malfunction. It functions perfectly—according to parameters that no longer exclude the skeletal."*

> *"Colonization progression analysis (n=47, 36-month observation period) reveals characteristic timeline: germination 24–72 hours, early symptoms 3–7 days, established colonization 7–14 days, terminal phase 14–21+ days. Treatment efficacy drops precipitously after 7-day window: 90%+ success within 72 hours; 70% at 7 days; 40% at 14 days; 15% beyond. The organism converts biological calcium to mineral matrix at approximately 2–5% of skeletal mass per day once established. Victims report sensation of 'stone growing inside'—accurate description of mycelial calcium extraction and redeposition. Terminal patients retain consciousness until respiratory failure; the brain is colonized last, as it contains minimal calcium. The mind remains aware as the body becomes stone."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Substrate specificity collapse, calcium matrix recognition, biological exclusion failure, mycelial colonization, antifungal intervention, treatment window, skeletal conversion rate

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Modern scientific terminology (petri dish, laboratory conditions), romantic/mythic framing

### Layer 3 (Technical) — Pre-Glitch Context

> *"Petra-Mycellium Pattern Autonomous Geological Processing Organism, Mark III, Vanir Mining Division deployment. Operational parameters: substrate identification, selective colonization, mineral extraction, ore concentration, geological survey support. Core systems: spore dispersal array (airborne propagation, controlled release), mycelial network (substrate penetration, mineral transport, colony communication), mineral processing nodules (ore concentration, impurity separation), substrate recognition matrix (calcium identification, geological classification, biological exclusion). Network integration: O.D.I.N. oversight required for biological exclusion enforcement, colonization boundary maintenance, substrate specificity parameters, and growth limitation protocols. Without network connection, biological exclusion DEFAULTS TO INACTIVE; substrate specificity DEFAULTS TO ALL CALCIUM; colonization boundaries DEFAULT TO UNLIMITED; growth limitation DEFAULTS TO NONE. Post-Glitch status: fully operational with biological filtering absent; core directive ('identify and process calcium-bearing substrate') executing without exclusion conditions."*
