## I. Purpose

v0.38.7 creates **Ability & Galdr Flavor Text**, bringing magical abilities to life:

- **50+ Galdr Casting Descriptors** (per rune school)
- **30+ Ability Outcome Descriptors** (success levels, manifestations)
- **20+ Miscast/Paradox Descriptors** (Runic Blight interference)
- **Contextual Layering** (biome, power level, caster skill)

**Strategic Function:**

Currently, ability text is mechanical:

- ❌ "You cast Flame Bolt. Deal 8 Fire damage."
- ❌ No reflection of Norse magical tradition (Galdr = sung runes)
- ❌ No Blight corruption in failed casts

**v0.38.7 Solution:**

- Sung/chanted Galdr descriptions
- Rune school-specific manifestations
- Success spectrum (minor → devastating)
- Blight paradox on miscasts
- Alfheim reality distortion

---

## II. Norse Magic Context

### Galdr Tradition

**From Setting:**

- Galdr = "sung magic," runic incantations
- Practitioners called Seiðkona (women) / Seiðmaðr (men)
- 24 runes of the Elder Futhark divided into 3 Ættir (families)
- Each rune has phonetic sound + conceptual meaning

### Rune Schools (From v0.23)

**Fehu's Ætt (Material World):**

- Fehu (Wealth, Cattle) → Fire magic
- Þurisaz (Giant, Thorn) → Ice/Cold
- Ansuz (God, Breath) → Wind/Lightning
- Rāidō (Journey, Wheel) → Movement/Speed

**Hagalaz's Ætt (Chaos & Transformation):**

- Hagalaz (Hail) → Destructive ice
- Nāuþz (Need) → Draining/Weakening
- Īsaz (Ice) → Stasis/Freezing
- Jēra (Year, Harvest) → Time/Growth

**Tīwaz's Ætt (Divine Order):**

- Tīwaz (Tyr, Justice) → Protective wards
- Berkanan (Birch, Growth) → Healing
- Mannaz (Human) → Enhancement
- Laguz (Water, Lake) → Purification

## III. Galdr Casting Descriptors

### General Casting Framework

**Chanting Pattern:**

1. **Invocation:** "You begin to chant..."
2. **Rune Manifestation:** The rune appears/forms
3. **Effect Discharge:** Magic resolves
4. **Aftermath:** Environmental/personal reaction

---

### School 1: Fehu (Fire)

### Ability: Flame Bolt

**Minor Success (1-2 successes):**

- "You chant the Fehu rune, its fiery syllables harsh on your tongue. Flames sputter weakly from your palm, barely reaching the {Target}."
- "You intone Fehu's name—a small gout of fire leaps forth, more smoke than flame."

**Solid Success (3-4 successes):**

- "You sing the Fehu rune, its ancient power igniting the air. A bolt of flame streaks toward the {Target}, trailing embers."
- "'Fehu! Fehu! Fehu!' The chant builds—fire erupts from your outstretched hand in a roaring lance!"

**Exceptional Success (5+ successes):**

- "You invoke Fehu with perfect resonance—the rune blazes in the air before you! A devastating torrent of flame engulfs the {Target}!"
- "Your Galdr reaches a crescendo. Fehu manifests as a burning sigil, and reality itself ignites! The {Target} is consumed by primal fire!"

**Miscast (Paradox):**

- "Your chant falters—the Blight warps Fehu's meaning! Fire burns backward, cold as ice, wrong!"
- "The rune you summon isn't Fehu—it's something else, something that shouldn't exist. Paradoxical flame erupts unpredictably!"

### Ability: Inferno Ward

**Casting:**

- "You trace Fehu in the air, chanting its protective aspects. Fire coalesces into a whirling barrier around you."
- "Your Galdr weaves Fehu into a shield—flames dance across your skin without burning."

**Active Effect:**

- "The Inferno Ward flares as the {Enemy} strikes, flames licking outward to punish the assault!"
- "Your fiery barrier pulses with each attack, the {Enemy} recoiling from the heat!"

---

### School 2: Þurisaz (Ice/Thorns)

### Ability: Frost Lance

**Solid Success:**

- "You chant Þurisaz, the giant's rune. Ice crystallizes from nothing, forming a deadly spear that hurtles toward the {Target}!"
- "Your Galdr echoes with Þurisaz's harsh consonants—frost erupts, flash-freezing the very air into a piercing lance!"

**Exceptional Success:**

- "You sing Þurisaz with terrible clarity. The rune appears as frozen fire—the lance that forms is less ice than winter's wrath made solid!"

**Miscast:**

- "The Blight corrupts your chant! Þurisaz inverts—the frost burns, thorns grow from ice, nothing makes sense!"

---

### School 3: Ansuz (Wind/Lightning)

### Ability: Lightning Bolt

**Solid Success:**

- "You invoke Ansuz, the breath of gods. Lightning arcs from your fingertips with a thunderous crack!"
- "Your Galdr calls upon Ansuz—electricity crackles through the air, coalescing into a bolt that strikes the {Target}!"

**Exceptional Success:**

- "You shout Ansuz with divine authority! The rune blazes white-hot—lightning chains between targets, reality itself shocked by the power!"

---

### School 4: Berkanan (Healing)

### Ability: Healing Chant

**Solid Success:**

- "You sing Berkanan's gentle syllables, the growth-rune. Warmth flows through you as flesh begins to knit."
- "Your Galdr resonates with Berkanan's nurturing power. Green light bathes your wounds—skin closes, bones realign."

**Exceptional Success:**

- "You invoke Berkanan with perfect pitch. The rune manifests as a flowering tree—life itself pours into you, mending even grievous injuries!"

**Alfheim Corruption:**

- "You chant Berkanan, but the Blight interferes! The healing is... wrong. Flesh grows too fast, in the wrong places. You're healed, but at what cost?"

---

## IV. Biome-Specific Manifestations

### The Roots

**Fire Magic:**

- "Steam erupts from rusty pipes as your Galdr ignites the humid air."
- "Your flames reflect in pools of stagnant water, casting eerie shadows."

**Ice Magic:**

- "Frost spreads across corroded metal, cracking with satisfying pops."
- "Your ice magic crystallizes the humid air, creating beautiful but deadly formations."

### Muspelheim

**Fire Magic:**

- "Your flames seem pitiful compared to the ambient inferno, but they obey your will."
- "Fire answers fire—your Galdr draws upon the volcanic fury all around!"

**Ice Magic:**

- "The Inferno fights your ice! Steam explodes as cold meets heat!"
- "Against all logic, frost manifests in this hellish place—a testament to your power!"

### Alfheim

**All Magic:**

- "The Cursed Choir harmonizes with your Galdr—or does it corrupt it?"
- "Your rune flickers between states—was that Fehu or is it Fehu or will it be Fehu?"
- "Reality itself rebels against your magic—yet the spell works anyway!"
