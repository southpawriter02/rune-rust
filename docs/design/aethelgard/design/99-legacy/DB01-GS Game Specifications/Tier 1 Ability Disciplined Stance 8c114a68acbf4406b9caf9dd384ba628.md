## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Disciplined Stance is the Atgeir-wielder's **foundational defensive stance**—the moment they plant their feet, set the butt of their polearm against the ground, and become an **immovable anchor**. This establishes their role as the stable center of any formation.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Grant +4 Soak for 2 rounds
- **Secondary:** Grant +3 dice to resist [Push] and [Pull] effects
- **Trade-off:** Cannot move while stance is active
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The unyielding bastion of defensive discipline

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High (significant defensive boost)
- **Immobility Trade-off:** Cannot reposition during stance
- **Polearm Requirement:** Must have [Polearm] weapon equipped
- **Stance Conflict:** Overwrites other active stances

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The warrior **plants their feet**. The atgeir's butt strikes the ground with finality. The point angles forward, creating a wall of sharpened steel. In this moment, the Atgeir-wielder ceases to be a mobile combatant and becomes a **temporary fortification**.

Enemies may hammer against this stance. They may try to shove, to drag, to knock the warrior from their footing. But the Atgeir-wielder has trained for this exact moment—feet braced, weight distributed, every muscle locked into perfect stability.

### Thematic Resonance

Disciplined Stance is the Atgeir-wielder's commitment to position over mobility—proof that sometimes the strongest move is to not move at all.
