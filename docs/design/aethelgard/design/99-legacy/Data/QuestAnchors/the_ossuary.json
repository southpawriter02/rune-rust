  "Description": "Bones. So many bones. Workers who never made it out, laid to rest in neat rows by... something. The Symbiotic Plate has claimed them now, threading through skeletal remains, assembling them into new, terrible forms.",
  "Archetype": "Chamber",
  "SuggestedNodeType": "Main",
  "NarrativeText": "When The Great Silence came, thousands died in [The Roots]. Someone - or something - gathered their remains here. The Bone-Keepers guard this place now, skeletal constructs animated by fungal intelligence. They defend the dead with horrifying efficiency.",
  "FlavorText": "Skulls watch from alcoves carved into the walls. Personal effects scatter among the bones - rusted tools, tarnished jewelry, faded photographs. The Symbiotic Plate pulses softly, keeping the dead... alive. You hear whispers, but there's no one to whisper.",
