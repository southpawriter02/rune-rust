## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

The Unspoken Truth is the Jötun-Reader's **signature psychological assault**—the weaponization of pure, undeniable lore. This is not magic; it is a surgical strike using information so devastating that it shatters the enemy's cognitive coherence.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Apply [Disoriented] debuff via knowledge attack
- **Secondary:** Non-magical mental control for Adepts
- **Restriction:** Only works on [Intelligent] targets
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The truth that breaks minds

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High (reliable debuff)
- **Target Restriction:** Intelligent enemies only
- **Skill-Based:** Success requires WITS + Rhetoric check
- **Thematic Unique:** Only knowledge-based mental attack in game

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Jötun-Reader draws from their encyclopedic knowledge to recall a piece of **forbidden, forgotten, or traumatic lore** specific to their enemy—and speaks it aloud.

*To a God-Sleeper Cultist:* "Your 'god' is not a god. It is a broken weapon, screaming in a cage of its own failed logic!"

*To an Einherjar Prime:* "I have read your prime directive. You were built to protect the very people you now slaughter. You are a failure."

The enemy's worldview cracks. Their coherence shatters.

### Thematic Resonance

The Unspoken Truth transforms lore into a weapon—proof that the right words can wound more deeply than any blade.
