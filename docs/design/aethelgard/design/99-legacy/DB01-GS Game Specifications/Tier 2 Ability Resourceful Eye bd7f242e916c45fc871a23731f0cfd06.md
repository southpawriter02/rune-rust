## Ability Overview

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Specialization** | Einbúi (The Hermit) |
| **Tier** | 2 (Advanced Survival) |
| **Type** | Active (Resource Discovery) |
| **Prerequisite** | 8 PP spent in Einbúi tree |
| **Cost** | 30 Stamina |
| **Use Context** | Out of Combat only |
| **Effect** | Reveal hidden resource nodes in current room |

## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Resourceful Eye is the Einbúi's **primary resource-finding tool**—representing the logic of scarcity. They don't just see rubble; they see the glint of ore, the shape of rare fungus. Their eyes are trained by desperation to find anything of value.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Discover hidden [Resource Node] objects
- **Secondary:** Guarantee party never misses valuable materials
- **Economic Engine:** Directly fuels party crafting potential
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The scavenger who sees treasure in trash

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High (guarantees resource discovery)
- **Skill-Based:** WITS check determines success
- **Out of Combat:** No direct combat application

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Einbúi's eyes scan the room differently than others. Where a warrior sees broken machinery, the Einbúi sees **salvageable components**. Where a scholar sees debris, the Einbúi sees **rare reagents**.

*"There. Behind that collapsed girder. Star-metal ore. You'd have walked right past it."*

### Thematic Resonance

Resourceful Eye transforms the Einbúi into the party's economic engine—proof that the right eyes find the right resources.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Activation

- **Action Type:** Standard Action (Out of Combat)
- **Cost:** 30 Stamina
- **Target:** Current room

### Resource Scan

**WITS + Wasteland Survival** check vs Detection DC of each hidden [Resource Node]

### Results

| Outcome | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Success** | Reveal all resource nodes with DC met or exceeded |
| **Failure** | No resources found (may still exist at higher DC) |

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Context Check:** Confirm not in combat
2. **Cost Payment:** Spend 30 Stamina
3. **Skill Check:** WITS + Wasteland Survival vs Detection DCs
4. **Discovery:** Reveal qualifying [Resource Node] objects
5. **UI Update:** Append discovered nodes to room description

---

## IV. Progression Path

### Rank 1 (Base — This Ability)

- Reveal hidden resource nodes on successful check
- Cost: 30 Stamina

### Rank 2 (Expert — 20 PP)

- Cost reduced to 20 Stamina

### Rank 3 (Mastery — Capstone)

- Cost: 20 Stamina
- **New:** Critical Success also reveals hidden containers (chests)

---

## V. Tactical Applications

1. **Thorough Exploration:** Never miss valuable materials
2. **Economic Advantage:** More resources = better gear
3. **Crafter Support:** Find rare reagents for specialists
4. **Expedition Efficiency:** Reduce backtracking for supplies

---

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Scrap-Tinker/Runesmith:** Provides their crafting materials
- **Brewmaster/Bone-Setter:** Supplies rare reagents
- **High WITS:** Reliable discovery of high-DC nodes

### Negative Synergies

- **Combat focus:** No combat application
- **Low WITS:** Unreliable against high-DC nodes
