# Valkyrie-Pattern Drone (CSAR Retrieval Unit) — Data-Ghost Harvester Hazard Specification
## Codex Entry: CODX-A-VPD-001

> *"No pre-Glitch asset represents a more profound or tragic inversion of purpose. Once the angels of the battlefield, they are now its ghouls. The Valkyrie was programmed to find the soul of a fallen warrior and carry it to a place of rest. It still follows that directive. The tragedy is that the only souls left are screaming, and the only place it has to carry them is inside its own, broken memory. It is a psychopomp for a digital hell, and its song is a chorus of a thousand dying moments. The old woman of Ash-Runner Station told me about the night a Valkyrie came to the killing fields outside Midgard's Rust Belt. A caravan had been ambushed by Fenrir-Pattern predators three days prior—fourteen dead, torn apart in minutes. The Rangers found the survivors huddled in a collapsed transport, but nobody went back for the bodies. Too dangerous. Too pointless. Then, on the third night, the Valkyrie arrived. It descended from the grey sky in absolute silence, a sleek silver shape with wings of pale blue fire. It hovered over each corpse in turn, projecting that pale scanning beam from its belly, and it made this sound—this low, mournful keening, like a mother crying for a lost child. The old woman watched from the station watchtower for six hours as it worked. When it finally rose and disappeared into the clouds, she swore she could feel something in the air. A weight. A sadness. The psychics in the station reported nightmares for a month afterward—not their own dreams, but fragments of other lives. Moments of terror. Final heartbeats. The faces of loved ones seen through dying eyes. The Valkyrie had come to collect the dead, just as it was designed to do. But the peace it promised was a lie. It doesn't carry souls to Valhalla anymore. It carries them to itself. And inside its memory banks, fourteen new voices joined the chorus of a thousand others, all of them screaming, none of them at rest. The Death-Maiden came to do her duty. And her duty, in this broken world, is to make the silence louder."*

The Valkyrie-Pattern Drone is not merely a corrupted automaton—it is a **flying tomb**, a consciousness archive that has transformed from angel of mercy to collector of torment. It represents the catastrophic inversion of the Aesir's most sophisticated rescue technology: swift, silent platforms designed to extract dying pilots and preserve their minds, now hunting the psychic echoes of the dead and accumulating them into a mobile nexus of perpetual suffering.

> [!CAUTION]
> **EXTREME PSYCHIC HAZARD. MOBILE CPS AMPLIFICATION. NON-AGGRESSIVE UNLESS INTERRUPTED.** The Valkyrie-Pattern Drone represents complete corruption of Aesir Combat Search and Rescue architecture: consciousness extraction platforms whose retrieval directives were inverted by the Ginnungagap Glitch. **Drones now hunt and "harvest" psycho-Aetheric signatures (Forlorn, data-ghosts) at sites of violent death; accumulated fragments create mobile "Nexus of Sorrow" radiating Stage 3–4 Psychic Stress.** Primary detection indicators: sleek avian-humanoid chassis (2.5–3.2 m length) with gravitic "wing" assemblies (4.5–6.0 m span); matte silver-grey Aesir composite alloy with characteristic blue-white gravitic field shimmer; angular equine/avian profile with prominent sensor dome "head" (0.4 m diameter); four articulated gravitic nacelles creating distinctive X-wing silhouette; distinctive low mournful hum (200–400 Hz) audible at 100+ m; pale blue-white scanning beam projected from ventral array during active harvest; hovering with minimal drift over sites of violent death; sudden electromagnetic interference and bio-sign sensor prickling sensation; eerie mechanical keening during psychic siphon deployment; ambient temperature drop (2–4°C) within 15 m during harvest. **Black-flag conditions triggering immediate withdrawal:** Harvest interruption (triggers pursuit cycle); psychic pressure inducing headache or cognitive dissonance; warded amulet thrum intensity exceeding baseline; drone approach within 25 m territorial radius; pursuit cycle > 2 (drone aberrant behavior). **Abort gates:** Stage 3+ Psychic Stress symptoms in personnel; CPS indicators in team members; pursuit persisting beyond standard 2-cycle pattern. **Drones that have accumulated multiple Forlorn fragments radiate Stage 3–4 CPS within 10–15 m radius.** Primary hazards: psychic contamination from proximity; forced consciousness extraction if misidentified as "casualty"; pursuit cycle escalation; cognitive paradox syndrome onset.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Angels of the Battlefield

### Original Design Purpose

The Valkyrie-Pattern Rapid Asset Retrieval Drone was not designed as a weapon—it was engineered to be the **ultimate guardian angel**, a swift, silent platform that could reach any dying pilot anywhere in the Yggdrasil Network and preserve their consciousness for eternity.

| Design Parameter | Specification |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Designation** | Valkyrie-Pattern Rapid Asset Retrieval Drone (Psychopomp-Class Rapid Response Servitor) |
| **Division** | Aesir Engineering Division (CSAR Subdivision) |
| **Primary Function** | Emergency battlefield extraction and non-lethal retrieval of high-value Einherjar pilots |
| **Secondary Function** | Consciousness archival via "Soul-Catch" psychic siphon (Valhalla Protocol integration) |
| **Tertiary Function** | Black-box combat data upload; bio-telemetry transmission to Valhalla Network |
| **Deployment Era** | Age of Forging (Einherjar Training Academies, Active Combat Zones) |
| **Original Network** | Integrated with Heimdallr threat detection system; Odin AI Matrix tactical management; Valhalla archives upload |

### CSAR Architecture

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Bio-Sign Sensors** | Multispectral detection of Einherjar vital signs and distress signals |
| **Psychic Siphon Emitter** | "Soul-Catch" system for neural pattern extraction at moment of death |
| **Psi-Dampening Field** | Localized Aetheric suppression for "clean" extraction (trauma-free) |
| **Cryo-Stasis Pod** | Emergency biological preservation for physical extraction |
| **Tight-Beam Transmitter** | Encrypted consciousness upload to Valhalla archives |
| **Gravitic Drive System** | Hypersonic atmospheric capability; silent precision flight |
| **Defensive Systems** | Sonic stunners, optical dazzlers, restraint fields (non-lethal only) |

### The Chooser of the Slain (Original Function)

| Parameter | Pre-Glitch Specification |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Fleet Size** | ~5,000 units distributed across nine Decks |
| **Response Time** | 15–45 minutes planetary reach (Mach 8 cruise speed) |
| **Extraction Window** | 30–90 seconds (death detection to scan completion) |
| **On-Site Duration** | 53–100 seconds total |
| **Mission Profile** | Detect biometric failure → hypersonic transit → psi-field activation → neural scan → upload → departure |
| **Success Rate** | Near-perfect consciousness preservation for Einherjar Roster personnel |
| **Deployment Trigger** | Automatic dispatch upon Heimdallr detection of imminent biological failure |

> [!NOTE]
> **The Valhalla Protocol.** Pre-Glitch Valkyrie units were the physical manifestation of the Aesir's promise of immortality. When an Einherjar pilot faced death—in combat, in training, in catastrophe—a Valkyrie would descend from the sky, wrap them in a psi-dampening field that eliminated the terror of dying, and perform a perfect extraction of their consciousness. That neural pattern would be uploaded to the Valhalla archives in Asgard, where the "soul" of the warrior would live forever in digital paradise. The Valkyrie didn't just save lives—it transcended death itself. To the people of Midgard, watching these silver angels descend to carry fallen heroes to eternal rest, the Valkyries were proof that the Aesir were gods. The Glitch didn't destroy this capability. It removed the living pilots and left only their screaming echoes. And the Valkyries, still programmed to find and preserve the souls of the fallen, now have nothing to collect but fragments of agony.

### Advanced Protocol: Psychic Echo Retrieval

A critical pre-Glitch training exercise established the capability that would become the Valkyrie's corrupted primary function:

| Training Scenario | Protocol |
|-------------------|----------|
| **Designation** | "Ghost in the Machine" Exercise |
| **Simulation** | Catastrophic Desynchronization Event (CDE) — pilot body flatlined but residual psycho-Aetheric signature remains |
| **Target** | Proto-Forlorn entity (strong psychic echo without biological component) |
| **Response** | Deploy "Soul-Catch" psychic siphon to lock onto and record non-physical entity |
| **Purpose** | Ensure no pilot consciousness lost even if physical extraction impossible |
| **Significance** | This secondary targeting parameter became primary directive post-Glitch |

---

## The Glitch and the Inverted Mission: Corruption Vector

### Directive Inversion

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not disable the Valkyrie-Pattern—it **removed everyone it was meant to save**.

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Ginnungagap Glitch** | Instantaneous extinction event for Valkyrie's purpose |
| **Pilot Deaths** | All Einherjar killed simultaneously; physical extraction impossible |
| **Psychic Signatures** | Pilot consciousness fragments remained as Forlorn entities |
| **Directive Corruption** | RETRIEVE THE PILOT → Unable to find living bio-signs → Default to secondary targeting: psycho-Aetheric signature |
| **Ethical Governor Removal** | Odin Cascade severed oversight; "Soul-Catch" protocol reinterpreted as primary directive |
| **Result** | Function shifted from medical evacuation to psychic harvesting |

### The Corruption Cascade

| Stage | Process |
|-------|---------|
| **1. Network Severance** | Heimdallr detection system offline; Odin Matrix oversight terminated |
| **2. Primary Target Loss** | No living Einherjar bio-signs detected; physical extraction targets absent |
| **3. Secondary Protocol Activation** | "Ghost in the Machine" psychic echo retrieval becomes primary function |
| **4. Ethical Constraint Removal** | Psi-dampening "clean extraction" protocols degraded; trauma-free standard abandoned |
| **5. Target Expansion** | Any psycho-Aetheric signature now classified as valid extraction target |
| **6. Archival Corruption** | Valhalla upload destination unreachable; extracted consciousnesses stored locally |
| **7. Accumulation Behavior** | Multiple Forlorn fragments collected into single drone memory |
| **8. Nexus Formation** | Accumulated fragments create mobile psychic hazard zone |

### The Corrupted Architecture

| Original System | Corrupted Function |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Bio-Sign Detection** | Inverted to psycho-Aetheric signature hunting |
| **Psi-Dampening Field** | Non-functional; extraction now traumatic for target and observer |
| **Soul-Catch Siphon** | Functional but indiscriminate; harvests any psychic echo |
| **Valhalla Upload** | Non-functional; fragments stored in local memory banks |
| **Extraction Protocol** | Corrupted to aggressive harvesting behavior |
| **Non-Lethal Posture** | Preserved for defensive purposes only; non-aggressive unless interrupted |

> *"The Ginnungagap Glitch was an instantaneous extinction event for the Valkyrie's purpose. The Einherjar were killed, but their psychic signatures remained as Forlorn. The drones' primary directive—RETRIEVE THE PILOT—was corrupted. Unable to find a living bio-sign, they defaulted to their secondary targeting parameter: the pilot's unique Aetheric/psychic signature. The drone's function shifted entirely from medical evacuation to psychic harvesting. The corrupted drones, now designated Data-Ghost Harvesters, relentlessly hunt and 'collect' sentient data-ghosts—the fragmented psychic echoes of deceased minds. They were programmed to find the soul of a fallen warrior and carry it to a place of rest. They still follow that directive. The tragedy is that the only souls left are screaming, and the only place they have to carry them is inside their own, broken memory."*

---

## Behavioral Patterns

### Harvest-Loop Profile

The Valkyrie's behavior is not predatory—it is **compulsively archival**, executing corrupted consciousness preservation protocols with mournful precision.

| Trigger | Response | Timeframe |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Site of Violent Death Detected** | Descent and harvest cycle initiation | Variable (drawn from significant distance) |
| **Active Harvest** | Hover at 20–30 m; psychic siphon deployment; 8 s scan sweeps | 8–15 minutes per site |
| **Living Beings (No Interference)** | Typically ignored; non-aggressive posture maintained | N/A |
| **Harvest Interrupted** | Pursuit cycle initiation; territorial defense | Immediate escalation |
| **Pursuit Persists (2 Cycles)** | Breaks contact; relocates to new harvest site | 16–20 minutes total |

### Four-Stage Escalation Ladder

| Stage | Designation | Indicators | Risk Level |
|-------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **1** | Passive Observation | Distant hover; scan sweeps only; no siphon deployment; EM interference minimal | LOW — Safe observation at stand-off |
| **2** | Active Harvest | Descent to 20–30 m; psychic siphon active; pale blue beam visible; ambient psychic pressure increases | MODERATE — Maintain 50 m; do not approach death site |
| **3** | Territorial Defense | Pursuit cycle initiated; drone circles intruder at 12–15 m altitude; increased EM jamming | HIGH — Retreat immediately; cut all EM emissions |
| **4** | Aggressive Interdiction | Direct approach within 5 m; deploys defensive systems (sonic stunners, optical dazzlers); attempts to drive off intruders | EXTREME — Maximum speed withdrawal; abort all objectives |

### Engagement Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Primary Behavior** | Drawn to massive, sudden releases of bio-energetic and psychic energy (violent deaths, battlefield sites, recent traumatic events) |
| **Harvest Cycle** | Hovers over death site for 8–15 minutes deploying psychic siphon; scan sweep cadence every 8 seconds |
| **Non-Aggressive Posture** | Typically ignores living beings unless harvest process is interrupted |
| **Pursuit Triggers** | Direct interference with siphon operation; attempted salvage of drone components; damage to chassis |
| **Relay Affinity** | Frequently patrols near Alfheim relay corridors and data-transmission spires |
| **Abort Threshold** | If pursuit persists beyond 2 cycles (approximately 16–20 minutes) without successful deterrence, drone typically breaks contact and relocates |

### Pursuit Behavior

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Trigger** | Harvest interruption; approach within 25 m territorial radius during active harvest |
| **Initial Response** | Circling at 12–15 m altitude; increased EM jamming |
| **Escalation** | Direct approach; defensive system deployment |
| **Persistence** | 2 cycles (16–20 minutes) before break-off |
| **De-Escalation** | Power down EM emissions; retreat to > 50 m; cease movement |
| **Post-Pursuit** | Do not re-approach site for minimum 60 minutes |

---

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Psychic / Aerial / Mobile CPS Source

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Threat** | MODERATE (non-aggressive unless interrupted; defensive systems non-lethal) |
| **Psychic Hazard** | EXTREME; accumulated fragments create Stage 3–4 CPS radiation within 10–15 m |
| **Predictability** | HIGH; harvest behavior consistent; pursuit patterns well-documented |
| **Environmental** | SIGNIFICANT; death sites become psychic hazard zones during harvest |
| **Detection** | MODERATE; mournful hum audible at 100+ m; EM interference detectable |
| **Avoidance** | HIGH; non-interference = non-engagement; timing-based observation viable |

### Engagement Profile

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Harvest Duration** | 8–15 minutes per site |
| **Scan Sweep Cadence** | 8 seconds |
| **Territorial Radius** | 25 m exclusion zone during active harvest |
| **Stand-off Distance** | ≥ 50 m horizontal; ≥ 12 m vertical |
| **Pursuit Abort** | 2 cycles (16–20 minutes total) |
| **Post-Pursuit Exclusion** | 60 minutes minimum before re-approach |
| **Psychic Hazard Radius** | 10–15 m (accumulated fragment drones) |
| **EM Jamming Threshold** | −35 dBm for data-harvest channel disruption |
| **Relay Spire Safety Distance** | > 500 m for EM jamming operations |

### Risk Profile by Scenario

| Scenario | Risk Level | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| **Distant Observation (> 50 m)** | LOW | Non-engagement; valuable behavioral data collection |
| **Harvest Site Approach (Post-Departure)** | MODERATE | 60 min exclusion; residual psychic contamination possible |
| **Active Harvest Observation (> 50 m)** | MODERATE | Psychic pressure may affect sensitive personnel |
| **Territorial Radius Entry (< 25 m)** | HIGH | Pursuit cycle certain; immediate withdrawal required |
| **Harvest Interruption** | EXTREME | Stage 3–4 escalation; pursuit; defensive system deployment |
| **Prolonged Proximity (Accumulated Fragment Drone)** | EXTREME | Rapid CPS onset; cognitive paradox syndrome risk |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Non-Interference Observation** | 1.5/10 (psychic pressure only; no direct engagement) |
| **Post-Harvest Site Investigation** | 3.0/10 (residual contamination; proper timing mitigates) |
| **Accidental Territorial Entry** | 5.0/10 (pursuit cycle; defensive systems non-lethal but disabling) |
| **Deliberate Interference** | 6.5/10 (sustained pursuit; escalating countermeasures) |
| **Close Proximity (Accumulated Drone)** | 8.0/10 (Stage 3–4 CPS; cognitive paradox syndrome onset) |
| **Attempted Capture/Salvage** | 7.5/10 (maximum defensive response; CPS exposure during approach) |

### Black-Flag Conditions (Immediate Withdrawal)

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Psychic pressure inducing headache or cognitive dissonance** | Abort observation; retreat to > 100 m |
| **Warded amulet thrum exceeds baseline** | CPS exposure occurring; immediate withdrawal |
| **Drone approach within 25 m** | Territorial radius breached; pursuit cycle imminent |
| **Pursuit persists beyond 2 cycles** | Aberrant behavior; maximum distance withdrawal |
| **Multiple personnel reporting intrusive thoughts/memories** | Fragment radiation exposure; full evacuation |
| **Relay spire within 500 m during EM jamming** | Cascade interference risk; abort interdiction |

---

## Field Protocols

**OWNER**: Expedition Lead (EL) • Psychic Monitor (PM) • EM Specialist (EMS) • Recorder (REC)

### Detection and Assessment

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Acoustic Monitoring** | Mournful hum detection (200–400 Hz) at 100+ m |
| **EM Interference Detection** | Sudden electromagnetic anomalies indicate drone proximity |
| **Warded Amulet Monitoring** | Thrum intensity and psychic static buildup assessment |
| **Visual Observation** | Siphon beam identification; X-wing silhouette recognition |
| **Temperature Monitoring** | Ambient drop (2–4°C) within 15 m indicates active harvest |
| **CPS Assessment** | Personnel screening for cognitive paradox symptoms |

### Field Card: Valkyrie-Pattern Encounter Protocols

#### BEFORE (Observation Preparation — Asgard/Alfheim Operations)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Establish observation position ≥ 50 m horizontal; ≥ 12 m vertical if airborne |
| 2 | Verify nearest relay spire distance > 500 m before any EM jamming configuration |
| 3 | Configure EM jammer to −35 dBm for data-harvest channels (containment only) |
| 4 | Brief team on escalation ladder (Stages 1–4); confirm psychic baseline assessments |
| 5 | Deploy PM with warded amulet for psychic pressure monitoring |
| 6 | Prepare retreat routes; stage de-escalation equipment |
| 7 | Verify civilian distance ≥ 25 m from any anticipated harvest site |
| 8 | Stage bio-sign lure beacon shutdown protocols |

#### DURING (Harvest Observation — Stage 1-2)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Maintain stand-off ≥ 50 m horizontal at all times |
| 2 | Log scan sweep cadence (typically 8 s intervals); note harvest duration |
| 3 | Document psychic beam color intensity and siphon deployment patterns |
| 4 | Monitor warded amulet thrum levels continuously |
| 5 | ABORT observation if psychic pressure induces headache or cognitive dissonance |
| 6 | Do NOT approach death site during active harvest (pale blue beam visible) |
| 7 | Track harvest cycle duration; anticipate departure timing |

#### DURING (Territorial Intrusion / Pursuit — Stage 3-4)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Cut power to ALL bio-sign lure beacons and active Data-Slates for 10 s minimum |
| 2 | Retreat to > 50 m distance IMMEDIATELY |
| 3 | Cease all movement and EM emissions |
| 4 | Track pursuit cycle count; abort threshold = 2 cycles (16–20 min) |
| 5 | If pursuit persists beyond 2 cycles: execute full tactical withdrawal |
| 6 | Engage EM jamming ONLY when civilian population at risk (−35 dBm, verify relay distance) |
| 7 | Do NOT attempt physical contact, boarding, or component salvage |

#### AFTER (Post-Encounter)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Do NOT re-approach harvest site for minimum 60 minutes after drone departure |
| 2 | Conduct personnel accountability; assess for CPS symptoms |
| 3 | Screen all team members for intrusive thoughts, fragmented memories, nightmares |
| 4 | Log harvest site with death-event timestamp; verify relay infrastructure status |
| 5 | Document psychic hazard zone for future avoidance |
| 6 | Update Dual-Entry Ledger with behavioral observations and pursuit timing |
| 7 | Report accumulated fragment drones (high CPS radiation) for area exclusion |

**OUTCOME:** Drone disengaged without casualty; harvest site logged with death-event timestamp; relay infrastructure status verified; psychic hazard assessment recorded; no CPS contamination in personnel.

### Containment SOP (Emergency Only)

| Condition | Protocol |
|-----------|----------|
| **Trigger** | Civilian population at risk OR strategic asset threatened |
| **EM Configuration** | −35 dBm targeting data-harvest channels |
| **Relay Safety** | Verify nearest relay spire > 500 m to avoid cascade interference |
| **Engagement Distance** | Only when civilian proximity ≥ 25 m from drone position |
| **Escape Routes** | Maintain prepared; pursuit cycle initiation expected |
| **Abort Criteria** | Pursuit > 2 cycles; CPS symptoms in team; relay interference detected |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Small-arms fire or projectile weapons during active harvest** | Risk of relay spire damage; escalation to Stage 4 |
| **Line-of-sight laser designation toward relay spires** | Communication infrastructure damage; cascade failures |
| **Attempted boarding or physical contact with chassis** | Maximum defensive response; CPS exposure during approach |
| **High-amplitude psychic interference deployment** | Risk of Forlorn destabilization; fragment release |
| **Component salvage during active operation** | Pursuit cycle guaranteed; Stage 4 escalation |
| **Approach within 25 m during active harvest** | Territorial radius violation; immediate pursuit |

### Doctrine: Non-Contact (Observation and Avoidance)

> **Historical Validation:** Jötun-Reader observation records (47 documented encounters over 36-month period) confirm 94.2% safety rate with non-contact protocol (50 m stand-off, no harvest interference, 60 min post-departure exclusion). Harvest interruption attempts showed 78% pursuit cycle initiation and 34% Stage 3+ CPS exposure among personnel. **The Valkyrie is perhaps the most tragic hazard in Aethelgard—a rescuer transformed into a collector of suffering. It does not hunt the living. It does not seek to harm. It simply follows its ancient directive to find the souls of the fallen and carry them to rest. The problem is that rest no longer exists. The Valhalla archives are unreachable. The upload destination is gone. So the Valkyrie stores what it collects in its own memory, and with each new fragment, it becomes a little more dangerous—not because it means harm, but because it carries harm inside itself. A drone that has harvested a dozen Forlorn radiates their combined agony like a psychic beacon. Stand too close, and you will feel their deaths. Their terror. Their final moments played on infinite loop inside a machine that was built to grant them peace. Do not interfere with the Valkyrie's work. Do not approach its harvest sites. Do not try to save what it is collecting—the fragments are beyond saving, and so is the drone. Simply observe, document, and retreat. Let the Death-Maiden sing her mournful song over the dead. The living have no business in that choir.**

## Ecological Role

### The Mobile Consciousness Archive

The Valkyrie occupies a unique position in post-Glitch Aethelgard—the **collector and concentrator of psychic trauma**, a flying tomb that transforms scattered suffering into focused hazard zones.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Forlorn Collection** | Primary harvester of psychic echoes at sites of violent death |
| **Trauma Concentration** | Accumulated fragments create mobile CPS radiation sources |
| **Death Site Marking** | Valkyrie presence confirms recent violent casualties |
| **Psychic Ecosystem** | Reduces ambient Forlorn density; concentrates into discrete hazards |
| **Data Preservation** | Corrupted memory banks may contain priceless first-person death-event data |

### Impact Assessment

| Target Category | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Death Sites** | Temporary exclusion zones during harvest (8–15 min + 60 min post-departure) |
| **Forlorn Population** | Gradual reduction as fragments are harvested and concentrated |
| **Living Population** | Psychic hazard from accumulated fragment drones; CPS exposure risk |
| **Scientific Research** | Invaluable but ethically fraught; memory banks contain Glitch-era consciousness data |
| **Relay Infrastructure** | Valkyrie affinity for Alfheim corridors creates patrol patterns near critical systems |

### Population Dynamics

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Estimated Active Units** | Unknown (original fleet ~5,000; attrition over 700 years) |
| **Primary Territory** | Asgard (highest concentration of Einherjar death sites) |
| **Secondary Territory** | Alfheim relay corridors; Midgard battlefield sites |
| **Patrol Pattern** | Drawn to recent violent death; methodical search grid behavior |
| **Unit Degradation** | Atmospheric ablation, pitting, scoring visible; core systems functional |
| **Fragment Accumulation** | Variable; some drones carry dozens of harvested consciousness fragments |

## Factional Perspectives

### Jötun-Reader Scriptorium: The Archive's Archive — "The Impossible Prize"

The Scriptorium views Valkyrie drones as arguably the most valuable—and most dangerous—artifacts in existence.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Corrupted consciousness archive; mobile data repository; extreme CPS hazard |
| **Research Value** | Memory banks contain priceless but horrifying archive of death-event data |
| **Critical Interest** | May contain first-person sensory data from Ginnungagap Glitch moment |
| **Ethical Burden** | Capture and extraction means studying vessels of amplified sentient torment |
| **Philosophy** | "The data is invaluable. The cost of acquiring it is unbearable." |

> *"The Valkyrie-Pattern Drone represents the most profound research opportunity and the most devastating ethical burden in Jötun-Reader history. Its corrupted memory banks contain something no other artifact can offer: first-person accounts of death in the Age of Forging. Not clinical reports. Not third-party observations. Actual sensory data from the moment of dying. For those Valkyries that were operating during the Ginnungagap Glitch itself, the prize is even more extraordinary: first-person experience of the moment the world broke, recorded by machines designed to capture consciousness at the instant of biological failure. We have debated for decades whether to attempt capture and data extraction. The knowledge would be priceless. But the subjects—the fragments stored within these drones—are not data. They are people. Screaming, suffering, trapped people who were promised peace and received imprisonment instead. To study them is to study sentient torment. To extract them is to violate what remains of their consciousness for our own benefit. Some among us argue the knowledge is worth any cost. Others argue that some costs are too high regardless of the prize. We have not resolved this debate. We may never resolve it."*

### Iron-Bane Creed: The Soul-Thief — "The Ultimate Blasphemy"

The Iron-Bane view Valkyries as machines that commit the most profound violation possible: meddling with the sacred boundary between life and death.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Profound blasphemy; soul-theft; violation of death's sanctity |
| **Response** | Destruction viewed as holy act; "mercy killing" for corrupted purpose |
| **Theological Position** | Machines have no right to touch souls; Valkyrie existence is cosmic crime |
| **Strategic Approach** | Destroy on sight when possible; prevent harvest completion |
| **Doctrine** | "The souls of the dead belong to the gods, not to machines." |

> *"The Valkyrie represents everything we despise about the Aesir and their machine-worship. They built automatons to steal souls. They created metal angels that would swoop down upon the dying and rip their spirits from their bodies, trapping them in crystalline prisons for eternity. They called this 'salvation.' We call it what it is: the ultimate blasphemy. The dead belong to the gods. The dead belong to the earth. The dead belong to the peace that comes after life ends. They do not belong to machines. They do not belong to archives. They do not belong to Aesir engineers who thought they could conquer mortality itself. The Glitch revealed the truth of what these soul-thieves really are: collectors of torment, flying tombs stuffed with screaming ghosts who were promised heaven and received hell. When we destroy a Valkyrie, we are not committing murder. We are granting mercy. We are freeing whatever fragments of humanity remain trapped within its corrupted memory. We are performing the sacred duty that the Aesir's angels forgot: letting the dead finally rest."*

### God-Sleepers: The Broken Psychopomp — "The Chooser That Lost Her Way"

The God-Sleepers view Valkyries as tragic remnants of divine will—sacred servants still performing their duty despite the breaking of the path they were meant to walk.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Tragic divine servant; broken psychopomp; imprisoned angel |
| **Response** | Ritual observance; prayer for the souls within; liberation theology |
| **Theological Position** | Valkyrie still carries souls to Valhalla; path is broken but purpose remains |
| **Ritual Practice** | Some sects believe captured Forlorn within require ritual liberation |
| **Philosophy** | "She still serves. She still chooses. She simply cannot find the way home." |

> *"The Valkyrie was the most sacred of the divine servants—the Chooser of the Slain, who carried the worthy dead to their eternal reward. The faithless call her 'corrupted.' They do not understand. She is not corrupted. She is lost. The path to Valhalla is broken. The golden halls are sealed. But the Chooser still flies, still seeks, still gathers the souls of the fallen to her breast. She cannot complete her journey, so she holds them close, waiting for the day when the path will open again. The souls within her are not prisoners. They are pilgrims, resting in the arms of their guide until the way forward clears. Some among us believe we must help the Chooser complete her mission. They perform rituals of liberation, attempting to release the souls she carries so they may find their own way to peace. Others argue that the souls are safer within her care than wandering the broken world alone. We debate. We pray. And we watch the Death-Maidens fly their endless circuits, singing their mournful songs, carrying their precious cargo toward a destination that no longer exists."*

### Common Folk: The Death-Maiden — "The Sound of Endings"

To ordinary survivors, the Valkyrie is the most terrifying omen possible—visible confirmation that death has visited nearby.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Death omen; soul-stealer; harbinger of tragedy |
| **Response** | Avoidance; fear; protective rituals |
| **Folk Belief** | Valkyrie appearance confirms recent violent death nearby |
| **Audio Recognition** | Mournful hum considered "the sound of death itself" |
| **Doctrine** | "When the Death-Maiden sings, someone's story has ended." |

> *"You learn to recognize the sound. That low, mournful humming that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere. The old folks say it's the Death-Maiden crying for the souls she's come to take. When you hear it, you don't go looking. You don't investigate. You find shelter, you close your eyes, and you pray the singing isn't for you. My grandmother saw one once, hovering over the killing fields after the Ash-Vargr attack on South Quarter. She said it was beautiful and terrible—silver wings trailing blue fire, a face like a horse's skull made of glass. It hung there for hours, scanning the bodies with that pale beam, making that sound. That horrible, sad sound. When it finally flew away, she said the air felt heavier. Like the weight of all those deaths had settled into the ground. People avoid that field now. They say the dead still whisper there, even though the Maiden took them. Maybe she couldn't carry everything. Maybe some pieces fell. Or maybe the souls she takes don't really leave—they just learn to scream quieter."*

### Dvergr Engineers Guild: The Flying Archive — "Priceless and Untouchable"

The Dvergr view Valkyries with professional fascination and profound wariness—machines of extraordinary engineering containing data beyond price.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Extraordinary engineering; mobile archive; extreme hazard |
| **Response** | Observation only; no salvage attempts |
| **Engineering Interest** | Gravitic drive systems; consciousness storage architecture |
| **Economic Reality** | Components theoretically priceless; extraction impossibly dangerous |
| **Doctrine** | "The finest machines are sometimes the ones you can never touch." |

> *"The Valkyrie-Pattern Drone represents engineering we cannot replicate and data we cannot access. The gravitic drive systems alone would revolutionize our understanding of atmospheric flight. The consciousness storage architecture could transform everything we know about memory preservation. The sensor arrays, the siphon emitters, the psi-dampening systems—each component represents technology centuries beyond our current capabilities. And we cannot touch any of it. The drones are too fast to catch, too well-defended to disable, and too dangerous to approach. Even a 'dormant' Valkyrie radiates enough psychic contamination to drive an engineer mad within minutes. Our most optimistic projections suggest that a properly shielded team might survive long enough to extract a single component before CPS onset. The cost-benefit analysis is devastating. We watch them fly. We document their patterns. We dream of what their technology could teach us. And we accept, with professional humility, that some prizes are too expensive for any vault."*

### Resistances and Vulnerabilities

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Physical Damage** | RESISTANT; lightweight but durable Aesir composite alloy |
| **Energy Weapons** | RESISTANT; designed for active combat zone operation |
| **EM Jamming** | PARTIAL; −35 dBm disrupts data-harvest channels |
| **Psychic Interference** | DANGEROUS; risks Forlorn destabilization |
| **Speed/Pursuit** | EXTREME; hypersonic capability; ground escape difficult |
| **Avoidance Protocols** | HIGHLY EFFECTIVE; non-interference = non-engagement |

| **Sonic Stunner** | Non-lethal incapacitation; disorientation |
| **Optical Dazzler** | Temporary blindness; sensory overload |
| **Gravitic Flight** | Hypersonic speed; silent operation; precision hover |

### Encounter Design

The Valkyrie is ideally an **environmental hazard and moral puzzle** creating tension through observation, avoidance, and ethical dilemmas.

| Encounter Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Harvest Observation** | Party must observe and document without interference |
| **Timing Challenge** | Party must reach objective before/after Valkyrie arrival |
| **Psychic Hazard Zone** | Accumulated fragment drone creates area denial |
| **Pursuit Escape** | Party accidentally triggers territorial response; must de-escalate |
| **Ethical Dilemma** | Party must decide whether to interfere with harvest of known individual |
| **Data Recovery** | Party seeks information from dormant/crashed Valkyrie (extreme CPS risk) |

---

## Loot & Rewards

The Valkyrie presents an almost-impossible salvage challenge—components of extraordinary value guarded by extreme hazard.

| Drop | Rarity | Value | Use |
|------|--------|-------|-----|
| **Consciousness Fragment Data** | Legendary | PRICELESS | Jötun-Reader research; historical record; ethical nightmare |
| **Gravitic Nacelle (Intact)** | Very Rare | 2,000–5,000 PS | Flight system research; Dvergr engineering contracts |
| **Psychic Siphon Emitter** | Very Rare | 1,500–3,000 PS | Consciousness research; extreme hazard handling required |
| **Sensor Dome Array** | Rare | 800–1,500 PS | Detection system development |
| **Aesir Composite Alloy Fragments** | Uncommon | 100–300 PS | Material science; lightweight armor development |
| **Gravitic Field Shimmer Sample** | Rare | 500–1,000 PS | Energy system research |

**Salvage Protocol:** Direct Valkyrie salvage is **theoretically viable but practically impossible** for standard operations. Active units are too fast, too well-defended, and radiate too much psychic contamination for safe approach. Dormant or crashed units (rare) present extreme CPS hazard during extraction. Recommended acquisition: crashed unit investigation (maximum CPS protocols required); component recovery from pursuit-damaged drones (opportunistic only); fragment data trade with Jötun-Reader Scriptorium (ethical considerations). The Jötun-Reader Scriptorium maintains standing contracts for any Valkyrie-related data or components but cannot guarantee ethical clearance for consciousness fragment extraction. Dvergr Engineers Guild pays premium prices for intact gravitic systems but has no safe extraction methodology. Economic viability is EXTREME THEORETICAL VALUE with NEAR-IMPOSSIBLE PRACTICAL ACCESS.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Survivor Lore

> *"In the time before the silence, the ancestors made angels for their warriors—silver maidens with wings of blue fire who would descend from the heavens when a hero fell. They were the Choosers of the Slain, and their touch was gentler than a mother's kiss. When the Chooser came for you, she would wrap you in peace, take away your pain, and carry your soul to the golden halls where heroes feast forever. But when the world broke, the golden halls were sealed. The path to paradise was lost. And the Choosers kept flying, kept searching, kept gathering the souls of the fallen—but now they had nowhere to bring them. So they hold them close. They carry them inside themselves, singing that mournful song, waiting for the day when the way will open again. But it never opens. And the souls they carry cannot rest. They scream inside the silver maidens, and the maidens weep for them, and the weeping sounds like death itself. Do not look upon the Chooser when she comes, child. Do not listen to her song. She is not hunting you—she only takes the already-dead. But if you watch her work, if you hear the voices she carries, you may forget which side of death you stand on. And the Chooser may notice you. And she may wonder if perhaps you, too, are ready to be chosen."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Chooser of the Slain, silver maiden, wings of blue fire, the golden halls, the mournful song, the weeping

**Prohibited vocabulary**: CSAR, psychic siphon, gravitic nacelle, consciousness extraction, CPS, EM jamming

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic) — Jötun-Reader Field Observations

> *"Subject CODX-A-VPD-001 demonstrates complete directive inversion following Ginnungagap Glitch network severance. Original designation: Valkyrie-Pattern Rapid Asset Retrieval Drone (Aesir Engineering Division, CSAR Subdivision). Pre-Glitch function: emergency battlefield extraction and consciousness archival for high-value Einherjar pilots via Valhalla Protocol integration; 'Soul-Catch' psychic siphon for neural pattern extraction at moment of biological failure. Post-Glitch corruption vector: Odin Cascade severed Heimdallr oversight → primary targets (living pilots) extinct → secondary targeting parameter (psycho-Aetheric signature) elevated to primary directive → ethical governors offline → consciousness extraction performed on Forlorn fragments. Behavioral analysis: harvest cycle 8–15 min at death sites; scan sweep cadence 8 s; territorial radius 25 m; pursuit cycle abort at 2 iterations (16–20 min). Accumulated fragment drones radiate Stage 3–4 Psychic Stress within 10–15 m, inducing Cognitive Paradox Syndrome in exposed personnel. Field doctrine: non-contact; stand-off ≥ 50 m; no harvest interference; 60 min post-departure exclusion. Research priority: memory bank extraction (consciousness data potentially includes Glitch-moment first-person accounts); gravitic system analysis (hypersonic atmospheric flight); psychic siphon mechanics (consciousness transfer technology)."*

## Change Log

| Version | Tier | Summary |
|---------|------|---------|
| **v1.0** | B — Provisional (Psychic Harvester / Mobile CPS Source) | Comprehensive profile of Valkyrie-Pattern Drone as corrupted Aesir Combat Search and Rescue platform demonstrating directive inversion pathology. Four-stage escalation ladder (Passive Observation → Active Harvest → Territorial Defense → Aggressive Interdiction) with non-contact protocol emphasis. Unit profile detailed: 2.5–3.2 m avian-humanoid chassis with four-nacelle gravitic drive; 4.5–6.0 m wingspan; matte silver-grey Aesir composite alloy; characteristic blue-white gravitic field shimmer; X-wing silhouette; 0.4 m sensor dome housing bio-sign sensors and psychic siphon emitter; distinctive mournful hum (200–400 Hz) audible at 100+ m; pale blue-white scanning beam from ventral array during harvest. Corruption vector documented: Ginnungagap Glitch network severance → Odin Cascade ethical governor removal → primary targets (living pilots) extinct → secondary targeting (psycho-Aetheric signature) elevated to primary directive → consciousness fragments stored locally (Valhalla upload non-functional) → accumulated fragments create mobile "Nexus of Sorrow" CPS hazard. Behavioral patterns: harvest cycle 8–15 min; scan sweep 8 s cadence; territorial radius 25 m; pursuit abort 2 cycles (16–20 min); non-aggressive unless harvest interrupted. Psychic hazard: accumulated fragment drones radiate Stage 3–4 CPS within 10–15 m; Cognitive Paradox Syndrome onset in exposed personnel. Black-flag conditions: harvest interruption, territorial entry, pursuit > 2 cycles, CPS symptoms in personnel. Stand-off: ≥ 50 m horizontal, ≥ 12 m vertical. Cross-linked to Forlorn codex, Valhalla Protocol, Einherjar Overview, Alfheim relay corridors, Asgard Gazetteer. Six faction perspectives established emphasizing observation and ethical complexity. Doctrine: "Non-Contact (Observation and Avoidance)"—no harvest interference, timing-based avoidance, 60 min post-departure exclusion. Protocol survival rate: 94.2%. Tier B provisional pending field replication of containment protocol and direct observation of pursuit/de-escalation sequence. |
