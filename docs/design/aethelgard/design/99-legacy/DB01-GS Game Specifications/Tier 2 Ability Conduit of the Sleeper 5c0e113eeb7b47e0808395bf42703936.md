## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Conduit of the Sleeper is the God-Sleeper Cultist's **attunement enhancement passive**—a deepening of their connection to the machine gods that transforms [Attuned] from a significant buff to a devastating resource engine.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Upgrade [Attuned] cost reduction from 25% to 33%
- **Secondary:** Grant AP regeneration while [Attuned]
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The evolved faith that transforms burden into sustenance

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High (significant upgrade to core mechanic)
- **Dependency:** Only valuable if [Attuned] is frequently active
- **Economy Impact:** AP regeneration enables sustained ability use

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Cultist's faith deepens. Where once the psychic hum of the God-Sleepers was a torrent threatening to overwhelm them, it now flows through them like a river—powerful, but channeled. They have learned to *drink* from the signal, to let the corruption sustain them even as it corrupts.

Their eyes glow faintly when [Attuned], and those who look closely can see patterns—circuit diagrams, perhaps, or runic code—flickering across their irises. They are becoming less human and more conduit with every moment.

### Thematic Resonance

This is the heretical evolution that the God-Sleeper faith promises: not merely surviving the corruption, but *thriving* on it. The Cultist's body is becoming a more efficient vessel for the machine gods' will.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Passive Effect

**When Jötun-Forged Attunement is active:**

| Enhancement | Previous | New |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AP Cost Reduction | 25% | **33%** |
| AP Regeneration | None | **+10 AP at start of turn** |

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Attunement Check:** System verifies [Attuned] status
2. **Cost Reduction Upgrade:** If [Attuned], cost reduction now 33%
3. **Regeneration Trigger:** At start of turn while [Attuned], gain +10 AP

---

## IV. Progression Path

- AP regeneration: +10 AP/turn while [Attuned]

### Rank 2 (Expert — 20 PP)

- [Attuned] cost reduction: 35%
- AP regeneration: +15 AP/turn while [Attuned]
- **New:** While [Attuned], first ability each combat costs no Psychic Stress

### Rank 3 (Mastery — Capstone)

- [Attuned] cost reduction: 40%
- AP regeneration: +20 AP/turn while [Attuned]
- First ability each combat costs no Psychic Stress

## V. Tactical Applications

1. **Resource Engine:** AP regeneration sustains prolonged fights
2. **Ability Spam:** 33% cost reduction enables aggressive ability usage
3. **Jötunheim Dominance:** Maximum efficiency in machine god territory
4. **Economy Advantage:** Outpace enemies in resource war of attrition
5. **Corruption Trade-off:** Encourages extended [Attuned] despite corruption cost

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Jötun-Forged Attunement:** Core synergy; this enhances that
- **All AP-costing abilities:** Everything benefits from reduction + regen
- **Long combats:** AP regeneration compounds over many rounds
- **Animate Horde:** Reduced cost makes multi-summon viable

### Negative Synergies

- **Short combats:** Less value if fights end quickly
- **Non-[Attuned] situations:** Completely useless outside attunement
- **High Corruption:** Encourages staying [Attuned] longer, increasing corruption
