**Diagnostic Notes:** Shields transform combat dynamics by enabling active defense—the [Block] action allows a shield-wielder to negate incoming damage at the cost of their reaction. The trade-off is significant: a shield occupies the off-hand, preventing two-weapon fighting or two-handed weapon use. Warriors and defensive-focused builds favor shields; mobile skirmishers typically forgo them for offensive versatility.
