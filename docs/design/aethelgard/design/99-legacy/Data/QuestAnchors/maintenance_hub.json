  "Name": "[The Maintenance Hub]",
  "Description": "Central control for this sector of [The Roots]. If you could restore power... Diagnostic panels line the walls, dark and dormant. A massive power distribution node dominates the center of the room. Conduits spider web across the ceiling.",
  "Archetype": "Chamber",
  "SuggestedNodeType": "Main",
  "NarrativeText": "This hub controlled power, ventilation, and security for an entire sector. Restoring it would bring lights online, open locked doors, maybe even reactivate helpful systems. But the maintenance drones don't want you touching anything. They're protective of their domain.",
  "FlavorText": "Control panels display cryptic error messages in Old Aetheric. Schematics show the sector layout - shortcuts you could unlock if power were restored. Exposed wiring crackles with residual charge. The air smells like ozone and old copper.",
