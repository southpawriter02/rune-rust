## Core Identity

**Basic Concoction** crushes herbs into crude but effective remedies. Not refined medicine—**field expedient first aid** that keeps people alive without proper healers.

---

## Mechanics

### Cost

10 Stamina | **Components:** 1× [Common Herb] + 1× [Clean Cloth]

### Effect

Choose one:

- **[Crude Poultice]:** 2d6 HP healing
- **[Weak Stimulant]:** 15 Stamina restore

Can craft and hold up to **3 concoctions**. Using held concoction: **Free Action**

### Rank Progression

| Rank | PP Cost | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 2d6 HP / 15 Stamina, hold 3 |
| 2 | 20 | 3d6 HP / 20 Stamina, hold 5 |
| 3 | 35 | 4d6 HP / 30 Stamina (via Master Improviser), hold 5 |

## Tactical Applications

**Pre-Combat Prep:**

```
Craft 1: [Crude Poultice] (2d6 HP)
Craft 2: [Crude Poultice] (2d6 HP)  
Craft 3: [Weak Stimulant] (15 Stam)
Ready for combat with instant support!
```

**In Combat:**

- Use held concoctions as **Free Actions**
- Maintain ability to act (trap/attack) same turn
- Supplement primary healer

**Synergies:**

- **Master Improviser:** Doubles all values automatically
- **Live off the Land:** Auto-generates herbs daily
- **Extended expeditions:** Budget healing option

## Failure Modes

<aside>
⚠️

**Component Scarcity** — Ability blocked without [Common Herb] + [Clean Cloth]. Mechanical dungeons lack organic materials.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Action Economy** — Mid-combat crafting sacrifices tactical impact. Front-load during downtime, maintain 2-3 held items always.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Insufficient Healing** — Crude Poultice (2d6 = 7 avg) inadequate for emergency triage vs heavy damage. Supplements healers, doesn't replace.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Storage Limit** — 3 held max at Rank 1. Wrong mix discovered too late to fix. Craft balanced anticipating needs.
