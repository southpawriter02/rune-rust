## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Terrifying Howl is the Vargr-Born's **psychological warfare ability**—a weaponized blast of pure, uncorrupted primal energy that inflicts [Feared] and Psychic Stress on corrupted enemies. This inverts the Trauma Economy, turning coherence into offense.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Inflict [Feared] on all enemies in row for 2 rounds
- **Secondary:** Deal Psychic Stress to all affected enemies
- **Cost:** Stamina + Feral Fury (dual resource)
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The primal howl that shatters corrupted minds

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High (AoE crowd control)
- **Dual Resource Cost:** Requires Fury expenditure (opportunity cost)
- **Anti-Corruption Weapon:** Extra effective vs Blighted enemies
- **Trauma Economy Inversion:** Coherent warrior inflicts Stress on enemies

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Vargr-Born throws back their head and **howls**.

It is not just sound—it is a **broadcast of coherence**. A signal of pure, uncorrupted primal code that slams into minds already fractured by the Blight's static. To a stable mind, it is merely terrifying. To a corrupted mind, it is **agony**—a sudden, overwhelming intrusion of clarity that their broken psyche cannot process.

Enemies stagger, clutching their heads. Some flee. Some freeze. All of them know, in that moment, that they face something *older* than the Blight, something that remembers what the world was meant to be.

### Thematic Resonance

Terrifying Howl is the Vargr-Born as living antibody—their very existence a weapon against the Blight's corruption. They do not succumb to the Trauma Economy; they weaponize their rejection of it.
