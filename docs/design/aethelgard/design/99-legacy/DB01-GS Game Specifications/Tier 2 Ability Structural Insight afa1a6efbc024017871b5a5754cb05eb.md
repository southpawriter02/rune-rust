### **Ability Overview**

**Specialization:** Jötun-Reader (System Pathologist)

**Tier:** 2 (Advanced Tactical Support)

**Type:** Passive

**Prerequisite:** 8 PP spent in the Jötun-Reader tree

**Cost:** 4 PP

### **Description**

The Jötun-Reader develops an intuitive understanding of architecture and structural integrity through extensive study of Old World construction techniques and failure patterns. They can instantly assess a room's structural stability and identify tactical features through pattern recognition developed over years of field observation.

### **Mechanics**

**Effect:** The character **automatically** detects the following upon entering a room or area:

**Environmental Hazards:**

- **[Structurally Unstable]** features (unstable ceilings, crumbling floors, load-bearing walls near failure)
- Collapsible structures that could be triggered for tactical advantage
- Areas at risk of cave-in or structural collapse

**Tactical Features:**

- **[Cover]** objects (quality and durability of defensive positions)
- Destructible terrain elements
- Choke points and optimal defensive positions
- Environmental hazards that could be weaponized

**No Check Required:** This detection is automatic and costs no action.

### **Thematic Justification**

This represents the Jötun-Reader's forensic training applied to architecture. They've examined so many collapsed ruins and ancient fortifications that they can instantly "read" a room's structural narrative through stress cracks, corrosion patterns, and construction materials.

### **Progression & Milestones**

### **Rank 1 (Foundational)**

- **Effect:** Automatically detect [Structurally Unstable] features, [Cover] objects, tactical features
- **Range:** Current room/area only

### **Rank 2 (Expert)**

- **Unlocked:** 20 PP invested in Jötun-Reader tree
- **Range:** Current room + **adjacent visible areas**
- **Additional:** Can assess **exact structural integrity percentage** and **predict collapse triggers**
- **Special:** Once per combat, issue **warning shout** (Free Action) granting allies **+2d10 defensive checks** against hazard

### **Rank 3 (Mastery)**

- **Unlocked:** Capstone ability unlocked (35-40 PP in tree)
- **Range:** **Entire dungeon floor/facility section**
- **Weaponization:** Once per combat, call out weak point for **controlled collapse** (Standard Action + ally attack)
- **Ambush Prevention:** Automatically warn party of enemy ambush positions
- **Permanent Buff:** Party gains **+1 Defense** in analyzed areas

---

### **Integration Notes**

- **Tactical Awareness:** Enables informed tactical decisions about positioning and environmental exploitation
- **Safety Feature:** Prevents party from accidentally triggering structural collapses
- **Combat Enhancement:** Identifies cover and environmental advantages before engagement
- **Always-On:** Requires no action economy investment during exploration

### **Example Applications**

- **Ruined Hall:** "The ceiling's support beams are compromised. The eastern wall provides solid cover—it's load-bearing and made of reinforced adamant-weave."
- **Collapsed Facility:** "This floor is unstable over the maintenance tunnels. The northwestern corner is safe—it's built on bedrock foundation."

### **Synergies**

- **Navigational Bypass:** Detection enables informed use of bypass ability
- **Party Tacticians:** Warriors and Rangers benefit from cover/positioning information

### **Related Abilities**

- **Scholarly Acumen I** (Tier 1): General observational enhancement
- **Navigational Bypass** (Tier 2): Uses detected structural information for safer navigation
- **Calculated Triage** (Tier 3): Positional awareness extends to healing optimization
