## Thematic Description

> *"You mark the dangers for those who follow. A chalk symbol here, a cord there—your map saves lives."*
> 

The Hazard Map is the Ruin-Stalker's gift to future explorers. Using standardized symbols, colored cords, and careful documentation, you transform deadly zones into **navigable territory**. Your maps become the difference between safe passage and tragic loss.

## Mechanical Implementation

### Base Effect (Rank 1)

- **Cost**: 25 Stamina + 1 Mapping Component
- **Action**: Survey a room or corridor
- **Result**: Create a **Hazard Map**
- **Benefit**: Party members consulting map gain **+2d10** to avoid all marked hazards for exploration duration

### Rank 2

- **Persistence**: Map persists **between sessions**
- **Shareable**: Can be shared with other parties
- **Bonus**: +3d10 (up from +2d10)
- **PP Cost**: 4

### Rank 3

- **Reveals**: Map shows **optimal extraction routes** and **hidden caches**
- **Party Benefit**: Advantage on **all hazard-related checks** in mapped area
- **PP Cost**: 4

## Mapping Components

Required materials for creating Hazard Maps:

| Component | Purpose | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chalk | Wall markings | General stores |
| Colored cord | Route markers | Crafted or purchased |
| Parchment | Portable documentation | General stores |
| Charcoal | Quick sketches | Scavenged |

---

## Map Symbols (Layer 2 Standard)

| Symbol | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ▲ | Trap present |
| ○ | Anomaly zone |
| ✗ | Impassable |
| → | Safe route |
| ⬡ | Rally point |
| ☆ | Cache/loot |

---

## Synergies

### Internal (Ruin-Stalker Tree)

- **Anomaly Sense I**: Detection feeds into mapping
- **Careful Advance**: Discovers routes to document
- **Safe Extraction Protocol**: Uses mapped extraction routes
- **Corridor Maker**: Systematic Survey enhances mapping

### External (Party Composition)

- **Future expeditions**: Persistent maps benefit later parties
- **Large operations**: Shared maps coordinate multiple teams
- **Jötun-Reader**: Can annotate maps with translation notes

---

## Tactical Applications

### Standard Mapping Protocol

1. Complete initial survey with Anomaly Sense
2. Document all hazards with standard symbols
3. Mark safe routes and rally points
4. Share map with party before entry

### Rank 3: Hidden Caches

Maps reveal locations that casual observation misses:

- Concealed storage compartments
- Old World supply caches
- Hidden passages
- Valuable salvage locations

## v5.0 Compliance Notes

✅ **Technology, Not Magic**: Physical mapping tools and techniques

✅ **Persistent Value**: Maps outlast single sessions

✅ **Team Utility**: Benefits entire party and future expeditions

✅ **Layer 2 Voice**: Standardized survey and cartography protocols
