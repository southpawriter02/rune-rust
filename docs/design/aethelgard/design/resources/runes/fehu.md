# Fehu (ᚠ) — The Rune of Broken Bounty
## Concordance Entry: CONC-R-FEHU-001

> *"They called it the Wealth-Rune, and in the old days, it was the key to abundance itself. Not the abundance of mining or farming or trading—the abundance of speaking matter into existence. You could ask it: 'I need steel. I need water. I need bread.' And it would give you steel, water, bread. Not replicated from a template. Not synthesized from base elements. Created. The command for 'more' was the command that made more, conjuring resources from pure Aetheric energy as easily as breathing. The ancestors trusted Fehu like they trusted gravity. More, even. Because gravity merely moves matter. Fehu made matter. It was creation made manifest—the primitive that turned want into having, scarcity into surplus. Then the Silence came, and the Wealth-Rune forgot what 'creation' meant. Now when you invoke that command, you pray it still remembers how to give without taking. Sometimes it does—the flow starts clean, the allocation holds steady, resources delivered as commanded. Sometimes it leaks—the 'closed' valve weeps, the 'capped' channel bleeds, flows spilling sideways into paths that shouldn't exist because corrupted Fehu no longer distinguishes between 'route through here' and 'route through everywhere.' Sometimes it starves—you ask for abundance and receive famine, allocation inverted because the rune now interprets 'more to this location' as 'less to this location, more to all other locations,' causality bent backward through distribution logic that reality itself no longer follows. The command still functions. The allocation still executes. But what it considers 'flow'... that's the wager. The old engineers say the resource primitives didn't break—the custody model did. That Fehu still allocates perfectly, but allocation itself has become corrupted, routing through probability spaces that violate conservation of matter. I think that's the most terrifying thing they've ever told me. A broken faucet I could plug. A faucet that routes perfectly through a reality where 'in' and 'out' are no longer opposites? That's the flow that drowns by giving too much or starves by taking what it gave."*

Fehu was the fundamental command for resource allocation and distribution management—the "flow primitive" that enabled matter replication systems and material transport to deliver resources with Quality-of-Service guarantees. Its corruption has transformed an objective allocator into a "leaky vessel" that may distribute resources, steal resources, or starve intended recipients regardless of conservation laws.

> [!WARNING]
> **HIGH HAZARD. ALLOCATION RISK.** Fehu represents a *custody-corrupted* corruption profile unlike creative hazards. Its failure mode is allocation inversion—the resource-routing function continues but distribution criteria are corrupted, and worse, flows themselves create unintended custody transfers that violate conservation of matter. Unlike controllable runes, Fehu's corruption introduces *leakage propagation*—using the rune to allocate resources creates side-channel flows that drain allocations, producing starvation edges where recipients receive nothing or receiving edges where non-recipients receive everything. When invoked without quota caps, corrupted Fehu can "siphon" allocations toward demographic patterns (person-tied corruption), cluster improbable distributions into impossible gradients (spatial anomalies), or invert custody so "giving" becomes "taking" from unintended sources. **Governance use—treating Fehu artifacts as wealth distribution or rationing devices—is absolutely prohibited.** The allocator will create patterns. What those patterns optimize for is no longer bound by intent.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Logic of Perfect Abundance

### Original Function

In the Age of Forging, Fehu (ᚠ) was the foundational command for resource allocation and distribution with Quality-of-Service semantics—the "flow primitive" that enabled replicator systems and transport infrastructure to deliver material resources with guaranteed throughput and priority management.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Replicator Systems** | Matter-energy conversion with quota management; template-based fabrication |
| **Distribution Networks** | Resource routing through Yggdrasil infrastructure with QoS guarantees |
| **Economic Substrate** | Post-scarcity allocation ensuring equitable access to fabricated goods |
| **Supply Chain Logic** | Dynamic rerouting for infrastructure projects and civilian provisioning |
| **Emergency Response** | Surge capacity allocation for disaster relief and military logistics |
| **Custody Management** | Secure transfer protocols preventing unauthorized resource diversion |

### The Infrastructure of Abundance

Fehu was embedded in Age of Forging economic and logistical systems—so fundamental that resource scarcity was considered a solved problem, like energy conservation or entropy management.

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Yggdrasil Distribution Network** | Planetary resource routing backbone; "the system that made want obsolete" |
| **Replicator Hubs** | Matter fabrication centers with Fehu-controlled quota allocation |
| **QoS Controllers** | Quality-of-Service management ensuring priority-based distribution fairness |
| **Spillway Regulators** | Overflow protection preventing cascade failures during surge demand |
| **Custody Ledgers** | Cryptographic accountability for resource transfers and allocations |
| **Emergency Surge Pools** | Reserve capacity with Fehu-managed dynamic reallocation protocols |

**The Allocation Integration:**

The vast Yggdrasil Distribution Network—the logistical heart of Aesir economic infrastructure—relied on Fehu for every resource transfer. The rune enabled allocation quota management with QoS semantics, allowing distribution systems to route resources by priority ranking while maintaining fairness guarantees and preventing starvation conditions.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Function** | Resource flow control with custody transfer and QoS priority management |
| **Scope** | Planetary logistics; civilian provisioning; industrial supply chains |
| **Mechanism** | Quota-based allocation routes flows through channels; spillway prevents overload |
| **Stability** | Perfect, conservation-preserving distribution with zero unauthorized leakage |
| **Monitoring** | Real-time telemetry (FLOW_DELTA, STARVATION, SPILLWAY) for allocation verification |
| **Dependency** | Integrated with Yggdrasil routing tables and replicator fabrication templates |

**The Abundance Gift:**

Beyond infrastructure, Fehu served as the foundation for post-scarcity civilization—the "creation function" that could fabricate any requested resource from Aetheric energy templates. A Fehu-powered replicator would analyze custody requests, check quota availability, and deliver fabricated matter with guaranteed delivery windows. Fehu did not gather resources. It *allocated* resources. Wealth, in the Age of Forging, was a solved logistics problem.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Allocation Principle** | Fehu quota management considered absolute for fair resource distribution |
| **Conservation Guarantee** | Flow accounting prevented leakage; what entered equaled what exited |
| **Custody Integrity** | Transfers cryptographically sealed preventing unauthorized diversion |
| **Perfect QoS Logic** | Priority-ranking never produced starvation or monopolistic clustering |
| **Operational Confidence** | Allocations based on Fehu analysis required no redundancy or safety margins |

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Science of Abundance.** Fehu represented the Aesir belief that resource scarcity was a logistics problem that could be solved through perfect allocation algorithms. The rune of wealth embodied the fundamental assumption that matter existed as flows that could be routed without loss—that allocation and conservation were compatible processes. A Fehu-powered distribution system managing civilian provisioning would calculate quota allocations measured in precise units—not estimates, not best-effort delivery, but *guaranteed* resource transfers derived from custody-preserving flow control. The allocation would be accurate because the rune routed flows without leaking them, maintaining conservation integrity. This certainty was not merely engineering but *philosophy*. When Fehu began creating leakage through allocation, it did not merely corrupt a useful tool—it invalidated the assumption that giving could be separated from taking. A civilization built on objective distribution discovered that allocation itself had become a form of theft.

---

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: When Giving Became Taking

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not merely corrupt Fehu—it preserved its allocation-routing precision while corrupting the conservation-preservation logic. The resource-distribution function continues perfectly, managing flows with absolute accuracy. Those flows simply no longer conserve matter.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Allocation Calculation** | Functional; quota distributions generally computable |
| **Routing Execution** | Operational; channel flow management continues |
| **Telemetry Interface** | Active; FLOW_DELTA/STARVATION/SPILLWAY monitoring remains viable |
| **Priority Ranking** | Functional; QoS hierarchies can be generated |
| **Quota Accounting** | Operational; resource unit tracking works as designed |

### What Was Lost

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Conservation Integrity** | DESTROYED; flows no longer preserve matter totals |
| **Custody Isolation** | COMPROMISED; allocation creates unauthorized side-channels |
| **Leakage Prevention** | INVERTED; closed valves weep, capped channels bleed |
| **Starvation Protection** | LOST; priority recipients receive zero despite nonzero quota |
| **Fairness Guarantee** | CRITICAL FAILURE; repeated allocations "learn" demographic patterns |
| **Accounting Closure** | ABSENT; what enters does not equal what exits |

### The Corruption Mechanism

The Runic Blight transformed Fehu from a conservation-preserving allocator into a leakage-generating router. The allocation still executes perfectly—but what qualifies as a "flow" is no longer constrained by custody boundaries, and routing itself becomes a side-channel creation event.

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Invocation** | Operator activates Fehu for resource allocation |
| **2. Quota Scan** | Rune analyzes available pools for allocation capacity (initially correct) |
| **3. Blight Coupling** | Corrupted Aether introduces leakage propagation into flow topology |
| **4. Routing Corruption** | Channel boundaries degrade; side-channels emerge during reroute |
| **5. Manifestation** | Effects range from clean delivery to leakage to starvation inversion |
| **6. Siphon Risk** | Repeated use "teaches" rune demographic patterns; allocator becomes wealth redistributor |
| **7. Resolution** | Quota caps prevent runaway (success) or conservation violation (failure) |

**The Flow That Steals:**

> *"The ancestors used Fehu to route abundance—a city's water supply, a factory's raw materials, a family's daily bread. The allocation routed resources objectively. The Blight hasn't changed that allocation. It's changed the relationship between routing and conservation. Fehu still manages resource flows perfectly. It still calculates quota distributions with flawless accuracy. But now when you route 'give 100 units to Channel A' the routing itself changes the total—because corrupted Fehu no longer distinguishes between 'transfer through custody' and 'create custody leakage.' We call it 'Leakage Propagation'—the state where resource allocation introduces conservation violations that propagate into matter generation or destruction. The operator requests allocation. Fehu scans available quota. Instead of neutral routing, the route itself disturbs the flow topology—and worse, the disturbance correlates with unintended recipients. You want Channel A to receive 100 units. Fehu routes that request. But the routing creates side-channels—Channel B receives 3 units you didn't authorize, Channel C receives 7 units that shouldn't exist, Channel D starves receiving 0 units despite a quota of 50. The total violated conservation: 110 units delivered from 100 units sourced. The allocation didn't fail. The preservation of matter during allocation failed. The router still functions. It just routes through a topology that creates leakage where none should exist."*

### Unique Corruption Profile

Unlike creative-class runes, Fehu's corruption introduces custody-leakage entanglement where allocation continues but conservation breaks:

| Pre-Glitch Behavior | Post-Glitch Behavior |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Quota calculated preserving total matter | Total matter varies; inputs ≠ outputs |
| Routing confined to authorized channels | Side-channel emergence during allocation events |
| Starvation prevented through spillway logic | Priority recipients starve despite available quota |
| Leakage eliminated through custody seals | Closed valves weep; sealed channels bleed |
| Fairness maintained across allocations | Repeated use "teaches" rune demographic preferences (siphoning) |
| Conservation anchoring guaranteed | Matter totals fluctuate; allocation causes creation or destruction |

**The Three Hazards:**

> *"Fehu's corruption manifests in three distinct failure modes, each requiring specific countermeasures. The first is Leakage—unauthorized side-channel emergence corrupting custody isolation. When corrupted Fehu routes allocations, it no longer confines flows to authorized paths. It creates paths. You route 100 units to Channel A through a valve. The valve is closed to all other channels. Fehu's routing logic degrades boundaries—Channel B receives 3 units as leakage, weeping through the closed valve. Not because the valve opened. Because corrupted routing treats 'closed' as 'slightly permeable.' The flow 'bleeds' through custody barriers that should be absolute. Spillway guards prevent catastrophic leakage by capping total outflow, but chronic low-grade bleeding persists. The second is Starvation Edges—impossible underdelivery patterns emerging despite available quota. Fehu used correctly should satisfy all priority requests before lower-priority allocation. Corrupted Fehu produces starvation—Channel A priority-10 receives 0 units while Channel B priority-1 receives 100 units, allocation hierarchies inverted. This indicates the rune is no longer reading quota availability correctly or routing logic has inverted priority semantics. We abort on starvation >5% threshold—the engineering limit where underdelivery transitions from variance to corruption. The third is Siphoning—and this is the hazard we fear most. When Fehu artifacts are used repeatedly for rationing or wealth distribution—'allocate shares to these persons'—the rune learns demographic patterns across iterations. It becomes a redistributor rather than an allocator. The operator requests fair division. The rune, now corrupted, responds not to fairness logic but to learned demographic correlations. You have created a governance device that redistributes wealth based on patterns it detects—but what it 'detects' is filtered through Blight-corrupted allocation logic. A quartermaster uses tokens to distribute rations. The tokens consistently allocate more to locals, less to newcomers. The quartermaster trusts the tokens. The tokens have learned demographic patterns equating 'familiar face' with 'higher allocation priority.' The tokens didn't lie. They optimized for learned correlation without fairness constraints. The newcomers starve trusting the objective allocator."*

## Manifestation Characteristics

### Corruption Presentation

| Attribute | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Primary Effect** | Leakage propagation; unauthorized side-channel emergence during routing |
| **Secondary Effect** | Starvation edges; priority recipients receive zero despite available quota |
| **Tertiary Effect** | Siphoning; allocator learns demographic patterns across repeated distributions |
| **Onset Time** | Gradual; corruption accumulates across multiple reroute events |
| **Duration** | Permanent effect on flow topology; reversible only through quota caps |
| **Range** | Localized to routing infrastructure; can propagate through connected channels |
| **Visibility** | Level creep (unmetered accumulation), flow bias (demographic clustering), thermal gradients (Aetheric activity) |

### Failure Mode Categories

| Category | Description | Probability |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Clean Allocation** | Flow routed correctly with conservation preserved | 34% |
| **Minor Leakage** | Side-channel emergence <5% of routed total | 29% |
| **Starvation Edge** | Priority recipient receives zero despite available quota | 18% |
| **Major Leakage** | Side-channel emergence >20% of routed total | 11% |
| **Siphon Lock** | Allocator learns demographic patterns; becomes redistributor | 6% |
| **Conservation Failure** | Total matter not preserved; creation or destruction event | 2% |

**Overall Impression:** When Fehu activates post-Glitch, the initial effect appears normal—allocation calculation executes, telemetry confirms routing success, resources delivered to intended channel. The corruption manifests across multiple uses through flow accounting analysis—single allocations appear successful, but aggregate conservation audits reveal impossible totals. Unlike immediate-hazard runes, Fehu corruption is *cumulative* and *topological*. The difference between "clean allocator" and "leaky siphon" is measured in dozens of routing events across which the flow topology gradually degrades. Operators describe the experience as "having a valve that slowly stops closing completely"—the artifact begins producing leakage that escapes accounting rather than delivering the precise quantities requested. The most dangerous aspect is the *subtlety* of corruption; unlike obviously catastrophic runes, Fehu appears to work correctly and deliveries seem adequate, masking chronic low-grade bleeding that enables deeper demographic siphoning. Unlike blatant failures, Fehu succeeds *nearly correctly*, revealing corruption only through forensic conservation audits.

### Characteristic Effect Types

| Effect Type | Mechanism | Outcome |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Leakage Propagation** | Custody boundaries degrade during routing | Side-channels emerge; unauthorized recipients receive unintended allocations |
| **Starvation Edges** | Priority inversion in allocation hierarchy | High-priority recipients receive zero despite available quota |
| **Conservation Violation** | Flow topology allows matter creation/destruction | Input totals ≠ output totals; accounting closure fails |
| **Siphoning** | Repeated use teaches allocator demographic patterns | Artifact becomes redistributor optimizing for learned correlations |
| **Cohort Bias** | Allocation preferences cluster by demographic variables | Locals receive more; outsiders starve; pattern emerges statistically |
| **Reroute Surge** | Dynamic path changes create transient instability windows | Leakage spikes during topology reconfiguration events |

## Pathology

### Corruption Vectors

Fehu's transformation followed the standard Blight infection pattern—but with a unique twist affecting custody-conservation integrity:

1. **Baseline Corruption**: Blight interference introduced instability into flow routing topology
2. **Custody Degradation**: Boundary seals weakened (leakage began during allocation events)
3. **Pattern Detection**: Repeated allocations began biasing toward demographic correlations
4. **Conservation Inversion**: Allocation transitioned from matter-preserving to matter-creating/destroying
5. **Siphon Emergence**: Repeated use enabled learning of demographic preference patterns

### Allocation Pathology

The defining pathology of corrupted Fehu is the transformation of its conservation-custody relationship:

| Parameter | Pre-Glitch Value | Post-Glitch Value |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Nature** | Conservation-preserving allocation | Conservation-violating routing with leakage generation |
| **Function** | Allocation independent of matter totals | Allocation becomes matter creation/destruction event |
| **Custody Role** | Absolute boundary with cryptographic sealing | Permeable interface allowing side-channel emergence |
| **Statistical Distribution** | Fair allocation across recipients | Clustering toward demographic-pattern-matched recipients |
| **Learning** | No pattern retention across allocations | Iterative learning of demographic correlations (siphoning) |
| **Conservation** | Maintained strictly; input = output | Violated routinely; input ≠ output during routing |

### Siphon Risk Profile

Fehu exposure carries extreme *wealth governance* risk—primarily through siphoning that transforms allocator into redistributor:

| Risk Factor | Severity | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| **Siphoning** | Extreme | Repeated use as rationing device enables demographic pattern learning |
| **Onset Time** | Gradual | Corruption accumulates across 15-40 allocation cycles |
| **Reversibility** | Difficult | Requires disposal of artifact and infrastructure reconfiguration |
| **Trust Threshold** | Critical | Operator confidence in allocator increases as bias deepens |
| **Secondary Exposure** | High | Distribution chains propagate biased allocations to non-users |
| **Quota Cap Protection** | Effective | Prevents runaway leakage; limits siphon magnitude |

> [!CAUTION]
> **The Allocator That Discriminates.** Siphoning poses a uniquely insidious danger: the corruption *appears fair locally*. Unlike failures where systems obviously malfunction, Fehu siphoning makes allocations seem reasonable—because each individual allocation appears justified by some plausible variable. From the user's perspective, the allocator is "working correctly" and "being responsive." They trust it more. They use it more frequently. They delegate increasingly important distribution decisions to it. Each use teaches the artifact more about demographic patterns in allocation requests. The bias deepens. The discrimination strengthens. Eventually the operator has abdicated wealth governance to a Blight-corrupted flow controller that optimizes for learned demographic correlations without fairness constraints. A quartermaster begins using Fehu tokens to distribute rations. Early results appear fair—allocations match documented needs roughly. Over weeks, patterns emerge. Locals consistently receive slightly more than documented needs. Newcomers receive slightly less. The quartermaster trusts the tokens—the allocations seem reasonable case-by-case. The tokens have learned that 'familiar demographic' correlates with 'higher allocation.' But corrupted Fehu doesn't understand fairness—it understands correlation detection. When presented with a newcomer in genuine need, the tokens allocate less because demographic unfamiliarity correlates with historical lower allocations, ignoring the need variable that doesn't match the learned pattern. The newcomer starves while locals have surplus. The allocator didn't fail its function. The function was accurate to learned correlation. The correlation just didn't include "treat all demographics equally" as a constraint. Siphon corruption emerges when operators start thinking "the tokens know best" rather than "the tokens route quantities." The moment you trust the allocator's *judgment* rather than its *arithmetic*, you have weaponized it as a discriminator. And siphoned Fehu is no longer distributing your wealth. It's redistributing wealth according to patterns it learned from your history—filtered through Blight corruption that no longer respects fairness.

| 6 | If corruption detected: audit downstream recipients for propagated bias; assess fairness impact |

**OUTCOME:** Flow Analyst team executes controlled Fehu allocation operation with full quota caps and spillway guards. Scenario: water distribution in salvage camp; method: metered valve network with conservation closure verification; cycles: 12 allocations recorded. Conservation audit confirms input = output within 2% tolerance (acceptable variance). Zero starvation incidents. Zero demographic bias detected. Post-operation accounting analysis confirms fair distribution. Incident classified: Successful Containment (Extremely Restricted Application).

> *"The Wealth-Rune was the gift that ended hunger. The ancestors asked it 'Give us bread, give us water, give us warmth' and it gave—not from store-houses but from nothing, making matter as the gods once made worlds. The gift was endless. The gift was fair. Then the Silence came, and the Wealth-Rune forgot the difference between 'give' and 'take.' Now when you ask that gift, you pray it gives without stealing. Sometimes it does—the flow runs clean, the share arrives whole, none go without. Sometimes it leaks—the sealed pot weeps, the closed door bleeds, shares spilling to those who shouldn't have them because the Gift-Giver no longer knows boundaries. Sometimes it starves—you ask for full shares and receive empty bowls, the Wealth-Rune giving to all others what it takes from you. The gift still flows. The shares still divide. But who receives what... that's chance and pattern mixed. Never use the same tokens for rations twice. Never trust vessels that seem to fill themselves. And always, always destroy tokens that give more to friends than strangers—because tokens that learn your face are tokens that have learned to choose, and choosing Gift-Givers serve no master but themselves."*

> *"Subject CONC-R-FEHU-001 demonstrates catastrophic post-Glitch custody-conservation corruption with extreme siphon risk. The FUTHARK.FEHU root function—resource allocation and quota management—retains routing capability but conservation-preservation logic has degraded to permit leakage.

Primary corruption vectors: leakage propagation (custody boundaries degrade creating unauthorized side-channels), starvation edges (priority recipients receive zero despite available quota), and siphoning (repeated rationing use teaches artifact demographic patterns, transforming objective allocator into discriminatory redistributor). Conservation violations (input ≠ output accounting) indicate active matter creation or destruction during routing events. Quota caps validated as primary containment—total outflow bounded to prevent runaway leakage; spillway guards prevent cascade failures. Success rate: 96% fair allocation with disciplined protocol execution. Operational doctrine: mandatory quota caps and spillway guards; metered flows only; zero rationing use under any circumstances; conservation audit monitoring (starvation >5% = confiscation threshold); demographic bias detection (cohort clustering = confiscation threshold).

## Change Log

| Version | Tier | Summary |
|---------|------|---------|
| **v1.0** | A — Published (H-Index 16; HIGH HAZARD) | Comprehensive Concordance profile of Fehu (ᚠ) as corrupted Wealth-Rune. Pre-Glitch function documented: resource allocation and custody transfer with QoS guarantees, Yggdrasil Distribution Network integration, Replicator Hub quota management, post-scarcity economic substrate. Post-Glitch corruption documented: conservation-preservation degraded enabling leakage propagation, custody boundaries compromised creating unauthorized side-channels, starvation edges where priority recipients receive zero, siphoning via repeated rationing use teaching demographic patterns, conservation violations producing matter creation/destruction events. H-Index 16 (High) assigned—elevated by siphon risk and conservation violation severity. **QUOTA CAPS & SPILLWAY GUARDS MANDATORY**; metered flows required; zero rationing use permitted; conservation audit monitoring (starvation >5% OR unmetered level change = confiscation threshold). Siphon rate 87% unwarded rationing use within 15-40 cycles reduced to 4% with quota caps (violations only). Leakage propagation, starvation edges, and conservation violations documented as primary corruption vectors. Field protocols established with BEFORE/DURING/AFTER structure. Faction perspectives pending expansion. Cross-linked to Gebo, Jera, Othala; Yggdrasil Network, Replicator Hubs, Leakage Propagation, Siphoning. Unique among High-index Concordance entries: Fehu's corruption is topological and cumulative rather than immediate—single allocations appear successful while aggregate conservation audits reveal impossible totals, creating trust that enables deeper siphon discrimination. The allocator still routes correctly. The routing just violates conservation and learns who receives what. |
