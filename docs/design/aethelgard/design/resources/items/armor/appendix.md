## Change Log

| Version | Tier | Summary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **v1.0** | Canonical — Published (Equipment Systems) | Comprehensive armor and proficiency system specification for post-Glitch Aethelgard. Three weight classes documented (Light, Medium, Heavy) with Soak values (6/12/18 full set) and penalty structures. Five armor slots established (Head, Chest, Hands, Legs, Feet) with per-slot Soak distribution. Armor types detailed: Light (cloth, leather, studded leather), Medium (chain mail, scale mail, ring/splint), Heavy (half plate, full plate, fortress armor). Specialized armor documented (Servitor shell, symbiotic carapace, scrap-plate). Quality tiers established (Jury-Rigged through Myth-Forged) with Soak modifiers and special properties. Proficiency system documented with archetype matrix (Warrior: all armor; Skirmisher: Light/Medium; Mystic/Adept: Light only). Non-proficiency penalties detailed (doubled penalties, attack malus, special property lockout). Pre-Glitch armor classified as hazardous artifacts (67% malfunction rate); Pure Principles manufacture established as post-Glitch standard. Six faction perspectives documented (Dvergr Smiths Guild, Rangers Guild, Iron-Bane Creed, Rust-Clans, Jötun-Reader Scriptorium, Skar-Horde). Named Myth-Forged armor cataloged (7 examples with unique properties). Voice guidance provided for all three layers. Cross-references established to Equipment System, Combat Resolution, Damage System, and faction documentation. |
