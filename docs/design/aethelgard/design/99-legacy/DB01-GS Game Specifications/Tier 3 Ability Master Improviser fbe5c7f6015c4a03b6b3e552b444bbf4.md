## Core Identity

**Master Improviser** transforms field crafting from function into art. Your hands move with **unconscious efficiency**, crude materials becoming refined implements. **Traps become wounding mechanisms. Remedies rival workshop medicine.**

---

## Mechanics

### Always Active

Upgrades Tier 1 field crafting abilities automatically:

**Improvised Trap Upgrade:**

- Now applies [Bleeding] (1d4/turn, 3 turns)
- [Rooted] duration: 1 → **2 turns**
- Same cost (15 Stamina + components)

**Basic Concoction Upgrade:**

- [Refined Poultice]: **4d6 HP** (doubled from 2d6)
- [Potent Stimulant]: **30 Stamina** (doubled from 15)
- Same cost (10 Stamina + components)

### Rank Progression

| Rank | PP Cost | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 5 | Base upgrades (trap + concoction) |
| 2 | 35 | Trap bleeding → 2d4/turn |
| 3 | 50 | Poultice → 6d6, Stimulant → 45 Stamina |

---

## Tactical Applications

**Enhanced Trap:**

```
Cost: 15 Stamina + components (unchanged)

═══ ENEMY TRIGGERS ═══
[ROOTED] × 2 turns!
[BLEEDING]: 1d4/turn × 3 turns = ~8 damage total

Cost-Benefit: 15 Stamina for 8 damage + 2 turns control
Exceptional value!
```

**Refined Healing:**

```
Components: 1× Herb + 1× Cloth (same as before)
Cost: 10 Stamina (same as before)
Healing: 4d6 = 16 HP average (DOUBLED!)

Hold 3× pre-combat: 48 HP burst healing available
Budget healer for expeditions!
```

**Synergies:**

- **Improvised Trap:** Core upgrade target
- **Basic Concoction:** Core upgrade target
- **Live off the Land:** Auto-herbs enable frequent crafting

## Failure Modes

<aside>
⚠️

**Prerequisite Dependency** — Requires both Improvised Trap and Basic Concoction to be useful. Without Tier 1 abilities, upgrade has nothing to enhance.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Component Scarcity** — Doubles effectiveness but doesn't create components. Materials at zero = enhanced abilities inaccessible.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Preparation vs Combat** — Upgrades preparation phase, not combat tactics. Enhanced concoctions require pre-combat crafting.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**High-Soak Enemies** — Bleeding enhancement (1d4/turn) negated by high Soak (8+). Against armored foes, trap upgrade provides minimal benefit.
