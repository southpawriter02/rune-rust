# The Atgeir-Wielder — The Formation Master

> *"The world is trying to tear itself apart. The Blight screams with paradox and the Undying charge without reason. But here, at the tip of this haft, is a zone of absolute order. I decide who stands where. I decide when the line breaks. I decide who lives and who dies in the space I command. Rage is for those who cannot think. I think. And I control."*
> — Thane Björn Half-Hand, Siege of the Hollow Gate

The **Atgeir-Wielder** is not a wild berserker or a savage duelist.

They are the **thinking person's warrior**.

In a world defined by the chaotic, glitching horror of the Runic Blight, the Atgeir-Wielder is the Eye of the Storm—a master of tactical positioning who understands that the only way to survive a system crash is to enforce a zone of absolute, undeniable order. Wielding a long polearm (the atgeir), they command the space around them, not with wild rage, but with the cold, irrefutable logic of leverage and discipline.

Their fighting style is a direct refutation of the Blight's chaos. Where the Blight creates unpredictable movement and paradox, the Atgeir-Wielder creates impassable lines and dictates the flow of battle with unerring precision.

To choose the Atgeir-Wielder is to embrace the fantasy of the **disciplined hoplite and the master of formation warfare**. Your saga is written in the shield walls you anchor and the enemy charges you break. You are the immovable object against which the chaos of the broken world shatters—a bastion of pure, martial order.

Every push, every pull, every perfectly braced defense is a statement of your unyielding will.

## Core Philosophy: The Art of Reach and Control

### The Three Pillars

| Pillar | Mechanic | Fantasy |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Superior Reach** | [Reach] keyword | Strike the front line from the safety of the back row |
| **Formation Breaking** | [Push]/[Pull] effects | Shatter enemy positioning; serve up vulnerable targets |
| **Anchor of Logic** | Disciplined Stances | Create zones of immovable order in a chaotic world |

The Atgeir-Wielder's power comes from understanding a fundamental truth: **controlling space is controlling victory**.

> *"The polearm is logic made physical. Every stance, every thrust, every sweep represents centuries of military tradition—the same disciplined formations that protected the ancients now adapted to protect the survivors of the broken world."*

### The Coherent Path

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Coherent (no Corruption, no heretical costs) |
| **Risk Level** | None (safest Warrior specialization) |
| **Power Source** | Tactical discipline, physical leverage, military tradition |
| **Social Function** | Formation anchor, defensive coordinator, tactical commander |

The Atgeir-Wielder is a Coherent Warrior—no rage mechanics, no corruption costs, no heretical bargains. Their power comes entirely from training, discipline, and superior positioning.

Where the Berserkr channels trauma into fury and the Iron-Bane channels faith into vengeance, the Atgeir-Wielder channels **knowledge into control**. WITS as a secondary attribute makes them the tactical, thinking Warrior—the one who wins battles before they begin.

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Disciplined hoplite; the unbreakable anchor of the formation |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Methodical, deliberate, highly strategic frontline controller |
| **Success Metric** | Enemy formations shattered; party protected; line held |
| **Decision Space** | "Where do I position? Who do I push? Who do I pull? When do I brace?" |

Playing an Atgeir-Wielder is about **controlling the combat grid**.

Your gameplay loop:
- **Position**: Start in the back row for safety, leveraging [Reach] to contribute damage
- **Disrupt**: Use Line Breaker to push the enemy front line back, shattering their formation
- **Serve**: Use Hook and Drag to pull priority targets (enemy casters) into your melee's kill zone
- **Anchor**: When necessary, move to the front row, activate Disciplined Stance, and become immovable

You are the master of space—you dictate where the battle happens, who stands where, and when the enemy formation breaks.

> *"Your power is not in burst damage or wild aggression—it's in patient, calculated control. You are the unbreakable foundation upon which victories are built."*

---

## Core Mechanics

### The [Reach] Keyword

| User Position | Normal Melee | With [Reach] |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Front Row | Front Row enemies | Front + Back Row enemies |
| **Back Row** | **Cannot melee** | **Front Row enemies** |

The Atgeir-Wielder's signature mechanic allows attacks across the positioning grid. From the safety of your own **back row**, you can strike enemies in their **front row**—projecting threat without exposing yourself to retaliation.

This is a unique positioning advantage. You contribute frontline damage without taking frontline danger, freeing your tank to absorb attacks while you control and damage from safety.

> *"[Reach] abilities bypass standard melee engagement rules when user is in Back Row."*

### Formation Breaking ([Push] and [Pull])

| Effect | Direction | Opposed Check |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **[Push]** | Front Row → Back Row | MIGHT vs STURDINESS |
| **[Pull]** | Back Row → Front Row | MIGHT vs STURDINESS |

The Atgeir-Wielder is a master of forced movement effects using polearm leverage.

| Mechanic | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| **Hook and Drag** | Pull back-row enemies into front-row danger |
| **Line Breaker** | Push entire enemy front row back into their back row |
| **Combined Strategy** | Push front line back → Pull priority targets from newly exposed back line |

Resolution: Attacker rolls MIGHT dice pool vs target's STURDINESS dice pool. On success, target is forcibly moved. Most effective against low-STURDINESS targets (Mystics, Skirmishers).

> *"The length and leverage of the polearm enables physical manipulation of enemy positioning, disrupting formations and creating tactical openings."*

### Disciplined Stances

| Stance | Effect | Trade-off |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Disciplined Stance** | +4→6 Soak, +3 dice vs [Push]/[Pull] (immune at mastery) | Cannot move while active |
| **Brace for Charge** | +10 Soak vs melee, negate [Knocked Down], counter-damage | Reactive stance |

The Atgeir-Wielder uses specialized defensive stances to anchor formations. These stances trade **mobility for immovability**—when you activate Disciplined Stance, you become an impassable obstacle.

> *"The warrior plants their feet, becoming an anchor of stability. This stance is a declaration of intent: this line will not be broken."*

## Abilities: The Phalanx's Art

### Tier 1 — Foundational Discipline

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Formal Training I** | Passive | — | +5→10 Stamina regen/turn; +1→2 dice to resist [Staggered]/[Disoriented] |
| **Skewer** | Active | 40 Stamina | [Reach] single-target Physical damage; Rank 3 crit applies [Bleeding] |
| **Disciplined Stance** | Active | 30 Stamina | +4→6 Soak, resist [Push]/[Pull], cannot move; 2→3 turns |

**Formal Training I** is the foundational passive. It represents the rigorous, unwavering discipline instilled in every Atgeir-Wielder. Enhanced Stamina regeneration keeps you fighting longer; resistance to disruption effects maintains your tactical clarity.

**Skewer** is your core damage ability—a precise, powerful thrust designed to exploit the weapon's length. The [Reach] property allows you to strike front-row enemies from back-row safety.

> *"The Skewer is not a wild lunge or desperate thrust—it is geometry made lethal. The Atgeir-Wielder has calculated the angles, measured the distance, and executed the motion ten thousand times."*

**Disciplined Stance** is your personal survival tool. Plant your feet and become an anchor of stability. You gain significant Soak and resistance to forced movement—but you cannot move while it's active.

### Tier 2 — Advanced Control

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Hook and Drag** | Active | 45 Stamina | [Pull] back-row enemy to front row; applies [Slowed] for 1 turn |
| **Line Breaker** | Active | 50 Stamina | AoE [Push] all front-row enemies to back row; applies [Off-Balance] |
| **Guarding Presence** | Passive | — | Adjacent allies gain +1→2 Soak; Rank 3 adds +5 Stamina regen to allies |

**Hook and Drag** is your target-acquisition tool. Use the hooked blade of your atgeir to snag a back-row enemy and drag them into the front-row kill zone. The [Slowed] debuff prevents them from retreating.

> *"The hooked blade catches flesh or armor. A brutal yank. The enemy caster who thought they were safe finds themselves face-to-face with your Berserkr."*

**Line Breaker** is your formation-shattering tool. A wide, sweeping push that hits all front-row enemies. Each must make an opposed STURDINESS check or be driven back into their back row—shattering defensive formations and exposing vulnerable targets.

**Guarding Presence** is your formation-anchor aura. Your disciplined presence provides Soak bonuses to adjacent allies. At Rank 3, you also grant Stamina regeneration—your mere proximity makes allies more durable and more enduring.

### Tier 3 — Mastery of Formation

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Brace for Charge** | Active | 40 Stamina | Reactive stance; +10 Soak vs melee, negate [Knocked Down], counter-damage on hit |
| **Unstoppable Phalanx** | Active | 60 Stamina | Line-piercing attack; [Reach], hits all enemies in a line, applies [Off-Balance] |

**Brace for Charge** is your anti-charge stance. When an enemy Elite charges, you absorb the impact with massive Soak, negate the knockdown, and counter-damage the charger. The charge that was meant to break your line instead breaks the charger.

> *"The beast charges. A thousand pounds of corrupted muscle and hate. The Atgeir-Wielder does not flinch. The haft braces. The tip catches. The charge ends."*

**Unstoppable Phalanx** is your line-piercing devastation. A powerful thrust that passes through multiple enemies in a line, applying [Off-Balance] to each. This is the spear-tip of the phalanx—the irresistible thrust that breaks through any formation.

### Capstone — Living Fortress

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Type** | Passive |
| **Cost** | — |
| **Effect (Rank 1)** | Immune to all [Push]/[Pull] effects; automatically enter [Braced] when attacked |
| **Effect (Rank 2)** | +2 Soak aura to all allies in same row |
| **Effect (Rank 3)** | Enemies in melee range suffer [Zone of Control]: -1 to hit, -1 Defense |

The capstone **Living Fortress** represents the moment when training transcends technique and becomes identity. The Atgeir-Wielder who achieves this pinnacle is no longer using a polearm—they ARE a fortress.

> *"They no longer stand on the battlefield—they ARE the battlefield. Their presence alone is a zone of absolute control, a pocket of order in the chaos of combat. Enemies who enter their reach find their movements constrained, their attacks disrupted, their formations crumbling."*

Complete immunity to forced movement. Automatic defensive bracing. An aura of protection for allies. And a Zone of Control that debuffs any enemy who dares approach.

## Systemic Integration

### Positioning Grid Interaction

| Position | Function |
|----------|----------|
| **Back Row** | Safe damage contribution via [Reach]; formation oversight |
| **Front Row** | Immovable anchor via stances; Guarding Presence protection |
| **Transition** | Move forward when front line needs reinforcement |

The Atgeir-Wielder is unique among Warriors in their relationship with the positioning grid. While most melee fighters must be in the front row to contribute, the Atgeir-Wielder can deal damage from the back row—then move forward when needed to anchor the formation.

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Skjaldmær** | Forms unbreakable shield wall; Guarding Presence stacks with tank durability |
| **Berserkr** | Hook and Drag serves up targets for burst damage |
| **Hólmgangr** | Pull duel targets into the duelist's preferred position |
| **Mystics/Adepts** | Protect fragile back-row casters with formation control |
| **Vargr-Born** | [Bleeding] from Skewer Rank 3 feeds Taste for Blood |

> *"The Atgeir-Wielder is the Warrior for players who want a tactical, positioning-focused playstyle. They excel at controlling space, breaking formations, and anchoring their party's defense."*

### Counter-Matchups

| Threat | Response |
|--------|----------|
| **Back-row casters** | Hook and Drag into melee range |
| **Charging beasts** | Brace for Charge counter-damage |
| **Push/Pull controllers** | Living Fortress immunity |
| **Shield wall formations** | Line Breaker shatters positioning |

### Weakness Conditions

| Situation | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| **High-mobility enemies** | Cannot control enemies who ignore positioning |
| **Ranged attackers** | [Reach] doesn't help against enemies who don't need to close |
| **Solo play** | Formation abilities wasted without allies |
| **High-STURDINESS enemies** | Push/Pull effects can be resisted |

## Lore Integration

### Historical Development

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| **Pre-Glitch** | Formal military forces with phalanx tactics |
| **Post-Glitch Crisis** | Survivors who understood formation warfare survived |
| **Age of Echoes** | Formalized Atgeir tradition; discipline as survival doctrine |
| **Modern Practice** | Reach-Discipline—converting distance into order |

The Atgeir tradition evolved from the survivors who understood that chaos could be opposed with geometry. When the Undying charged and the Blight screamed, the warriors who held formation survived. Those who broke and ran died.

### Reach-Discipline

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Haft Geometry** | The mathematics of leverage and reach |
| **Lane Control** | Commanding specific zones of the battlefield |
| **Anchor Ethics** | The moral weight of holding the line |
| **Formation Memory** | Trained reflexes for coordinated movement |

The Layer 2 practitioners describe the Atgeir-Wielder as a practitioner of **reach-discipline**—a craft that converts distance into order. Their treatises record haft geometry, lane control, anchor ethics, and the proper maintenance of the polearm tradition.

> *"Reach-discipline is not mere combat technique. It is the imposition of mathematical order upon chaos. The atgeir is a theorem made steel."*

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Gate-Holds** | Highly valued; formation anchors are essential for gate defense |
| **Jötun-Readers** | Appreciate the logical, systematic approach |
| **Rangers Guild** | Respect the discipline, though prefer mobility |
| **Iron-Banes** | View Atgeir-Wielders as exemplars of proper martial virtue |
| **Rust-Clans** | Mixed—discipline is alien, but results are undeniable |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the songs, they are the unbreakable lines. When the howling chaos of the Blight crashes against them, they do not bend, they do not break, they do not retreat. They plant their hafts in the broken earth and declare with every breath: 'This far. No further.' Their weapons are not just steel and wood—they are the logic of the old world made manifest, the last theorem that the screaming paradox cannot solve. Where others fight with rage or desperation, they fight with geometry, with leverage, with the cold certainty that a well-held line defeats any charge. They are the anchors that hold the shield walls together, the calm eyes at the center of every storm. When the world itself is trying to tear reality apart, they impose order through sheer, unrelenting discipline."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Atgeir-Wielder (Formation Master) represents the Coherent Warrior specialization optimized for tactical control and formation anchoring. Mechanical role: off-tank controller with unique positioning capabilities. Key differentiator: [Reach] property allows back-row damage contribution, unlike any other melee specialization. Core mechanics: [Push]/[Pull] forced movement effects for formation disruption, Disciplined Stances for immovability. Signature ability: Living Fortress capstone (complete forced movement immunity, automatic bracing, Zone of Control debuffs). Trauma Economy interaction: None—safest Warrior specialization. Optimal deployment: coordinated parties requiring formation disruption, encounters with back-row priority targets, defensive scenarios requiring an immovable anchor. Requires tactical awareness and positioning skill; lower solo viability."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Atgeir-Wielder (Formation Master). ARCHETYPE: Warrior. PATH TYPE: Coherent (Zero Trauma Risk). ROLE: Tactical Reach Combatant / Battlefield Controller / Formation Anchor. PRIMARY STAT: MIGHT. SECONDARY STAT: WITS. RESOURCE: Stamina. CORE MECHANICS: [Reach] (back row → front row attacks), [Push] (MIGHT vs STURDINESS, front→back), [Pull] (MIGHT vs STURDINESS, back→front), Disciplined Stances (mobility↔immovability trade). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Discipline): Formal Training I, Skewer, Disciplined Stance. T2 (Advanced Control): Hook and Drag, Line Breaker, Guarding Presence. T3 (Mastery): Brace for Charge, Unstoppable Phalanx. CAPSTONE: Living Fortress (immune to forced movement, auto-Brace, Zone of Control aura). SYNERGIES: Skjaldmær (combined durability), Berserkr (target delivery), Hólmgangr (duel positioning), fragile back-row allies (protection). COUNTERS: High-mobility enemies, ranged attackers, high-STURDINESS targets (resist Push/Pull), solo scenarios."*

## Summary

The Atgeir-Wielder is the **tactical anchor** of Aethelgard.

Where other Warriors fight with rage or faith, the Atgeir-Wielder fights with geometry. Their [Reach] property allows them to contribute damage from the safety of the back row—a unique positioning advantage that no other melee specialization possesses. Their [Push] and [Pull] effects shatter enemy formations, dragging priority targets into kill zones and driving front-liners into disarray.

Their Disciplined Stances trade mobility for immovability. When an Atgeir-Wielder plants their feet, they become an anchor—a fixed point of order in the chaos of combat. Their capstone, Living Fortress, represents the ultimate expression of this philosophy: complete immunity to forced movement, automatic defensive bracing, and a Zone of Control that debuffs any enemy who dares approach.

They are the thinking person's Warrior. WITS as a secondary attribute rewards tactical awareness and positioning skill. Success requires grid awareness, predictive play, target prioritization, and coordination with the party. The Atgeir-Wielder who understands the geometry of the battlefield will control it absolutely.

They are one of the safest specializations in the game—no Corruption, no Psychic Stress costs, no heretical mechanics. Their power comes entirely from training, discipline, and superior positioning.

*The world is trying to tear itself apart.*
*The Blight screams with paradox.*
*But here, at the tip of this haft, is a zone of absolute order.*
*This line will not be broken.*
