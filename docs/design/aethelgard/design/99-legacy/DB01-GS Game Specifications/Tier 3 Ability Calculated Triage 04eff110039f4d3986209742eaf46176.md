## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Calculated Triage is the Jötun-Reader's **primary direct-support tool**—the application of pure, cold logic to the chaos of bodily harm. They don't heal wounds; they **prevent them** through flawless tactical instruction.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Apply [Calculated Defense] defensive buff
- **Secondary:** Regeneration effect + Resolve check bonus
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The analyst whose instructions are better than medicine

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Very High (multi-faceted defensive buff)
- **Single Target:** Powerful but focused
- **Action Cost:** Standard Action investment
- **Duration:** 2 rounds requires timing

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Jötun-Reader possesses no knowledge of healing. But their analytical mind is so powerful that they can instantly assess the battlefield, calculate threat trajectories, and deliver **precise verbal instructions** for optimal defensive positioning.

*"Shift your weight to your back foot. Raise your shield exactly 15 degrees. The next attack will come from your left—pivot when I say NOW."*

The ally's wounds don't heal. They simply stop *taking* wounds.

### Thematic Resonance

Calculated Triage transforms the Jötun-Reader into a combat controller who heals through **prevention, not restoration**—proof that the right instruction is worth a hundred bandages.
