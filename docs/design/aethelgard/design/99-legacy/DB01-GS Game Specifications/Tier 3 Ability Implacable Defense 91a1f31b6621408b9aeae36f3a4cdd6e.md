## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Implacable Defense is the Skjaldmær's **ultimate stability cooldown**—a defensive stance that grants immunity to all control effects, both physical and mental. This ensures she can hold the line under any conditions, never losing position or composure.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Immunity to physical control effects ([Stun], [Staggered], [Knocked Down])
- **Primary:** Immunity to mental control effects ([Fear], [Disoriented])
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The unmovable object—perfect focus against chaos

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Very high (control immunity is extremely valuable)
- **Self-Only:** Does not protect allies
- **Duration Limited:** 3 turns requires tactical timing
- **Damage Trade-off:** Does not reduce incoming damage, only prevents control

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Skjaldmær achieves a state of **perfect focus**. Her breathing slows, her stance roots, and her will becomes a fortress. The glitching reality that seeks to disrupt her finds no purchase. Physical blows that should stagger her are absorbed without flinching. Psychic screams that should terrify her break against her resolve like waves against stone.

### Thematic Resonance

Implacable Defense is the ultimate expression of the "bastion" identity—not just durable, but *unmovable*. In Aethelgard, where control effects can cascade into party wipes, the ability to simply ignore them is invaluable.

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Guardian's Taunt:** Enemies must attack Skjaldmær, but cannot control her
- **Shield Wall:** Combined with control immunity, formation becomes truly unbreakable
- **High-stress encounters:** Ignore mental control while managing other threats
- **Boss mechanics:** Many bosses rely on control effects; this ability negates them

### Negative Synergies

- **Damage-heavy encounters:** Does not help against pure damage
- **Control-light encounters:** Wasted if enemies don't use covered effects
- **Ally protection:** Cannot share immunity with allies
