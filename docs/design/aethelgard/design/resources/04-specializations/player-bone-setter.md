# The Bone-Setter — The Restorer of Coherence

> *"The world wants them dead. The Blight wants them mad. The wastes want them broken. And I want them walking out of here under their own power. One of us is going to be disappointed today, and it's not going to be me."*
> — Field Manual of the Bone-Setter's Guild, Opening Invocation

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Adept |
| **Role** | Non-Magical Healer, Sanity Anchor, Combat Medic |
| **Path Type** | Coherent |
| **Primary Attribute** | WITS |
| **Secondary Attribute** | FINESSE |
| **Resource System** | Stamina |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | None |
| **Unlock Cost** | 10 PP |

The **Bone-Setter** is not a mystic. They do not channel corrupted Aether or bargain with the Blight's entropy.

They are a **pragmatic healer**.

In a world that relentlessly assaults the body and shatters the mind, the Bone-Setter is the calm, steady hand that stitches wounds, sets bones, and anchors the fraying sanity of their comrades. Their power comes not from magic, but from a deep, almost clinical understanding of anatomy, herbalism, and psychological first aid.

Their philosophy is brutally simple: *the body wants to live*. Their job is to give it the chance.

They understand a chilling truth that most healers in other worlds never learn: **the wounds of the soul are as real and as deadly as the wounds of the flesh**. A body cannot truly heal if the mind is screaming. This makes them the indispensable surgeons and therapists of the Age of Echoes—their sagas written not in heroic deeds, but in the quiet, vital moments of mending a world, one broken body and one shattered mind at a time.

To choose the Bone-Setter is to embrace the fantasy of the **indispensable combat medic and the anchor of sanity**. Your saga is not written in the enemies you defeat, but in the lives you save and the minds you keep from breaking. You are the quiet, unassuming hero who ensures the party is coherent enough to continue their own sagas.

## Core Philosophy: Pragmatic Restoration

### The Mender's Oath

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Preparation is Power** | Enter the field with a full kit or don't enter at all |
| **Triage is Doctrine** | Treat the most grievous wounds first—body or mind |
| **First, Do No Harm** | A dead healer saves no one; self-preservation is sacred duty |
| **The Body Wants to Live** | Clear the path; the patient does the rest |

The Bone-Setter's power comes entirely from preparation and knowledge. Unlike mystic healers who channel external forces, the Bone-Setter relies on:
- **Anatomical expertise**: Knowing where to cut, where to stitch, where to apply pressure
- **Alchemical knowledge**: The right poultice for the right wound
- **Psychological training**: The grounding techniques that pull a mind back from the brink

> *"A Bone-Setter's effectiveness is directly proportional to their preparation. The medic who enters the field without a well-stocked kit will find themselves unable to fulfill their role."*

### The Coherent Path

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Coherent (no Corruption, no heretical costs) |
| **Risk Level** | None (safest specialization in the game) |
| **Power Source** | Skill, knowledge, preparation—not Aetheric manipulation |
| **Social Function** | Combat medic, triage officer, sanity anchor, risk enabler |

The Bone-Setter is the **safest specialization** in the entire Trauma Economy. They have no self-inflicted Psychic Stress mechanics, no Corruption costs, no heretical bargains. Their power is entirely skill-based and preparation-dependent.

This makes them the ideal partner for high-risk specializations. Where the Berserkr rages at the edge of sanity, where the Echo-Caller burns through Corruption, where the Galdr-Caster channels forces that strain their mind—the Bone-Setter stands ready to patch them back together.

> *"A good Bone-Setter lets Berserkrs go full rage, lets Echo-Callers push Corruption limits, lets the party take calculated risks. Without a Bone-Setter, those risks become suicide."*

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Indispensable combat medic; the one who keeps everyone alive |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Pure support class focused on resource management and triage |
| **Success Metric** | Party never dies; wounds are healed before they become fatal |
| **Decision Space** | "Who needs healing most? What consumable do I use? When do I save the Miracle Tincture?" |

Playing a Bone-Setter is about **triage, resource management, and keeping a cool head in a crisis**.

Your gameplay loop:
- **Prepare**: During downtime, craft consumables—poultices, antidotes, stabilizing draughts
- **Assess**: In combat, identify who needs healing most urgently
- **Treat**: Apply the right treatment at the right time
- **Protect**: Survive long enough to keep treating

You are a **high-priority target** for enemies. Your ability to reverse the party's attrition is a massive threat. Positioning and self-preservation are critical.

> *"Playing a Bone-Setter is a game of triage, resource management, and keeping a cool head in a crisis."*

## Core Mechanics

### Field Medicine (Crafting)

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Function** | Craft healing consumables during downtime |
| **Scaling** | WITS provides bonus dice; Field Medic passive enhances quality |
| **Products** | Healing Poultices, Antidotes, Calming Draughts, Miracle Tinctures |
| **Philosophy** | Preparation IS your power; enter well-stocked or fail |

The Bone-Setter is the master of the **Field Medicine** non-artisan crafting discipline. During downtime, they transform raw components into the consumables that fuel their abilities.

| Item | Components | Effect | Craft DC |
|------|------------|--------|----------|
| **Healing Poultice** | 2 Common Herb + 1 Clean Cloth | Restore 15 HP (base) | DC 10 |
| **Common Antidote** | 1 Common Herb + 1 Antiseptic | Remove [Poisoned]/[Disease] | DC 12 |
| **Calming Draught** | 2 Common Herb + 1 Antiseptic | Used by Cognitive Realignment | DC 14 |
| **Miracle Tincture** | Rare components | Required for Miracle Worker | DC 18 |

### Triage System

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Physical Triage** | HP restoration, bleeding cessation, poison/disease removal |
| **Psychic Triage** | Stress reduction, fear removal, mental debuff cleansing |
| **Efficiency Scaling** | Triage passive provides +25-50% effectiveness on critical patients |
| **Philosophy** | Treat the most grievous wounds first, whether body or mind |

The Bone-Setter is the only non-heretical specialization capable of **directly combating Psychic Stress**. Through calming poultices, focused breathing techniques, and pragmatic counsel, they can actively reduce an ally's Stress meter.

> *"The Bone-Setter understands a truth most never learn: you cannot heal a body whose mind is screaming."*

### Anatomical Knowledge

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Diagnostic Use** | Identify weaknesses, ailments, and treatment requirements |
| **Offensive Use** | Anatomical Insight applies [Vulnerable] to organic enemies |
| **Restriction** | Does not work on Undying or mechanical constructs |
| **Philosophy** | Knowledge of how to heal is knowledge of how to harm |

The Bone-Setter's anatomical expertise is not limited to healing. They can observe a living creature and instantly recognize its anatomical weaknesses—knowledge that translates directly into combat advantage.

## Abilities: The Mender's Art

### Tier 1 — Foundational Medicine

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Field Medic I** | Passive | — | +1→3 dice to Field Medicine crafting; crafted items gain +5→15 HP restored; start expeditions with 3 extra poultices |
| **Mend Wound** | Active | 35→30 Stamina | Consume [Healing Poultice]; heal 3d6→5d6 HP + WITS bonus |
| **Apply Tourniquet** | Active | 30 Stamina | Remove [Bleeding]; target immune to [Bleeding] for 2→3 turns; Rank 3 prevents bleed-death once per combat |

**Field Medic I** is the foundational passive. It establishes crafting superiority and ensures you always have baseline resources. At Rank 3, you have a 10% chance to not consume materials when crafting.

**Mend Wound** is your core healing ability. It requires consuming a [Healing Poultice] from inventory, creating meaningful resource management. The healing formula scales with both poultice quality AND your WITS attribute.

> *"The Bone-Setter kneels beside the wounded, hands steady despite the chaos. Clean the wound, apply pressure, dress it properly—the fundamentals that separate survival from bleeding out in a ditch."*

**Apply Tourniquet** is your emergency response. It immediately removes [Bleeding]—one of the most dangerous status effects in the game—and provides temporary immunity. At Rank 3, it can prevent death from bleed damage once per combat.

### Tier 2 — Advanced Treatment

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Anatomical Insight** | Active | 40 Stamina | WITS check vs organic enemy; success applies [Vulnerable] for 2→3 turns (+2 damage from all sources) |
| **Administer Antidote** | Active | 30 Stamina | Consume [Common Antidote]; remove [Poisoned] or [Disease] from ally |
| **Triage** | Passive | — | +25→50% healing effectiveness on allies below 25% HP; Rank 3 auto-stabilizes dying allies in your row |

**Anatomical Insight** is your offensive contribution. You observe an enemy's anatomy and identify weak points. Success applies [Vulnerable], making the target take +2 damage from all sources. This doesn't work on Undying or mechanical constructs.

> *"You observe their anatomy and recognize the weak points. There—that's where to strike."*

**Administer Antidote** is your poison/disease response. It requires consuming a [Common Antidote]—another consumable you must prepare in advance.

**Triage** is the passive that defines battlefield medicine: treat the most grievous wounds first. Your healing is dramatically more effective on critically wounded allies. At Rank 3, you automatically stabilize any dying ally in your row.

### Tier 3 — Mastery of Anatomy

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Cognitive Realignment** | Active | 45 Stamina | Consume [Calming Draught]; remove [Feared], [Disoriented], [Stunned], [Confused]; restore 15 Psychic Stress |
| **First, Do No Harm** | Passive | — | After using single-target healing, gain +2 Soak and +2d10 Resolve for rest of round |

**Cognitive Realignment** is your premier sanity-restoring ability. Using calming techniques, pressure points, and alchemical smelling salts, you "reboot" a panicked or disoriented mind. This is critical for Trauma Economy management.

> *"'Breathe with me. Focus on my voice. The screaming isn't real.' The words are calm, authoritative. The Bone-Setter's hands are steady. And somehow, impossibly, the ally's eyes focus."*

**First, Do No Harm** is your survivability passive. When focused on the act of healing, you enter a state of heightened awareness that protects you from becoming a casualty while saving another. A dead healer saves no one.

### Capstone — Miracle Worker

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Cost** | 50 Stamina + [Miracle Tincture] |
| **Frequency** | Once per expedition |
| **Requirement** | Target must be below 50% HP |
| **Effect** | Heal 8d6 HP + remove ALL debuffs (physical and mental) + grant [Death Ward] (3 turns) |
| **[Death Ward]** | If reduced to 0 HP, instead set to 1 HP and consume the ward |

The capstone **Miracle Worker** is the Bone-Setter's defining moment—proof that skill, preparation, and sheer refusal to accept defeat can overcome even the most grievous wounds.

> *"Hands move with desperate precision. A rare tincture—hoarded, irreplaceable—is administered. Splints are set by feel alone. Bleeding is stopped through pressure points and improvised sutures. The Bone-Setter's voice, steady and commanding, refuses to let the patient slip away.*
> 
> *'You don't get to die. Not today. Not on my watch.'*
> 
> *And somehow, impossibly, the ally's eyes focus. They breathe. They live."*

The [Miracle Tincture] requirement is critical. This is a rare, difficult-to-craft consumable. A Bone-Setter cannot spam this ability—its use is a major strategic decision that consumes a valuable, limited resource.

## Systemic Integration

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Physical Restoration** | HP healing, bleed cessation, poison cleansing |
| **Psychic Restoration** | Stress reduction, fear removal, mental debuff cleansing |
| **Reactive Healer** | Unlike Skald (prevents Stress), Bone-Setter actively removes Stress |
| **Complete Management** | Party with both Skald (prevention) + Bone-Setter (treatment) has full coverage |

The Bone-Setter is the **reactive counterpart** to the Skald's proactive prevention. Where the Skald prevents Stress from accumulating, the Bone-Setter removes Stress that has already accumulated.

| Skald | Bone-Setter |
|-------|-------------|
| Prevents [Feared] | Removes [Feared] |
| +dice to Resolve Checks | -Psychic Stress directly |
| Narrative firewall | Cognitive reboot |
| Proactive | Reactive |

A party with both has complete Trauma Economy coverage.

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Berserkr** | Enables full-rage strategies; heals the self-damage, stabilizes the self-stress |
| **Echo-Caller** | Patches Corruption damage; restores Stress burned by projections |
| **Galdr-Caster** | Heals post-chant vulnerability; restores Stress from failed concentration |
| **Blót-Priest** | Restores HP sacrificed for blood magic; manages heretical Stress costs |
| **Skjaldmær** | Forms complete defense triangle: Skjaldmær prevents damage, Bone-Setter heals damage, Skald manages stress |

> *"A good Bone-Setter enables the entire party to take calculated risks. Without one, those risks become suicide."*

### Optimal Conditions

| Situation | Advantage |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Attrition encounters** | Long fights where healing creates sustained value |
| **Bleed/poison enemies** | Apply Tourniquet and Administer Antidote are critical counters |
| **High Psychic Stress** | Cognitive Realignment is essential for Trauma Economy |
| **High-risk party** | Enables Berserkr/Echo-Caller/Blót-Priest strategies |

### Weakness Conditions

| Situation | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| **Burst damage** | If allies die before healing can respond, Bone-Setter is useless |
| **No preparation time** | Enters field without consumables → cannot fulfill role |
| **Mechanical enemies** | Anatomical Insight does not work on Undying or constructs |
| **Item-denial effects** | Enemies that prevent item use shut down most abilities |

---

## Lore Integration

### Historical Development

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| **Pre-Glitch** | Medical personnel with standard training |
| **Post-Glitch Crisis** | Survivors who learned to treat wounds without functioning hospitals |
| **Age of Echoes** | Formalized guild traditions; integration of psychic triage |
| **Modern Practice** | Coherence Medicine—treating body AND mind as unified system |

The Bone-Setter tradition evolved from necessity. When the hospitals failed and the machines broke, the survivors who knew anatomy, herbalism, and crisis intervention became invaluable. Over generations, their practices were refined and formalized.

### The Guild System

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Bone-Setter's Guild** | Loose professional network; shares techniques, training, supplies |
| **Training** | Apprenticeship-based; practical field experience required |
| **Ethics** | Non-factional neutrality; treat anyone who can pay (or can't) |
| **Reputation** | Universally respected; even Iron-Banes protect Bone-Setters |

Bone-Setters are one of the few truly neutral professions in Aethelgard. Their skills are too valuable for any faction to risk alienating them. Even the most violent Rust-Clan raiders will protect a Bone-Setter—they know they'll need one eventually.

### Coherence Medicine

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Holistic Recovery** | Body and mind are unified; neither heals alone |
| **Diagnostic Protocol** | Systematic assessment before treatment |
| **Cognitive Hazard Awareness** | Trained to recognize and treat Psychic Stress |
| **Chain of Custody** | Documentation of treatments, outcomes, supplies |

The Layer 2 practitioners describe the Bone-Setter as the "non-runic clinician" of the Age of Echoes—tasked with restoring physical integrity and cognitive coherence without invoking Galdr. Their practice is called **Coherence Medicine**: the systematic restoration of both body and mind to functional baseline.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the songs, they are the ones who refuse to let death win. When the screaming chaos of the wastes tears bodies apart and shatters minds into fragments, the Bone-Setter kneels in the blood and the dust and says 'No.' Their hands are steady when everything else is falling apart. Their voice is calm when the world is screaming. They carry no runic weapons, invoke no eldritch power. They carry bandages and herbs and an unshakeable conviction that every life is worth fighting for. They are the quiet heroes who never write their own sagas, because they're too busy making sure everyone else survives to tell theirs."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Bone-Setter (Restorer of Coherence) represents the Coherent Adept specialization optimized for non-magical healing and Trauma Economy management. Mechanical role: pure support with consumable-based HP restoration and unique Psychic Stress reduction capabilities. Key differentiator: safest specialization in the game—no self-inflicted Stress, no Corruption, no heretical costs. Core mechanic: Field Medicine crafting (preparation-dependent gameplay loop). Signature ability: Miracle Worker (once per expedition, massive heal + Death Ward, requires rare consumable). Trauma Economy interaction: Reactive healer—complements Skald's proactive prevention for complete coverage. Optimal deployment: attrition encounters, parties with high-risk damage dealers, expeditions with significant Psychic Stress hazards. Requires downtime preparation and consumable management."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Bone-Setter (Restorer of Coherence). ARCHETYPE: Adept. PATH TYPE: Coherent (Zero Trauma Risk). ROLE: Non-Magical Healer / Sanity Anchor / Triage Officer. PRIMARY STAT: WITS. SECONDARY STAT: FINESSE. RESOURCE: Stamina. CORE MECHANICS: Field Medicine Crafting, Consumable-Based Healing, Psychic Triage. TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Medicine): Field Medic I, Mend Wound, Apply Tourniquet. T2 (Advanced Treatment): Anatomical Insight, Administer Antidote, Triage. T3 (Mastery): Cognitive Realignment, First Do No Harm. CAPSTONE: Miracle Worker (50 Stamina + Miracle Tincture, once per expedition, 8d6 heal + remove all debuffs + [Death Ward]). SYNERGIES: High-risk specs (Berserkr, Echo-Caller, Blót-Priest), Skald (prevention + treatment = complete coverage), Skjaldmær (defense triangle). COUNTERS: Burst damage, item-denial effects, mechanical enemies (Anatomical Insight fails), insufficient preparation time."*

## Summary

The Bone-Setter is the **pragmatic anchor** of any expedition.

Where others fight the Great Silence with runes and rage and heretical bargains, the Bone-Setter fights with bandages, herbs, and an unshakeable refusal to let anyone die on their watch. Their power is entirely skill-based—no Corruption, no Psychic Stress costs, no heretical mechanics. They are the safest specialization in the game.

But safety comes with responsibility. A Bone-Setter who enters the field without a well-stocked kit cannot fulfill their role. Preparation during downtime—crafting poultices, antidotes, and draughts—is not optional. It is the foundation of everything they do.

Their unique value is **dual-axis restoration**. They heal bodies with Mend Wound and Miracle Worker. They heal minds with Cognitive Realignment. No other non-heretical specialization can directly reduce Psychic Stress. This makes them essential for any party pushing into high-Stress environments.

They enable risk. A Berserkr with a Bone-Setter behind them can rage without restraint. An Echo-Caller with a Bone-Setter can push Corruption limits. The Bone-Setter's healing creates the safety margin that lets everyone else be heroes.

Their capstone, Miracle Worker, is the ultimate expression of their philosophy: that skill, preparation, and sheer refusal to accept defeat can overcome even the most grievous wounds. It requires a rare consumable—the Miracle Tincture—making its use a major strategic decision. But when you need it, nothing else will do.

*The world wants them dead.*
*The Blight wants them mad.*
*The wastes want them broken.*
*And you want them walking out under their own power.*
*One of you is going to be disappointed today.*
*And it's not going to be you.*
