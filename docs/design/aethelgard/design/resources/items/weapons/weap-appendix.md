Weapon categories detailed: one-handed melee (axes, swords, maces, daggers, spears), two-handed melee (greataxes, greatswords, mauls, polearms, staves), ranged (bows, crossbows, throwing weapons, firearms), shields, arcane implements (wands, orbs). Special properties documented: [Throwable], [Versatile], [Armor Penetration], [Reach], [Brutal Critical], [Sweeping Strike], [Quick Draw], [Reload], [Arcane Focus], [AP Reduction]. Pre-Glitch weapons classified as hazardous artifacts (73% malfunction rate); Pure Principles manufacture established as post-Glitch standard. Six faction perspectives documented (Dvergr Smiths Guild, Rangers Guild, Iron-Bane Creed, Rust-Clans, Jötun-Reader Scriptorium, Skar-Horde). Named Myth-Forged weapons cataloged (9 examples with unique properties). Voice guidance provided for all three layers.
