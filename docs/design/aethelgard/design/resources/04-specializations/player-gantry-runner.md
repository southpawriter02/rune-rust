# The Gantry-Runner — The Ghost in the Glitching Machine

> *"The ground is a trap. Down there, in the mud and the rubble, you're just another target—slow, predictable, earthbound. But up here? On the gantries and the ledges and the flickering platforms? Up here, I'm a ghost. I see everything. I can reach anything. And when I decide to fall on you, you won't see me coming. You'll just feel the impact. The sky is not empty. The sky is my highway."*

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Skirmisher |
| **Role** | Mobility Expert / Vertical Navigator / Environmental Exploiter |
| **Path Type** | Coherent (with optional Heretical elements) |
| **Primary Attribute** | FINESSE |
| **Secondary Attribute** | WITS |
| **Resource System** | Stamina |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | Variable (Low for basic mobility; High for Glitch exploitation) |

The **Gantry-Runner** is the Skirmisher specialization that embodies the philosophy that **the ground is a trap**.[^]

They are acrobatic daredevils and masters of parkour who see the vertical, crumbling ruins of the Old World not as a danger, but as a three-dimensional playground and a tactical highway. Their art is one of unparalleled mobility, turning the environment itself into their greatest weapon and their ultimate defense.

To choose the Gantry-Runner is to embrace the fantasy of the **untouchable acrobat** and the master of "death from above." Your saga is not written on the flat plane of a battlefield, but in the soaring leaps between gantries, the impossible runs along sheer walls, and the devastating, gravity-assisted strikes you deliver to the earthbound foes below.

---

## Core Philosophy: The Master of the Vertical Plane

### The Three-Dimensional Highway

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **The Ground is a Trap** | Earthbound = predictable = dead |
| **Verticality is Freedom** | The Z-axis is the Gantry-Runner's domain |
| **Gravity is a Weapon** | Height converts to kinetic energy; falls become attacks |

In a world where the Runic Blight has made reality itself unstable, the Gantry-Runner sees the world's broken architecture not as hazards, but as **opportunities**.[^] Where others see a crumbling gantry, they see a launch point. Where others see a sheer wall, they see a highway. Where others see a flickering, unstable platform, they see a shortcut.

> *"Every ruin is a puzzle. Every collapsed tower is a ladder. Every chasm is just a question waiting for the right answer—and the answer is always: 'Can I jump it?' The others pick their way through the rubble, one careful step at a time. I'm already on the roof, mapping the next three moves."*

Their philosophy has evolved beyond mere parkour expertise. They are **glitch navigators**, possessing an almost supernatural, intuitive understanding of the world's broken physics. They exploit flickering platforms, momentarily solid walls of static, and pockets of shifting gravity to find paths that defy logical space.

### The Coherent-Heretical Spectrum

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Coherent Core** | Physical skill, acrobatics, parkour mastery |
| **Heretical Edge** | Exploiting reality glitches; interfacing with broken physics |
| **Risk Gradient** | Basic movement = safe; Glitch riding = Psychic Stress |
| **Philosophy** | Find perfect flow in a world that is falling apart |

The Gantry-Runner occupies a unique position on the coherent-heretical spectrum. Their foundational abilities are purely physical—skill, strength, and spatial awareness. But their advanced techniques involve **reading and exploiting the Blight's influence on reality**—a dangerous dance with the world's corrupted code.

> *"The purists in the guild say we should stick to 'honest' parkour—solid surfaces, predictable physics. But they don't understand. The glitches aren't the enemy. The glitches are the shortcut. That flickering platform? It's not broken—it's flexible. That pocket of inverted gravity? It's not a hazard—it's a launch pad. I don't fight the Blight. I surf it."*

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Untouchable acrobat; death from above; master of the third dimension |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Fast-paced, dynamic dance of movement and positioning |
| **Success Metric** | Controlling elevation; delivering gravity-assisted strikes; reaching the unreachable |
| **Decision Space** | When to reposition vs. when to attack; risk of Glitch exploitation |

Playing a Gantry-Runner is about **three-dimensional thinking and positional dominance**.[^]

Your operational loop is:
1. **Scout**: Use WITS to spot environmental opportunities and glitches
2. **Ascend**: Use Gantry Leap, Wall Run, or Ride the Glitch to gain elevation
3. **Dominate**: Activate Height Advantage bonuses from superior position
4. **Strike**: Deliver devastating Death From Above or Eagle's Dive attacks
5. **Flow**: Use Flow State to regenerate Stamina and maintain mobility

> *"My turn starts with one question: where's the high ground? I spot the gantry—three tiles up, two tiles over. Gantry Leap. I'm there. Now I have Height Advantage on everything below me. The Undying that was threatening our healer? It's looking up, confused. I'm looking down, smiling. Death From Above. Problem solved. And I didn't even touch the ground."*

You are the party's **ultimate explorer and flanker**—able to reach areas completely inaccessible to other specializations and set up the powerful [Flanked] condition with ease.

### The Trade-Off

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Unparalleled 3D mobility | Fragile on the ground |
| Height Advantage bonuses | Useless in flat, open rooms |
| Can bypass obstacles and find shortcuts | Fumbles cause catastrophic falls |
| Perfect flanking capability | [Rooted] or immobilization is devastating |
| Access to secret areas | Glitch exploitation costs Psychic Stress |

The Gantry-Runner is a **high-risk, high-reward positional specialist**. When they control the Z-axis, they are an untouchable, high-damage threat. When caught on the ground, rooted, or fighting in flat terrain, they lose much of their power.

> *"The worst thing that can happen to me isn't death—it's being stuck on the ground. A Hlekkr-master's chain around my ankle, dragging me back to earth. A [Rooted] effect pinning me to a flat floor. That's when the Gantry-Runner becomes just another Skirmisher. And that's when I'm in trouble."*

| **Urban Acrobat** | Passive bonus | +1d10 to all Acrobatics checks; reduced Stamina for basic movement |

> *"The standard leap command gets you across a one-tile gap if you're lucky. Gantry Leap gets you across two-tile chasms with confidence. That's the difference between 'maybe I can make it' and 'watch this.'"*[^]

### Pillar 2: High Ground Advantage

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Converts elevation superiority into combat bonuses |
| **Precision Bonus** | +1d10 (Rank 1) to +2d10 (Rank 2) to Accuracy Pool |

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

> *"The high ground is everything. From above, I see the whole battlefield. Enemy movements become predictable. Cover positions become irrelevant. System errors become obvious. My shots hit harder, my crits come more often, and every target below me is just waiting to be picked off."*[^]

### Pillar 3: Death From Above

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Gravity-powered melee strike from elevated position |
| **Requirement** | Must be at higher Z-level than target |
| **Damage** | Massive Physical damage |

**Death From Above** is the signature offensive ability—the devastating payoff for achieving superior positioning.[^]

| Ability | Cost | Requirement | Effect |
|---------|------|-------------|--------|
| **Death From Above** | 40 Stamina (T1) / 60 Stamina (T3) | 1+ Z-level above target | High Physical damage + [Armor Piercing] |
| **Eagle's Dive** | 60 Stamina | 2+ Z-levels above target | Massive Physical damage + [Knocked Down] + free repositioning |

> *"Gravity is free damage. Every foot I fall is energy I'm converting into kinetic force. By the time I hit the target, I'm not just a person with a weapon—I'm a kinetic strike, an armor-piercing round made of flesh and steel and perfectly calculated trajectory. And then I roll out and I'm gone before they know what hit them."*

For a moment, I de-compile my own physical code, stepping outside the world's grid entirely. Then I re-compile somewhere else—anywhere I can see, regardless of distance or obstacles. It tears at my sanity. It stains my soul with a whisper of Corruption. But in that moment, I am truly a ghost in the machine."*

## Systemic Integration

### Master of the Labyrinth

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Primary Function** | 3D navigation; vertical combat; exploration specialist |
| **Power Source** | Physical skill + environmental exploitation |
| **Unique Contribution** | Only specialization that fully masters the Z-axis |

The Gantry-Runner is the **undisputed master of the 3D Textual Labyrinth**.[^] They are the key to the party's ability to explore the most treacherous, vertical biomes like Jötunheim and Alfheim. They can bypass obstacles, find shortcuts, and reach hidden areas completely inaccessible to other specializations.

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Coherent core with optional Heretical elements |
| **Corruption Sources** | Ghost in the Machine (capstone) |
| **Psychic Stress Sources** | Fumbles on high-stakes leaps; Ride the Glitch; Ghost in the Machine |
| **Risk Profile** | Gradient from low (basic mobility) to high (glitch exploitation) |

The Gantry-Runner's relationship with the Trauma Economy is **gradient-based**:
- Basic acrobatics (Gantry Leap, Wall Run, Height Advantage) = **Coherent, low risk**
- Glitch exploitation (Ride the Glitch) = **Heretical edge, moderate Psychic Stress**
- Reality de-compilation (Ghost in the Machine) = **Fully Heretical, high Stress + Corruption**

> *"The old-school Gantry-Runners stick to solid surfaces. Safe. Predictable. Limited. The new school rides the glitches, pays the price in sanity, and goes places the purists can't imagine. Choose your poison."*

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Tanks (Skjaldmær, etc.)** | Hold ground-level aggro while Gantry-Runner strikes from above |
| **Jötun-Reader** | Identifies structural weaknesses and safe traversal points |
| **Ranged DPS** | Gantry-Runner achieves elevated positions for superior firing lanes |
| **Controllers** | Lock down ground enemies for easy Death From Above targeting |
| **Healers** | Gantry-Runner can reach isolated allies others can't |

The Gantry-Runner is the **ultimate flanker**. Their Wall Run ability makes them the most reliable character for setting up the powerful [Flanked] condition.

**Counter-Matchups:**

| Threat | Issue |
|--------|-------|
| **[Rooted] / Immobilization** | Devastating; grounds the Gantry-Runner |
| **[Pull] abilities** | Yanks them from elevated positions |
| **Flat, open rooms** | No verticality = no Height Advantage |
| **Flying enemies** | Negate Height Advantage; can pursue to elevated positions |
| **Anti-acrobatics effects** | Anything that penalizes climbing/leaping |

### The KRCS Synergy

| System | Interaction |
|--------|-------------|
| **Kinetic Resonance Combat System** | Flow State makes Gantry-Runner a master of KRCS |
| **Movement Economy** | Constantly moving = constantly regenerating resources |
| **Playstyle** | Never stop; flow from position to position to attack |

## Lore Integration

### The Philosophy of the Vertical

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Heritage** | Urban survivors who learned to navigate the ruins' third dimension |
| **Philosophy** | The ground is a trap; the sky is freedom |
| **Method** | Parkour, structural analysis, glitch navigation |
| **Status** | Valued explorers and scouts; essential for vertical biomes |

The Gantry-Runners emerged from the survivors who realized that the Old World's ruins were not just dangerous—they were **three-dimensional puzzles waiting to be solved**. While others huddled on the ground, the Gantry-Runners learned to see the collapsed towers, the dangling gantries, and the precarious platforms as a highway system.

> *"The first Gantry-Runners were desperate. The ground was full of Draugr, and the only escape was up. They climbed, they leaped, they learned. And they discovered something the ground-bound never realized: from up high, you see everything. You control everything. The ground is where prey lives. The sky is where predators hunt."*

### The Glitch Navigator Evolution

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Traditional Parkour** | Pure physical skill; solid surfaces only |
| **Glitch Navigation** | Reading and exploiting reality instabilities |
| **Philosophical Split** | Purists vs. Progressives |
| **Trade-Off** | Safety vs. Capability |

The modern Gantry-Runner tradition has split into two schools:
- **Purists** stick to "honest" parkour—solid surfaces, predictable physics, coherent power
- **Progressives** embrace glitch navigation—flickering platforms, reality warps, heretical shortcuts

> *"The purists say I'm corrupting the art. That true mastery means trusting only solid stone and honest steel. But I've seen what the progressives can do. They go places the purists can't reach. They solve puzzles the purists can't solve. Yes, it costs them—sanity, sometimes a piece of their soul. But in this world, capability is survival."*

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Exploration Guilds** | Essential; "They find paths others can't see" |
| **Jötun-Readers** | Clinical interest; "Fascinating exploitation of spatial anomalies" |
| **Iron-Banes** | Tactical appreciation; "Excellent scouts for Undying nests" |
| **Mystics** | Wary respect; "They dance with the Blight without channeling it" |
| **General Population** | Awe and envy; "They make the impossible look easy" |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the Age of Echoes, when the Great Glitch shattered the towers of the Old World and left reality itself unstable, the Gantry-Runners emerged as masters of the vertical plane. They are acrobatic daredevils who see the crumbling ruins not as danger, but as a three-dimensional highway—their art is one of unparalleled mobility. They embody the philosophy that the ground is a trap, and that true freedom lies in controlling the Z-axis. With superhuman agility, they leap across chasms that would swallow lesser travelers, run along walls that defy gravity, and plummet from great heights to deliver devastating, armor-piercing strikes to the earthbound foes below. The most advanced among them have learned to read and exploit the world's reality glitches—flickering platforms, pockets of inverted gravity, walls of momentarily solid static—using the Blight's corruption as a shortcut through impossible space. At the height of their mastery, they can briefly de-compile their own physical code, becoming ghosts in the machine who teleport across the battlefield regardless of distance or obstacle. Their saga is a breathtaking dance on the edge of a system crash, a story of finding perfect flow in a world that is falling apart."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Gantry-Runner (Vertical Navigator) represents the Skirmisher specialization optimized for three-dimensional mobility and positional combat. Mechanical role: mobility expert with vertical dominance and "death from above" offense. Core mechanics: Acrobatic Movement (enhanced traversal abilities—Gantry Leap, Wall Run—with lower costs and DCs), High Ground Advantage (accuracy and critical bonuses when at higher elevation), and Death From Above (gravity-powered strikes with Armor Piercing). Key differentiator: only specialization that fully masters the Z-axis; essential for vertical biome exploration; premier flanking capability. Signature ability: Ghost in the Machine (once per combat teleport to any visible tile; costs Stamina, Psychic Stress, and Corruption). Trauma Economy integration: Gradient; coherent core abilities (physical skill) with optional heretical elements (glitch exploitation). Social function: valued explorers and scouts; essential party member for Jötunheim and other vertical environments. Optimal deployment: vertical terrain; flanking-dependent parties; exploration-heavy expeditions; players who enjoy high-mobility, high-skill-ceiling positioning gameplay."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Gantry-Runner (Vertical Navigator). ARCHETYPE: Skirmisher. PATH TYPE: Coherent (with Heretical options). ROLE: Mobility Expert / Vertical Navigator / Environmental Exploiter. PRIMARY STAT: FINESSE. SECONDARY STAT: WITS. RESOURCE: Stamina. CORE MECHANICS: Acrobatic Movement (enhanced traversal; lower DC/cost), High Ground Advantage (elevation → combat bonuses), Death From Above (gravity-powered Armor Piercing strikes), Glitch Navigation (optional; exploit reality instabilities for impossible traversal). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Mobility): Urban Acrobat I (passive, +1d10 Acrobatics, reduced movement Stamina), Gantry Leap (30 Stamina, superior horizontal leap, 2-tile at R3), Glitch Spotter (passive, detect environmental glitches). T2 (Advanced Parkour): Height Advantage (passive, +1-2d10 Accuracy + 10% crit vs lower targets; R3 crits apply [Staggered]), Wall Run (45 Stamina, lateral wall traversal, can use glitched walls; R3 grants [Poised]), Ride the Glitch (30 Stamina + Stress, use glitch for impossible traversal). T3 (Mastery of Flow): Flow State (passive, regenerate Stamina on unique movement ability use), Eagle's Dive (60 Stamina, requires 2+ Z-levels above, massive Physical damage + [Knocked Down] + free reposition). CAPSTONE: Ghost in the Machine (75 Stamina + significant Stress + small Corruption, once per combat, teleport to any visible tile regardless of distance/obstacles). TRAUMA ECONOMY: Gradient risk; basic mobility = coherent/low; glitch exploitation = heretical/moderate-high."*

## Summary

The Gantry-Runner is the **ghost in the glitching machine**.

They are Skirmishers who have mastered the third dimension, turning the vertical ruins of the Old World into their personal highway. Their philosophy is simple and absolute: the ground is a trap; the sky is freedom.

Their gameplay is a **fast-paced dance of positioning and exploitation**. They use Gantry Leap and Wall Run to gain elevation, activate Height Advantage for combat bonuses, and deliver devastating Death From Above strikes to earthbound foes.

Their unique mechanic is **environmental mastery**. They can detect and exploit reality glitches for impossible traversal, and at the capstone, briefly de-compile their own code to teleport anywhere on the battlefield.

The Gantry-Runner operates on a **coherent-heretical gradient**. Basic mobility is purely physical and safe. Glitch exploitation costs Psychic Stress. The capstone Ghost in the Machine is fully heretical, granting godlike repositioning at the cost of sanity and Corruption.

This is the fantasy of the **untouchable acrobat**—not standing and fighting, but soaring, leaping, plummeting, and striking from angles the enemy never expected.

*"The ground is a trap."*
*"The sky is my highway."*
*"Death comes from above."*
