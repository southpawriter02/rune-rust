# The Jötun-Reader — The System Analyst

> *"You see chaos. I see data. Every screaming rune, every glitching automaton, every paradox-scarred wall tells a story. The world did not break randomly—it broke according to a pattern, a catastrophic compiler error cascading through an operating system we've barely begun to understand. I don't repair the broken world. I read its autopsy report. And in that reading, I find the truth that others need to survive."*
> — Archivist Solveig, Grey Scriptorium

The **Jötun-Reader** is not a lore-keeper or a mystic.

They are a **forensic pathologist of the apocalypse**.

In a world running on broken source code, the Jötun-Reader is a system analyst and debugger. They possess the hyper-logical mind necessary to confront the Runic Blight's paradoxes head-on—not to fix them, but to **document** them. They delve into the ruins not for treasure, but to read the world's error logs, seeking to understand the catastrophic compiler error that caused the Great Silence.

Their philosophy is clinical: **observe, document, diagnose**. Where others see screaming chaos, the Jötun-Reader sees patterns. They translate error messages carved in ancient stone, identify structural flaws in corrupted war-machines, and speak fragments of command-line code that freeze enemies in logic conflicts.

To choose the Jötun-Reader is to embrace the fantasy of the **scholar-pathologist who turns knowledge into tactical advantage**. Your saga is written not in enemies slain, but in weaknesses exposed, inscriptions translated, and party members kept alive by the intelligence you provide. You deal zero direct damage—but you increase your party's effectiveness by 30-40%.

The price? **Every truth you uncover costs sanity.**

## Core Philosophy: The Art of Diagnosis

### The Three Pillars

| Pillar | Mechanic | Fantasy |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Information Warfare** | Analyze Weakness, Exploit Design Flaw | Expose enemy defenses; make allies more effective |
| **Linguistic Archaeology** | Runic Linguistics, Navigational Bypass | Translate ancient inscriptions; decipher error codes |
| **Force Multiplication** | Calculated Triage, party-wide buffs | Zero damage, maximum tactical value |

The Jötun-Reader's power comes from understanding a fundamental truth: **the world broke according to a pattern**. The Ginnungagap Glitch was not random chaos—it was a catastrophic compiler error with consistent, documentable failure modes.

> *"The Jötun-Reader observes and documents system failures with clinical precision. They analyze enemy weaknesses, translate runic inscriptions, apply tactical debuffs, and weaponize forbidden knowledge."*

### The Coherent Path (High Risk)

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Coherent (no Corruption mechanics) |
| **Risk Level** | High (Psychic Stress costs for most abilities) |
| **Power Source** | Pure observation and analysis—no Aetheric manipulation |
| **Trade-off** | Knowledge costs sanity; requires Bone-Setter support |

The Jötun-Reader is a **Coherent specialization with High Trauma Risk**—a rare combination. They don't channel corrupted Aether or make heretical bargains. Their power comes entirely from knowledge. But that knowledge has a price: most of their abilities inflict **Psychic Stress** on the caster.

Reading the crash logs of a dead civilization means exposing your mind to the paradoxes that killed it.

> *"Every ability that reveals corrupted knowledge costs sanity. High Trauma Risk creates dependency on Bone-Setter support."*

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Scholar-pathologist; the one who sees what others can't |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Non-combat specialist focused on intelligence and force multiplication |
| **Success Metric** | Allies hit harder, enemies revealed, secrets translated |
| **Decision Space** | "Is this knowledge worth the Stress? Can my Bone-Setter cover me?" |

Playing a Jötun-Reader is about **information warfare and tactical enablement**.

Your gameplay loop:
- **Analyze**: Use Analyze Weakness to reveal enemy stats, resistances, and vulnerabilities
- **Exploit**: Use Exploit Design Flaw to apply [Analyzed] debuff, increasing party accuracy
- **Translate**: Use Runic Linguistics to unlock exploration content and decipher puzzles
- **Guide**: Use Calculated Triage to amplify your healer's effectiveness

You deal **zero direct damage**. Your success is measured entirely by how much more effective you make your allies and how much intelligence you provide.

> *"The Jötun-Reader excels in exploration and problem-solving phases, where their unique abilities unlock 20-30% of dungeon secrets."*

---

## Core Mechanics

### Information Warfare System

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Analyze Weakness** | Reveal enemy resistances, vulnerabilities, AI behavior hints |
| **Exploit Design Flaw** | Apply [Analyzed] status: party gains +2-4 Accuracy, +1d10 damage |
| **The Unspoken Truth** | Psychological attack: apply [Disoriented], [Shaken], Psychic Stress to enemy |

The Jötun-Reader's combat role is **tactical debuffing and party enablement**. You don't damage enemies—you expose their weaknesses so your allies can damage them more effectively.

| Status | Effect | Duration |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **[Analyzed]** | All party attacks gain +2-4 Accuracy, +1d10 bonus damage | 2-4 rounds |
| **[Disoriented]** | Target suffers accuracy penalty, reduced effectiveness | 2-3 rounds |
| **[Shaken]** | Target suffers morale penalty, may flee | 2 rounds |

### Psychic Stress as Resource

| Ability | Stamina Cost | Stress Cost |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Analyze Weakness** | 30 | 5-10 |
| **The Unspoken Truth** | 40 | 0 (inflicts on enemy) |
| **Architect of the Silence** | 60 | 10-15 |

Most Jötun-Reader abilities cost **Psychic Stress** in addition to Stamina. This creates a unique resource management challenge: every piece of intelligence you gather brings you closer to your own psychological breaking point.

> *"Reading the crash logs of a dead civilization means exposing your mind to the paradoxes that killed it."*

### Runic Linguistics System

| Rank | Capability |
|------|------------|
| **Rank 1** | Translate basic non-magical runic inscriptions |
| **Rank 2** | Translate complex inscriptions; identify corrupted runes |
| **Rank 3** | Detect hidden messages; translation at -25% time |

The Jötun-Reader can read and translate runic inscriptions that other characters cannot. This unlocks **20-30% of dungeon content**—hidden passages, puzzle solutions, lore fragments, and tactical information.

**Critical distinction**: Jötun-Readers **translate** command syntax—they do not **execute** it. They are pathologists, not engineers. They read error logs; they do not repair systems.

## Abilities: The Diagnostician's Art

### Tier 1 — Foundational Analysis

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Scholarly Acumen I** | Passive | — | +2→4 dice to WITS-based Investigate and System Bypass checks |
| **Analyze Weakness** | Active | 30 Stamina + 5 Stress | WITS check; reveal 1-all Resistances/Vulnerabilities; Rank 3 auto-crits |
| **Runic Linguistics** | Passive | — | Translate non-magical runic inscriptions; unlock exploration content |

**Scholarly Acumen I** is your foundational passive. Your mind is a finely honed instrument, constantly processing layers of forgotten history. Bonus dice to investigation and system bypass make you the party's premier problem-solver.

**Analyze Weakness** is your core intelligence-gathering ability. Make a WITS check against a target to reveal their resistances, vulnerabilities, and (on critical success) AI behavior hints. The Stress cost represents the mental toll of parsing corrupted data.

> *"Clinical observation reveals structural flaws. You document weakness like a pathologist identifies cause of death."*

**Runic Linguistics** is your exploration enabler. You can read and translate runic inscriptions that others cannot—unlocking puzzle solutions, hidden passages, and critical lore.

### Tier 2 — Advanced Tactical Support

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Exploit Design Flaw** | Active | 25-35 Stamina | Apply [Analyzed]: party gains +2→4 Accuracy, +1d10 damage for 2→4 rounds |
| **Navigational Bypass** | Active | 20-30 Stamina | Party gains +2→3 dice to next 1-2 bypass checks; Rank 3 usable in combat |
| **Structural Insight** | Passive | — | Detect environmental hazards, cover positions, ambush points; Rank 3 grants ambush immunity |

**Exploit Design Flaw** is your party-enablement ability. Having analyzed the enemy, you call out weak points and structural vulnerabilities. All party attacks against the target gain significant accuracy and damage bonuses.

> *"'The joint between torso and arm—stress fractures from the Glitch. Hit there.' Your allies strike with surgical precision."*

**Navigational Bypass** lets you guide the party past traps and hazards. Your knowledge of pre-Glitch architecture reveals safe passages and structural weaknesses.

**Structural Insight** is your environmental awareness passive. You read structural integrity like others read expressions—identifying hazards, optimal cover positions, and potential ambush points.

### Tier 3 — Mastery of Knowledge

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Calculated Triage** | Passive | — | Allies you guide receive +25→75% healing effectiveness |
| **The Unspoken Truth** | Active | 40 Stamina | Opposed WITS vs WILL; success: [Disoriented] 3 rounds + 5-12 Psychic Stress to enemy |

**Calculated Triage** is your healer-amplification passive. Your clinical guidance optimizes treatment—you don't heal, but you make healers dramatically more effective.

> *"'Apply pressure to the brachial artery first. Follow the wound track with the applicator.' Your clinical guidance optimizes treatment."*

**The Unspoken Truth** is your psychological weapon. You speak forbidden lore directly at an intelligent enemy—truths their fractured programming cannot process. This inflicts [Disoriented], [Shaken], and Psychic Stress on the target.

> *"You tell the Undying what it used to be. The name of the person whose corpse it wears. The paradox of its existence. It cannot process the truth."*

### Capstone — Architect of the Silence

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Cost** | 60 Stamina + 10-15 Psychic Stress |
| **Frequency** | Once per combat |
| **Valid Targets** | Jötun-Forged or Undying enemies ONLY |
| **Active Effect** | Target makes high-DC WILL check. Fail: [Seized] 2 rounds. Pass: [Disoriented] 1 round. <50% HP: Auto-[Seized] (daily lockout) |
| **Passive Effect** | Auto-Critical analyze ALL Jötun-Forged/Undying enemies at combat start |

The capstone **Architect of the Silence** represents the moment when the Jötun-Reader transcends mere observation. You no longer just read the corrupted code—you can temporarily **rewrite** it.

> *"'PRIORITY OVERRIDE: TIWAZ PROTOCOL ALPHA. CEASE HOSTILE OPERATIONS.' You speak command-line code in the language of the Great Silence. The machine's logic wars with corrupted directives. You are the Architect—you built this system, and you can shut it down."*

Against Jötun-Forged or Undying enemies, you speak a string of original, uncorrupted command-line code. This temporarily overwrites the Blight's influence, applying [Seized]—complete paralysis—for 2 rounds.

The passive component means you automatically analyze ALL machine-type enemies at combat start with no action or Stress cost. Against the Undying and Jötun-Forged, you are the ultimate specialist.

## Systemic Integration

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Mechanic | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Psychic Stress Costs** | Most abilities inflict 5-15 Stress on caster |
| **High Accumulation** | Aggressive use rapidly builds toward Trauma threshold |
| **Bone-Setter Dependency** | Requires Cognitive Realignment support for sustainability |
| **Knowledge Trade-off** | Every truth revealed costs sanity |

The Jötun-Reader is a **high-risk Adept**. Their Coherent path means no Corruption, but the Psychic Stress costs create significant Trauma Economy pressure. Without Bone-Setter support, aggressive Jötun-Reader play leads to rapid psychological breakdown.

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Bone-Setter** | Essential—Cognitive Realignment manages Stress accumulation |
| **Damage Dealers** | Analyze Weakness + Exploit Design Flaw dramatically increase damage output |
| **Thul** | Jötun-Reader identifies enemy; Thul exploits the information with rhetoric attacks |
| **Skald** | Stress prevention reduces Jötun-Reader's Trauma Economy pressure |
| **Skjaldmær** | Protects fragile analyst from physical threats |

> *"The Jötun-Reader is a non-combat specialist who enables party success through pure knowledge. They deal zero direct damage but increase party effectiveness by 30-40%."*

### Optimal Conditions

| Situation | Advantage |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Exploration-heavy dungeons** | Runic Linguistics unlocks 20-30% of content |
| **Machine enemies** | Architect of the Silence is devastating |
| **Coordinated parties** | Force multiplication rewards teamwork |
| **Puzzle-heavy encounters** | Scholarly Acumen + Runic Linguistics solve what others cannot |

### Weakness Conditions

| Situation | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| **Solo play** | Zero damage output; no self-healing |
| **No Bone-Setter** | Stress accumulation becomes unsustainable |
| **Short combats** | Analysis overhead not worth investment |
| **Non-machine enemies** | Capstone is useless; reduced value |

## Lore Integration

### Historical Development

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| **Pre-Glitch** | Scholars and archivists with academic training |
| **Post-Glitch Crisis** | Survivors who could parse error patterns survived |
| **Age of Echoes** | Formalized diagnostic discipline; Grey Scriptorium founded |
| **Modern Practice** | System analysts embedded in expeditions as intelligence specialists |

The Jötun-Reader tradition evolved from the scholars who discovered that the Glitch followed patterns. While others fled or fought, these early analysts observed and documented. Their records became the foundation of understanding the Runic Blight.

### Diagnostic Methodology

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Observe, Don't Interfere** | Document symptoms; do not attempt repair |
| **Triangulate Sources** | Cross-reference multiple data points |
| **Ledgerize Findings** | Standardized case names and drift descriptors |
| **Accept Uncertainty** | Some questions have no answers |

The Layer 2 practitioners describe the Jötun-Reader as an "archaeologist of a crashed reality." Their methodology emphasizes documentation over intervention, diagnosis over treatment. They are pathologists—they determine cause of death, not resurrection.

> *"Canonical Jötun-Reader Capabilities: Read and translate runic inscriptions. Identify design flaws and vulnerabilities. Document symptoms and failure modes. Provide tactical intelligence to party. They do NOT execute runic commands, repair systems, or 'fix' anything."*

### Factional Relationship

| Entity | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| **Jötun-Reader Creed** | Natural alignment; many Creed members have this specialization |
| **Non-Creed Practitioners** | Possible—the specialization can be learned without joining the Creed |
| **Other Factions** | Respected for intelligence value; sometimes viewed with suspicion |

**Important distinction**: The Jötun-Reader *specialization* is a character build/class. The Jötun-Reader *Creed* is a faction. You can have the specialization without being a Creed member—though they're often aligned.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the songs, they are the Grey Scribes—the quiet, stooped figures who haunt the ruins not for treasure, but for truth. Where others see screaming chaos, they see patterns. Where others flee from the paradox, they lean closer, squinting at the error messages carved in stone. They are the keepers of the old world's ghosts, reading the death throes of a civilization in every corrupted rune and glitching automaton. Their minds are their weapons—and their curse. Every truth they uncover brings them closer to the madness they study. They do not repair the broken world; they document its autopsy, one painful revelation at a time. And in that documentation, they find the knowledge that keeps others alive."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Jötun-Reader (System Analyst) represents the Coherent Adept specialization optimized for information warfare and tactical enablement. Mechanical role: non-combat specialist with zero direct damage but 30-40% party effectiveness increase. Key differentiator: Psychic Stress as resource cost creates unique risk/reward dynamic. Core mechanics: Analyze Weakness (enemy intelligence), Exploit Design Flaw ([Analyzed] debuff), Runic Linguistics (exploration unlock), Calculated Triage (healer amplification). Signature ability: Architect of the Silence capstone ([Seized] on Jötun-Forged/Undying). Trauma Economy interaction: High risk—most abilities cost Psychic Stress, creating Bone-Setter dependency. Optimal deployment: exploration-heavy scenarios, machine-enemy encounters, coordinated parties requiring intelligence support. Weak in solo play and short combats."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Jötun-Reader (System Analyst). ARCHETYPE: Adept. PATH TYPE: Coherent (High Trauma Risk). ROLE: Controller / Utility Specialist / Force Multiplier. PRIMARY STAT: WITS. SECONDARY STAT: FINESSE. RESOURCE: Stamina + Psychic Stress. CORE MECHANICS: Information Warfare (enemy analysis, tactical debuffs), Runic Linguistics (inscription translation, exploration unlock), Force Multiplication (party accuracy/damage buffs, healer amplification). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Analysis): Scholarly Acumen I, Analyze Weakness, Runic Linguistics. T2 (Advanced Support): Exploit Design Flaw, Navigational Bypass, Structural Insight. T3 (Mastery): Calculated Triage, The Unspoken Truth. CAPSTONE: Architect of the Silence (60 Stamina + 10-15 Stress, once per combat, [Seized] on Jötun-Forged/Undying, auto-analyze machines at combat start). SYNERGIES: Bone-Setter (essential Stress management), damage dealers (Analyze+Exploit amplification), Thul (intelligence exploitation). COUNTERS: Solo play, no healer support, short combats, non-machine enemies."*

---

## Summary

The Jötun-Reader is the **forensic pathologist** of Aethelgard.

Where others fight the Blight with weapons and magic, the Jötun-Reader fights with knowledge. They analyze enemies to reveal weaknesses, translate runic inscriptions to unlock secrets, and guide allies with tactical precision that turns fights in the party's favor.

They deal **zero direct damage**. Their success is measured entirely by how much more effective they make their allies—and by the intelligence they provide, increasing party effectiveness by 30-40%.

But knowledge has a cost. Most Jötun-Reader abilities inflict **Psychic Stress** on the caster. Reading the crash logs of a dead civilization means exposing your mind to the paradoxes that killed it. Without Bone-Setter support, aggressive Jötun-Reader play leads to rapid psychological breakdown.

Their capstone, Architect of the Silence, is the ultimate expression of their art: speaking command-line code that temporarily overwrites corrupted machine-logic, seizing control of Jötun-Forged and Undying enemies. Against machines, they are the ultimate specialist.

They are not engineers—they do not repair. They are not mystics—they do not channel. They are **diagnosticians**. They determine cause of death. They document the autopsy of a broken world. And in that documentation, they find the truth that keeps others alive.

*You see chaos.*
*I see data.*
*The world broke according to a pattern.*
*And I am learning to read it.*
