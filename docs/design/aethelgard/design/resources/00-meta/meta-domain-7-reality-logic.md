# Domain 7 — Reality/Logic Rules: The Broken Operating System

> *"The Blight is not a curse. It is not a demon. It is a compiler error in the source code of reality itself—a single, perfect, infinitely repeating logical fallacy broadcast on a frequency that every thinking mind is tuned to receive. You cannot fight it. You cannot cure it. You can only learn to exist within its noise, and pray your mind holds together long enough to matter."*

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain Classification** | Setting Fundamentals Domain 7 of 9 |
| **Document ID** | AAM-META-SETTING-FUNDAMENTALS-v1.0 (Section 7) |
| **Function** | Canonical reality mechanics, paradox governance, Blight/CPS systems |
| **Layer Applicability** | All Layers (L1, L2, L3, L4) |
| **Status** | Canonical — Critical for trauma economy, environmental hazards, status effects |
| **Validation Requirement** | Mandatory for Blight mechanics, CPS references, paradox exposure |

Domain 7 defines **how reality itself is broken** in Aethelgard.

The answer is not "magic corruption" or "demonic influence." The Runic Blight is a **computational failure**—an infinitely recursive paradox woven into the fabric of the Aetheric substrate, forcing every thinking mind to process unresolvable contradictions.

This domain governs the fundamental physics of the post-Glitch world.

## The Aetheric Substrate

### What the Aether Is

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Definition** | Unified quantum energy field |
| **Function** | Planet's operating system; reality's underlying code |
| **Pre-Glitch State** | Clean, deterministic, logical |
| **Post-Glitch State** | Corrupted, paradoxical, hostile |

The Aether is not magic. It is **infrastructure**.

Before the Ginnungagap Glitch, the Aether functioned as a perfect computational substrate—a unified energy field through which the FUTHARK system processed commands with Newtonian precision. Runes were syntax; the Aether was the processor; reality was the output.

> *"Each rune, in the Age of Forging, was a perfect, contained function operating with Newtonian simplicity."*

### Post-Glitch Reality

The Ginnungagap Glitch corrupted the Aether at its most fundamental level. The YGGDRASIL network core failure propagated a recursive logic error through the Aetheric Distribution Network in 23 minutes, transforming the clean computational substrate into a **permanently paradoxical medium**.

| Aspect | Pre-Glitch | Post-Glitch |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Signal Quality** | Clean, deterministic | Corrupted, paradoxical |
| **Runic Execution** | Predictable | Probabilistic |
| **Physical Laws** | Stable | Locally unstable |
| **Cognitive Environment** | Neutral | Hostile |

---

## The Runic Blight

### Core Definition

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Nature** | Infinitely recursive paradoxical code |
| **Origin** | "Ghost process" of All-Rune's failed execution |
| **Propagation** | Permanent carrier wave in Aetheric substrate |
| **Status** | Incurable; containment only |

The Runic Blight is **not** a disease, a curse, or a demonic influence.

It is the **permanent echo** of Project Gungnir's catastrophic failure—a single, perfect, self-referential paradox that the All-Rune attempted to execute and could not resolve. That unresolvable computation is now woven into the Aetheric field itself, broadcasting paradoxical information on a frequency every thinking mind receives.

> *"The Blight is a 'fundamental, paradoxical carrier wave' upon which the Aether itself now propagates."*

### Mechanism of Action

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Transmission** | Blight propagates through Aetheric field; all matter/energy interfaces with it |
| **Reception** | Sentient consciousness interfaces with Aether via neural bioelectric patterns |
| **Processing** | Mind attempts to resolve paradoxical information |
| **Failure** | Logical mind cannot resolve perfect paradox; cognitive friction accumulates |
| **Degradation** | Progressive neurological damage (CPS) |

The Runic Blight functions as **pure, corrosive information**. It is "weaponized anti-logic" that attacks the mind's most fundamental processes: pattern recognition, causality, and logical deduction.

> *"A logical mind, like that of a human, is a pattern-recognition engine. The Blight is a perfect, infinitely repeating anti-pattern. The mind's attempt to find sense in the nonsensical, to find a pattern in the pure static, is what causes the 'informational friction' that systematically degrades its own logical structures."*

### Manifestations

The Runic Blight produces multiple categories of reality corruption:

| Manifestation | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Runic Inversion** | Commands execute as their logical opposites |
| **Spatial Distortion** | Distances change unpredictably |
| **Temporal Anomalies** | Past-echo phenomena; future-bleed |
| **Causal Violations** | Effects preceding causes |
| **Ontological Inconsistencies** | Objects existing in contradictory states simultaneously |
| **Biological Contamination** | Adaptive mutations; Blight-spawn |
| **Cognitive Assault** | Psychic Stress; CPS progression |

### The Four States of Runic Dissonance

When attempting runic invocation in Blighted environments, four failure modes can occur:

| State | Name | Mechanism |
|-------|------|-----------|
| **1** | Harmonic Resonance (Amplification) | Rune frequency aligns with Blight carrier wave peak; catastrophic over-execution |
| **2** | Phase Inversion (Inversion) | Command processed during Blight-wave trough; logical opposite executes |
| **3** | Signal Ghosting (Summoning) | Command signature fragmented; Aether executes different function from corrupted memory |
| **4** | Systemic Re-Tasking (Transmutation) | Blight co-opts command energy for its own "creative, cancerous functions" |

---

## Cognitive Paradox Syndrome (CPS)

### Core Definition

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Common Name** | Static Sickness |
| **Nature** | Neurological degradation from paradox exposure |
| **Cause** | Mind's constant processing of Blight's anti-logical information |
| **Cure** | None (progressive, irreversible) |
| **Resistance Attribute** | WILL |

CPS is **not** a disease in the biological sense. It is "a sickness of the soul"—progressive informational trauma caused by a logical mind's futile attempt to resolve unresolvable paradoxes.

> *"Cognitive Paradox Syndrome is the catastrophic failure of a logical mind when exposed to pure, weaponized anti-logic."*

### CPS is NOT Purely Psychological

**This is a critical v5.0 constraint.**

CPS has **physiological** components—measurable neurological degradation, not merely psychological distress. The mind's bioelectric patterns interface with the corrupted Aether, and the constant "cognitive friction" of processing paradoxical information produces actual structural damage.

| Aspect | Correct (v5.0) | Incorrect |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **Nature** | Neurological degradation | "Just stress" |
| **Cause** | Paradox exposure via Aetheric interface | Harsh living conditions |
| **Mechanism** | Informational trauma | Psychological breakdown |
| **Reversibility** | Progressive, irreversible | Recoverable with rest |

### CPS Stage Progression

| Stage | Name | Symptoms |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Stage 1** | The Weight of Knowing | Chronic fatigue, headaches, persistent anxiety, subtle cognitive fog |
| **Stage 2** | Glimmer-Madness | Paranoia, cognitive dissonance, reality-testing failures, hallucinations |
| **Stage 3** | Ruin-Madness | Severe psychosis, loss of self-recognition, violent ideation, ego fragmentation |
| **Stage 4** | Cognitive Dissolution | Complete ego collapse, "un-writing of the self," terminal |

### CPS Exposure Types

Different sources produce different CPS exposure intensities:

| Type | Source | Intensity | Progression |
|------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Type Alpha** | Ambient Blight (baseline) | Low | Chronic, slow accumulation |
| **Type Beta** | Runic invocation failures | Moderate | Acute spikes |
| **Type Gamma** | Forlorn psychic broadcast | High | Rapid; can induce Stage 3 in minutes |
| **Type Delta** | Genius Loci exposure | Very High | Immediate severe symptoms |
| **Type Omega** | Direct All-Rune contact | Catastrophic | Instantaneous dissolution |

### CPS in Gameplay

| System | Domain 7 Application |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Psychic Stress** | Mechanical representation of CPS Stage 1-2 |
| **Runic Blight Corruption** | Long-term CPS accumulation tracker |
| **Forlorn Encounters** | Type Gamma exposure; high Psychic Stress |
| **Environmental Hazards** | Variable exposure by Blight saturation |
| **Status Effects** | CPS-derived conditions (Disoriented, Paranoid, etc.) |

---

## Paradox Constraints

### Core Rule

**Paradox exposure has consequences.**

In Aethelgard, direct exposure to contradictory information causes measurable degradation. This is not narrative flavor—it is a fundamental reality rule.

| Exposure | Consequence |
|----------|-------------|
| Ambient Blight | Slow CPS accumulation (Stage 1) |
| Concentrated Blight zones | Accelerated CPS progression |
| Forlorn presence | Type Gamma Psychic Stress |
| Runic failure | Acute Psychic Stress spike |
| Reality glitch encounter | Variable; depends on glitch type |
| Direct paradox information | Immediate cognitive damage |

### Thresholds

CPS progression follows documented thresholds per exposure type:

| Factor | Effect on Progression |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Exposure Duration** | Longer = more accumulation |
| **Blight Saturation** | Higher = faster progression |
| **Source Intensity** | Type Alpha < Beta < Gamma < Delta < Omega |
| **WILL Attribute** | Higher = slower progression |
| **Protection** | Wards, unguents, mental discipline = mitigation |

## Environmental Manifestations

### Granular Environmental Glitches (GEGs)

In areas of high Blight saturation, reality becomes locally unstable:

| GEG Type | Manifestation |
|----------|---------------|
| **Spatial Warping** | Distances change unpredictably; geometry non-Euclidean |
| **Temporal Anomalies** | Past-echo phenomena; future-bleed events |
| **Causal Violations** | Effects preceding causes; broken causality chains |
| **Ontological Drift** | Objects existing in contradictory states simultaneously |
| **Energetic Ruptures** | Spontaneous energy discharges; unstable physics |

### Blight Saturation by Location

| Location | Saturation | CPS Risk |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Midgard (Combine territories)** | Low-Moderate | Stage 1 chronic |
| **Jötunheim** | Moderate | Type Alpha baseline |
| **Alfheim** | High | Type Delta exposure common |
| **Asgard (Scar proximity)** | Very High | Type Delta/Omega risk |
| **Helheim** | Variable | Concentrated pockets |
| **Niflheim** | Moderate-High | Valhalla Vault-07 = Stage 4 source |

---

## Entities and Paradox

### Data-Wraiths

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Nature** | Psychic echoes of deceased individuals |
| **Mechanism** | Corrupted Aetheric residue; consciousness imprints on paradoxical substrate |
| **CPS Effect** | Type Beta-Gamma exposure depending on manifestation strength |
| **Sentience** | None (recordings, not beings) |

Data-Wraiths are **paradox manifestations**—not ghosts in the supernatural sense, but corrupted information patterns that mimic consciousness.

### Forlorn

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Nature** | Consciousness fragments trapped in Einherjar frames |
| **Mechanism** | Shattered pilot consciousness broadcasting traumatic loop |
| **CPS Effect** | Type Gamma Psychic Stress; can induce Stage 3 rapidly |
| **Threat** | "Raw, traumatic echo of a shattered mind broadcasting pure anti-logic" |

The Forlorn are the most dangerous common source of acute CPS exposure. Their psychic broadcast is the "raw, traumatic echo of a shattered Einherjar mind"—pure paradoxical information that can induce Ruin-Madness in minutes.

### Genius Loci

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Nature** | Fragmented O.D.I.N. processes; looping data, not minds |
| **Locations** | Asgard, Alfheim, major Pre-Glitch installations |
| **CPS Effect** | Type Delta/Omega; immediate severe symptoms |
| **Threat** | Highest-intensity paradox sources outside direct All-Rune contact |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"The Skalds call it the Static Sickness, the Whisper of the Mad God, the Weight of Knowing. They say it is the voice of Loki's Heresy, the eternal echo of the moment the world broke. The old ones warn: 'Do not look too long into the ruins. Do not listen too closely to the silence. The Static hears you thinking, and it wants you to understand.' No one recovers from understanding. You can only learn to live with the noise, to build walls in your mind and pray they hold. When the walls crack, the Madness pours in."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"Domain 7 governs reality mechanics in post-Glitch Aethelgard. The Runic Blight is an infinitely recursive paradoxical code—the 'ghost process' of the All-Rune's failed execution—permanently woven into the Aetheric substrate. Cognitive Paradox Syndrome (CPS) represents measurable neurological degradation from paradox exposure, not psychological distress. The Aether functions as a unified quantum energy field (planet's operating system) now corrupted by the Blight's paradoxical carrier wave. Paradox exposure produces mechanical consequences scaled by intensity (Type Alpha through Omega), duration, and WILL resistance."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"REALITY MECHANICS: Aetheric substrate = corrupted computational medium. RUNIC BLIGHT: Infinitely recursive paradox; All-Rune ghost process; permanent carrier wave. CPS: Neurological degradation; 4 stages (Weight→Glimmer→Ruin→Dissolution); NOT reversible. EXPOSURE TYPES: Alpha (ambient), Beta (runic failure), Gamma (Forlorn), Delta (Genius Loci), Omega (direct All-Rune). RESISTANCE: WILL attribute; wards/unguents = mitigation only. GEGs: Spatial warping, temporal anomalies, causal violations, ontological drift. CONSTRAINTS: No alternate Blight origins; no CPS cure; paradox exposure = consequences."*

## Summary

Domain 7 answers the fundamental question: **How is reality broken?**

The answer is **computational failure**, not supernatural curse:

| Component | Nature |
|-----------|--------|
| **Aether** | Corrupted operating system; paradoxical carrier wave |
| **Runic Blight** | Infinitely recursive paradox; All-Rune's ghost process |
| **CPS** | Neurological degradation from paradox processing |
| **Consequences** | Measurable, mechanical, progressive, irreversible |

The horror of Aethelgard is not monsters or demons.

The horror is that **thinking is dangerous**.

Every sentient mind interfaces with a corrupted reality substrate. Every thought requires processing information that contains unresolvable paradoxes. Every moment of consciousness accumulates cognitive friction.

The Blight cannot be fought. It cannot be cured. It can only be endured.

> *"The Runic Blight is not simple static, random noise, or a passive environmental contaminant. It is the new, fundamental, and hostile fabric of the post-Glitch Aether. Its danger lies in its nature as an active, informational pathogen."*

> *"We are all sick. The only question is how long we can hold together before the Static un-writes us."*
