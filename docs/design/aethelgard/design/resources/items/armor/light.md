# Light Armor

## Overview

| Property | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Philosophy** | Minimal protection, maximum mobility |
| **Armor Types** | Cloth, padded, leather, hide, studded leather |
| **Full Set Soak** | **6 Soak** (Head: 1, Chest: 2, Hands: 1, Legs: 1, Feet: 1) |
| **Penalties** | None |
| **Proficiency** | All archetypes (Universal) |
| **Best For** | Skirmishers, Mystics, Adepts; FINESSE-focused builds; characters prioritizing evasion |
| **Common Names** | Second-Skin, Trail-Wear, The Light Burden, Shadowcloak |

> **Diagnostic Notes:** Light armor represents the optimal balance for characters who rely on not being hit rather than absorbing damage. The absence of penalties allows full utilization of FINESSE-based evasion and mobility. Rangers Guild personnel universally wear light armor for extended patrol operations—the weight savings translate directly to additional water, food, and trade goods capacity.

## A. Cloth & Padded Armor

| Property | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Examples** | Robes, cloaks, padded garments, quilted jackets, gambeson |
| **Soak per Piece** | Head: 1, Chest: 2, Hands: 1, Legs: 1, Feet: 1 |
| **Full Set Soak** | 6 Soak |
| **Penalties** | None |
| **Special Properties** | **[Concealable]** — Can be worn under clothing; **[Silent]** — No noise penalty |
| **Proficiency Required** | Light Armor Proficiency (Universal) |
| **Common Names** | Soft-Shell, The Quiet Wrap, Wanderer's Wear, Traveler's Second Skin |

> **Diagnostic Notes:** Cloth armor represents the minimum viable protection—layers of fabric providing modest resistance to cuts and impacts. The gambeson (quilted jacket filled with wool or cotton) offers surprisingly effective protection against slashing weapons while remaining light and flexible. Scriptorium scholars universally wear padded robes; the garments provide modest protection without interfering with research activities or Galdr channeling.

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | **Scrap Wrappings** (Jury-Rigged) | 4 Soak | 15 PS | Improvised; tears easily |

## B. Leather Armor

| Property | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Examples** | Leather jerkin, hide armor, cured leather, boiled leather |
| **Soak per Piece** | Head: 1, Chest: 2, Hands: 1, Legs: 1, Feet: 1 |
| **Full Set Soak** | 6 Soak |
| **Penalties** | None |
| **Special Properties** | **[Water Resistant]** — Reduces environmental penalties in rain/wet conditions |
| **Proficiency Required** | Light Armor Proficiency (Universal) |
| **Common Names** | Beast-Hide, The Cured Shell, Hunter's Second Skin, Trail-Leather |

> **Diagnostic Notes:** Leather armor represents the workhorse of post-Glitch protection—readily available from beast hides, easily worked by community tanners, and providing reliable protection without mobility sacrifice. The curing process (boiling in wax or oil) hardens the leather significantly, improving slash resistance. Rangers and Rust-Clan salvagers overwhelmingly favor leather armor for its balance of protection, weight, and availability.

### Example Armor

| Tier | Name (Quality) | Soak (Full Set) | Value (PS) | Special |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | **Scrap Leather Vest** (Jury-Rigged) | 4 Soak | 20 PS | Gaps in coverage; -1 Defense |
| 1 | **Salvaged Hide Armor** (Scavenged) | 6 Soak | 80 PS | Standard; [Water Resistant] |
| 2 | **Clan Cured Leather** (Clan-Forged) | 7 Soak | 220 PS | [Water Resistant]; +1 to tracking |
| 3 | **Dvergr Treated Leather** (Dvergr-Forged) | 9 Soak | 620 PS | Acid resistant; +2 Defense vs. Blight-touched |
| 5 | **Fenrir's Hide** (Myth-Forged) | 9 Soak | 12,000 PS | Regenerates 1 HP/round; immune to [Fear]; +3 MIGHT |

## C. Studded Leather Armor

| Property | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Examples** | Studded leather, brigandine (light), reinforced leather, metal-dotted hide |
| **Soak per Piece** | Head: 1, Chest: 2, Hands: 1, Legs: 1, Feet: 1 |
| **Full Set Soak** | 6 Soak |
| **Penalties** | None |
| **Special Properties** | **[Reinforced]** — +1 Soak vs. slashing damage specifically |
| **Proficiency Required** | Light Armor Proficiency (Universal) |
| **Common Names** | Dot-Hide, The Studded Shell, Nail-Leather, Metal-Teeth Armor |

> **Diagnostic Notes:** Studded leather bridges the gap between light and medium armor—leather reinforced with metal rivets, studs, or small plates at critical strike points. The metal components deflect blade edges that would otherwise slice through plain leather. Lex-Guardian auxiliaries favor studded leather; the armor provides enhanced protection during Scriptorium patrol without the mobility penalties of heavier options.

### Example Armor

| Tier | Name (Quality) | Soak (Full Set) | Value (PS) | Special |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | **Nail-Punched Hide** (Jury-Rigged) | 4 Soak | 25 PS | Studs work loose; requires daily maintenance |
| 1 | **Salvaged Studded Leather** (Scavenged) | 6 Soak | 100 PS | [Reinforced] |
| 2 | **Clan-Riveted Armor** (Clan-Forged) | 7 Soak | 280 PS | [Reinforced]; +1 Defense |
| 3 | **Dvergr Brigandine (Light)** (Dvergr-Forged) | 9 Soak | 700 PS | [Reinforced]; flexible; +2 to Acrobatics |
| 5 | **Shadowsteel Studded** (Myth-Forged) | 9 Soak | 9,800 PS | [Reinforced]; [Silent]; +3 to Stealth; critical hits against wearer have 50% miss chance |
