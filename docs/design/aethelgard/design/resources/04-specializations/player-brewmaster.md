# The Brewmaster — The Alchemist of a Corrupted World

> *"You see poison. I see potential. You see rot. I see reagents. You see the sickness that's unwriting reality. I see a thousand recipes waiting to be distilled. The world is dying, yes—but I've learned to bottle its death throes and throw them at the things that killed it."*
> — Greta Half-Hand, Master Brewer, Golden Serpent Guild

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Adept |
| **Role** | Alchemical Support, Tactical Grenadier, Consumable Crafter |
| **Path Type** | Coherent (with Moderate Trauma Risk) |
| **Primary Attribute** | WITS |
| **Secondary Attribute** | FINESSE |
| **Resource System** | Stamina |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | Moderate (crafting with Blighted components) |
| **Unlock Cost** | 10 PP |

The **Brewmaster** is not a traditional alchemist.

They are a **pragmatic synthesizer of corruption**.

They have learned that the most potent reagents now grow in the most corrupted soil—that the sickness of the world itself can be distilled, fermented, and weaponized. Where the Bone-Setter works to purify and heal, and the Einbúi improvises survival basics, the Brewmaster deliberately interfaces with the Blight, transforming its symptoms into solutions.

They are the alchemist of a broken world—distilling order from chaos, bottling courage and destruction in equal measure.

To choose the Brewmaster is to embrace the fantasy of the **alchemical grenadier**—the vital party buffer whose pouch is never empty, whose flasks turn allies into heroes and enemies into ash. Your saga is written in the potent elixirs that steady hands and the shattering explosions that reshape lanes.

Your power is preparation. Your danger is the corruption you handle to create it.

## Core Philosophy: Distilling Order from Ruin

### The Art of Blighted Brewing

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Synthesis, Not Purity** | The world is sick—use the sickness as a tool |
| **Preparation Over Improvisation** | Power is front-loaded; the field reaps what the bench sowed |
| **Right Brew, Right Breath, Right Throw** | Tactical deployment requires timing and coordination |
| **Dangerous Knowledge** | The most powerful effects require the most dangerous ingredients |

The Brewmaster's power comes from a philosophy of **dangerous synthesis**. They take the corrupted flora and fauna—the symptoms of the Blight—and through their craft, transform them into potent solutions.

They do not fear the Blight. They do not flee from tainted reagents. They have learned that the very entropy unwriting reality can be distilled, fermented, and weaponized into something useful.

> *"The Brewmaster is an alchemist of a different, more dangerous sort. They have learned that the most potent reagents now grow in the most corrupted soil and that the sickness of the world itself can be distilled, fermented, and weaponized."*

### The Coherent Adept with Moderate Risk

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Coherent (crafting, not channeling entropy directly) |
| **Risk Level** | Moderate (Corruption risk during crafting with Blighted components) |
| **Corruption Source** | Failed crafting checks with [Blighted] reagents |
| **Stress Source** | Volatile handling; fume exposure; batch failures |

The Brewmaster is a **Coherent** specialization—their art is dangerous but not inherently heretical like the Rust-Witch or Blót-Priest. They do not deliberately channel entropy or make blood sacrifices.

But they have **deliberate Trauma Economy exposure**. Crafting the most powerful concoctions requires [Blighted] components, a process that carries a direct risk of inflicting Runic Blight Corruption on the crafter during a failed check.

The corruption gain is not mystical punishment; it is *contamination*. Each handling of tainted reagents is an exposure risk, and the Blight's logic-corruption can seep through gloves and masks into the practitioner's system.

> *"They are the Adept who most willingly interfaces with the Blight. Their choice to use [Blighted] reagents is a constant risk/reward calculation."*

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Alchemical grenadier; the one who always has the right flask |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Preparatory support with tactical deployment moments |
| **Success Metric** | Allies buffed; enemies debuffed; battlefield controlled |
| **Decision Space** | "What do I craft before the expedition? Which flask do I throw now?" |

Playing a Brewmaster is about **preparation, timing, and tactical versatility**.

Your gameplay loop:
- **Prepare**: Craft consumables at the Alchemist's Lab before expeditions
- **Equip**: Load your pouch with the right mix of buffs, bombs, and cures
- **Deploy**: Choose the perfect moment to buff an ally or control a lane
- **Adapt**: You have solutions for everything—if you prepared correctly

You are the ultimate preparer. Your power is determined by what you brought to the fight, not what you can do in the moment. A well-stocked Brewmaster is a one-person army of utility. An empty-pouched Brewmaster is just another pair of hands.

Every expedition begins with a question: *"What will we face? What should I brew?"*

> *"The Brewmaster is the ultimate expression of the 'preparation is everything' philosophy. A Brewmaster who returns to town and spends their resources crafting a wide array of bombs and potions is a one-person army of utility for the next expedition."*

## Core Mechanics

### Blighted Alchemy

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Crafting Discipline** | Blighted Alchemy (non-artisan) |
| **Location** | Alchemist's Lab (settlement) |
| **Skill Check** | WITS + Blighted Alchemy + bonuses |
| **Corruption Risk** | Failed checks with [Blighted] components |

The **Blighted Alchemy** mechanic is the heart of the Brewmaster's power. They are masters of creating single-use consumable items—potent drinks, volatile bombs, and miraculous cures.

| Output Type | Examples | Function |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Tactical Libations** | Inspiring Mead, Stoneskin Stout, Mind-Calming Mead | Single-target buffs |
| **Volatile Concoctions** | Fire-Ale Bomb, Ensnaring Sap Bomb, Blight-Tox Bomb | AoE damage and control |
| **Curative Elixirs** | The Panacea | Status removal and healing |

The danger lies in the ingredients. Standard herbs make standard potions. But the *powerful* effects—the ones that can turn a battle—require [Blighted] components. Harvesting and handling these tainted reagents risks Corruption.

> *"Crafting with [Blighted] materials is the only way to create their most powerful effects but carries a direct risk of inflicting Runic Blight Corruption on the Brewmaster."*

### Tactical Deployment

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Combat Action** | `use item` command |
| **Thrown Bombs** | FINESSE-based ranged attack |
| **Administered Drinks** | Standard Action, touch range |
| **Timing** | Coordination with party; lane and count |

The Brewmaster's in-combat contribution is the **tactical deployment** of their prepared consumables. Their abilities are not spells—they are the act of using powerful, unique items only they can create.

| Deployment Type | Action | Target |
|-----------------|--------|--------|
| **Buff (Drink)** | Standard Action | Single ally (touch) |
| **Bomb (Throw)** | Standard Action | Row or single target (ranged) |
| **Cure (Elixir)** | Standard Action | Single ally (touch) |

**Field Timing Protocol** (Layer 2):
- **Right Brew, Right Breath, Right Throw**: Announce lane and count
- **Never Throw Upwind**: Post warnings for smoke and fire
- **Pairing Discipline**: Stoneskin to wall-holders, Inspiring to knife-hands

> *"Voice and cup together shrink panic spirals. Skald cadence plus Inspiring Mead steadies lines."*

### Masterwork Creation

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Trigger** | Critical Success on crafting check |
| **Effect** | [Masterwork] version of consumable |
| **Enhancement** | Significantly improved primary effect |
| **Economy** | Higher value for sale or use |

The **Masterwork Creation** mechanic represents the Brewmaster's pursuit of alchemical excellence. When they achieve a Critical Success on a crafting check, they produce not a standard item but a [Masterwork]—a consumable of legendary quality.

| Standard | Masterwork Enhancement |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Inspiring Mead** | +3 damage dice instead of +2 |
| **Stoneskin Stout** | +4 Soak instead of +3 |
| **Fire-Ale Bomb** | Also applies [Burning] status |
| **Ensnaring Sap Bomb** | Also has chance to [Root] targets |

> *"On a Critical Success during a crafting check, they can create a [Masterwork] version of a consumable with significantly enhanced effects."*

| **Inspiring Mead** | Active | 35 Stamina | Single-target buff: [Inspired] for 3 rounds (+2 damage dice, Fear resistance) |
| **Fire-Ale Bomb** | Active | 40 Stamina | Thrown attack: moderate Fire damage to all enemies in target row |

**Alchemical Knowledge I** is your foundational expertise. You have a deep, practical knowledge of herbalism and the strange, new reagents of the Blighted world. You know the dangerous tells of corrupted flora—and you know how to handle them safely.

> *"The Brewmaster has a deep, practical knowledge of herbalism and natural reagents, including the dangerous tells of Blighted flora."*

**Inspiring Mead** is the morale-boosting draught. You pass a flask of specially brewed, courage-inducing mead to an ally. The potent drink warms the belly and fortifies the will against the horrors to come. [Inspired] grants bonus damage and Fear resistance.

**Fire-Ale Bomb** is your core offensive tool. You hurl a tightly-sealed cask of highly volatile, quick-to-ignite ale. The cask shatters on impact, engulfing an area in a searing flash of flame. Moderate Fire damage to an entire row.

### Tier 2 — Advanced Concoctions

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Stoneskin Stout** | Active | 40 Stamina | Single-target buff: [Fortified] for 3 rounds (+3 Soak) |
| **Ensnaring Sap Bomb** | Active | 45 Stamina | Thrown attack: creates [Difficult Terrain] in target row for 2 rounds + [Slowed] to all enemies |
| **Potent Potables** | Passive | — | Duration of all buff/debuff effects from Brewmaster consumables increased by 1 round |

**Stoneskin Stout** is the defensive buff. A thick, gritty, mineral-rich stout that, when consumed, temporarily hardens the drinker's skin to the consistency of stone. +3 Soak for 3 rounds makes your Tank nearly invincible.

> *"A thick, gritty, mineral-rich stout that, when consumed, temporarily hardens the drinker's skin to the consistency of stone."*

**Ensnaring Sap Bomb** is your battlefield control tool. You throw a flask of incredibly sticky, fast-hardening sap—often harvested from Blight-twisted trees. Enemies caught in the zone are [Slowed] and struggling through [Difficult Terrain].

**Potent Potables** is the duration extender. Your brewing techniques have achieved peak stability. Every buff and debuff from your consumables lasts one round longer than normal—turning 3-round effects into 4-round effects.

### Tier 3 — Mastery of the Keg

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Blight-Tox Bomb** | Active | 50 Stamina | Thrown attack: no physical damage, but inflicts moderate Psychic Stress to all enemies in target row + chance for [Disoriented] |
| **Corrosive Concoction** | Active | 50 Stamina | Thrown attack: low Arcane damage to single target + [Corroded] for 3 rounds |
| **Master Brewer** | Passive | — | Chance to not consume reagents when crafting; Critical Success creates [Masterwork]; +1d10 to Resolve vs Corruption when crafting with [Blighted] components |

**Blight-Tox Bomb** is your psychic weapon. A dangerous and unstable brew created from the distilled essence of [Blighted] flora and fauna. The fragile clay pot shatters and releases a cloud of psychoactive, sanity-eroding toxins. No physical damage—but it inflicts Psychic Stress on every enemy in a row.

> *"A dangerous and unstable brew created from the distilled essence of [Blighted] flora and fauna. The Brewmaster hurls a fragile clay pot that shatters and releases a cloud of psychoactive, sanity-eroding toxins."*

**Corrosive Concoction** is the tank-buster. A flask of pure, weaponized entropy that eats through armor with terrifying speed. Low damage, but the [Corroded] status strips Soak from heavily armored foes—setting up your party's physical damage dealers.

**Master Brewer** is the efficiency capstone. Your mastery is legendary. You stretch resources like no other, sometimes not consuming reagents at all. Your Critical Successes produce [Masterwork] items. And when handling [Blighted] components, your practiced discipline grants bonus resistance to Corruption.

### Capstone — The Panacea

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Cost** | 60 Stamina |
| **Frequency** | Once per combat |
| **Target** | Single ally (or self) |
| **Effect** | Remove ALL negative physical and mental status effects + temporary immunity for 2 rounds |
| **Crafting** | Requires [Legendary Component] |

The capstone **The Panacea** represents the Brewmaster's magnum opus—the alchemical miracle. It is a shimmering, golden liquid that can purge both physical and metaphysical ailments, a perfect synthesis of alchemy and an understanding of the Blight's nature.

> *"The Brewmaster's magnum opus, a legendary and incredibly rare brew known as 'The Panacea.' It is a shimmering, golden liquid that can purge both physical and metaphysical ailments."*

One dose. One ally. Complete purification.

[Poisoned], [Bleeding], [Feared], [Disoriented]—all gone. Plus temporary immunity to both physical and mental status effects for 2 rounds. This is the ultimate cure—the ability to completely reset an ally's condition in a single action.

Crafting The Panacea requires extremely rare and highly Corrupted components. The recipe itself is legendary and incredibly difficult. Only Master Brewers even attempt it.

## Systemic Integration

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Source | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Standard Crafting** | No Corruption risk (mundane reagents) |
| **[Blighted] Crafting** | Failed WITS check inflicts Corruption |
| **Volatile Handling** | Fume exposure; bench risk |
| **Master Brewer** | +1d10 to Resolve vs Corruption when crafting |

The Brewmaster has **deliberate Trauma Economy exposure**. They can craft safely with mundane reagents—but the powerful effects require [Blighted] components, which carry Corruption risk on failed checks.

This creates a strategic choice: play it safe with standard consumables, or risk contamination for the truly devastating brews.

### Mitigation Tools

| Tool | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Alchemical Knowledge I** | Higher chance to harvest [Blighted] components safely |
| **Master Brewer** | +1d10 to Resolve vs Corruption during crafting |
| **Bench Discipline** | Proper protocols reduce risk (Layer 2) |
| **Bone-Setter Oversight** | CPS checks after exposure spikes |

The Brewmaster has built-in mitigation through their passives and careful bench discipline. But they still interface with the Blight more directly than other Coherent Adepts.

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Berserkr** | Inspiring Mead + damage buff amplifies their already high damage |
| **Skjaldmær** | Stoneskin Stout turns the Tank into an immovable wall |
| **Skald** | Voice + cup together steady lines; cadence plus mead shrinks panic spirals |
| **Hlekkr-master** | Ensnaring Sap Bomb + chains creates total lane control |
| **Physical Damage Dealers** | Corrosive Concoction strips armor for follow-up strikes |

> *"The Brewmaster is the ultimate synergistic support. They can give the Berserker a damage buff, the Skjaldmær a defensive buff, and control the battlefield with their bombs to set up combos for the entire party."*

The Brewmaster is the **versatile glue** that holds a diverse party together. They can buff anyone, debuff anything, and control any lane—as long as they prepared the right consumables.

### Counter-Synergies

| Situation | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| **No Prep Time** | Without crafting access, the Brewmaster has no tools |
| **Reagent Scarcity** | Empty pouches mean empty contributions |
| **Fire-Resistant Enemies** | Fire-Ale Bomb is useless; need alternative bombs |
| **Ambush Scenarios** | Power is front-loaded; surprise attacks catch them unprepared |

---

## Lore Integration

### Blighted Brewing Tradition

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Historical Roots** | Keg tricks and loose bottles; early show brews burned camps |
| **Codification** | Reader governance imposed ledgers, fume rules, and custody |
| **Modern Practice** | Reproducible craft with corridor safety protocols |
| **Social Function** | Morale engine; grid partner for tactical teams |

The Brewmaster tradition evolved from early post-Glitch survivors who discovered that Blighted flora had strange, potent properties. Early "keg tricks" were dangerous—loose bottles burned camps and markets. Reader governance imposed ledgers, fume rules, and custody protocols, halving incidents within a season.

> *"Early show brews and loose bottles burned camps and markets. Reader governance imposed ledgers, fume rules, and custody, halving incidents in gate towns within a season."*

### The Golden Serpent Guild

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Dangerous Synthesis** | Transform symptoms of the Blight into solutions |
| **Bench Discipline** | Sanitize glass, weigh true, bead last, wax-cap, sleeve in cloth |
| **Field Timing** | Right brew, right breath, right throw |
| **Custody Protocols** | Kaupmaðr logs batches; custody prevents panic and counterfeits |

The Golden Serpent Guild is the primary faction of Brewmasters—pragmatic, often reckless, students of Blighted alchemy. They are the true pragmatists of the Age of Echoes, not wizards but the world's first and most daring toxicologists.

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Golden Serpent Guild** | Core practitioners; bench discipline and field deployment |
| **Jötun-Readers** | Respect the reproducibility; question the Blight interface |
| **Bone-Setters** | Wary allies; overlapping expertise, different philosophies |
| **Dvergr** | Distrustful; prefer physics and Pure Steel over alchemy |
| **Iron-Banes** | Suspicious of Blight handling; accept results grudgingly |

> *"The Alchemists are the true pragmatists of the Age of Echoes. They are not wizards, but the world's first and most daring toxicologists."*

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the tales, they are the poison-tenders, the keg-sages, the bottle-throwers. They are the ones who learned to brew courage from corrupted roots and bottle fire in clay pots. When the line wavers, they pass the cup that steadies hands. When the enemy presses, they throw the flask that turns a lane to flame. They walk with pouches full of miracles and catastrophes, each vial a decision between salvation and destruction. They do not fear the Blight; they have learned to drink it, distill it, and throw it back at the things that killed the world. They are the heart of a party's morale and the fire at its fingertips. They never run dry. They always have one more flask."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Brewmaster (Alchemist of a Corrupted World) represents the Coherent Adept specialization optimized for consumable crafting and tactical deployment. Mechanical role: preparatory support with buff/debuff/control versatility. Key differentiator: power is front-loaded through pre-expedition crafting; in-combat contribution depends on prepared inventory. Core mechanics: Blighted Alchemy crafting (WITS-based, Corruption risk with [Blighted] components), Tactical Deployment (FINESSE-based thrown attacks), Masterwork Creation (Critical Success produces enhanced items). Signature ability: The Panacea (once per combat, removes all negative status effects + immunity). Trauma Economy interaction: Moderate risk—Corruption only occurs on failed crafting checks with [Blighted] reagents. Optimal deployment: parties needing versatile support, expeditions with access to Alchemist's Labs, encounters requiring diverse solutions."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Brewmaster (Alchemist of a Corrupted World). ARCHETYPE: Adept. PATH TYPE: Coherent (Moderate Trauma Risk). ROLE: Alchemical Support / Tactical Grenadier / Consumable Crafter. PRIMARY STAT: WITS. SECONDARY STAT: FINESSE. RESOURCE: Stamina. CORE MECHANICS: Blighted Alchemy (crafting discipline, Corruption risk on failed [Blighted] checks), Tactical Deployment (use item command, FINESSE-based throws), Masterwork Creation (Critical Success produces [Masterwork] items). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Fermentation): Alchemical Knowledge I, Inspiring Mead, Fire-Ale Bomb. T2 (Advanced Concoctions): Stoneskin Stout, Ensnaring Sap Bomb, Potent Potables. T3 (Mastery of the Keg): Blight-Tox Bomb, Corrosive Concoction, Master Brewer. CAPSTONE: The Panacea (60 Stamina, once per combat, removes all negative physical/mental status effects + 2-round immunity).

## Summary

The Brewmaster is the **alchemist of a corrupted world**.

Where others flee from tainted reagents, the Brewmaster deliberately handles them. They have learned that the sickness unwriting reality can be distilled, fermented, and weaponized into powerful solutions.

Their power is preparation. A well-stocked Brewmaster arrives at every fight with exactly the right flasks: Inspiring Mead to boost damage, Stoneskin Stout to harden the Tank, Fire-Ale Bombs to clear lanes, Ensnaring Sap to control movement, and Blight-Tox Bombs to assault enemy sanity.

The Panacea—their capstone—is the alchemical miracle: a single dose that removes all negative status effects and grants temporary immunity. It is the ultimate reset button, crafted from legendary components through legendary skill.

Their Trauma Economy interaction is deliberate and moderate. Standard crafting is safe. But the *powerful* effects—the ones that can turn expeditions—require [Blighted] components. Every Brewmaster must decide how much risk they're willing to accept for how much power.

They are the versatile glue of any party. They can buff anyone, debuff anything, and control any lane. They are the morale engine and the grid partner. Voice and cup together steady lines.

But their power is front-loaded. An unprepared Brewmaster is just another pair of hands. A fully-stocked Brewmaster is a one-person army of utility.

*You see poison.*
*I see potential.*
*You see rot.*
*I see reagents.*
*And I always have one more flask.*
