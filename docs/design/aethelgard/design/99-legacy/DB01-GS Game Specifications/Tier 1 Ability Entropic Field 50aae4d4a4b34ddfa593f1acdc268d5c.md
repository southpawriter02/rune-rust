## Core Identity

**Specialization:** Rust-Witch (Agent of Entropy)

**Tier:** 1 (Foundational Entropy)

**Type:** Active (Standard Action)

**Prerequisite:** Unlock the Rust-Witch Specialization (10 PP)

**Cost:** 3 PP

---

## Description

You gesture broadly, creating a shimmering field of accelerated decay that settles over an area like toxic fog. Within the zone, metal visibly tarnishes, oxidation spreads rapidly, and structural integrity weakens. This is not a direct curse but an environmental alteration—you're making the air itself corrosive.

## Mechanics

### Action Economy

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Action Cost** | Standard Action |
| **Resource Cost** | 30 Aether |
| **Targeting** | One row (Front or Back) |
| **Duration** | 2 turns |

### Zone Effect

- Create **[Entropic Field]** zone covering target row
- All enemies starting turn in zone: **-2 Armor Value penalty**
- This is a debuff, NOT a DoT like [Corroded]
- Zone persists even if you move or die

### Stacking Rules

- Multiple Entropic Fields do **NOT** stack (same debuff)
- **DOES** stack with [Corroded] status (different source)
- No Corruption cost (environmental magic, not entropy channeling)

---

## Tactical Applications

1. **Zone Control:** Area denial and positioning tool—force enemies to choose between debuff zone or repositioning
2. **Armor Shredding:** Stack with [Corroded] for maximum Soak reduction
3. **Setup Tool:** Place this, then spam Corrosive Curse on enemies stuck in it
4. **Sustainable:** Unlike curses, this doesn't corrupt you

---

## Integration Notes

- **Combo Potential:** Entropic Field (-2) + Corrosive Curse stacks (-2 each) = devastating armor reduction
- **Party Synergy:** Physical damage dealers benefit massively from armor reduction
- **Safe Option:** No Corruption cost makes this ideal for sustained zone control
