## Codex Entry: Berserkr Rage Brew (The Blood-Spark)

*Jötun-Reader Field Notation: The following entry synthesizes five evidence fragments recovered between 775-783 PG. Unlock thresholds defined per Alchemy protocol. Extreme caution advised—substance represents significant physiological and psychological hazard.*

---

## 1.0 Overview

The Berserkr Rage Brew—known to warriors as The Blood-Spark and to Alchemists as a "controlled berserkergang inducer"—represents humanity's desperate attempt to weaponize the body's own limits. This fiery, bitter concoction burns on the tongue and electrifies the senses, turning the blood to liquid fire.

The brew's purpose is singular: to induce a temporary state of extreme aggression, heightened combat efficacy, and profound suppression of pain and fear—making it a last-resort for desperate warriors and Rig-Crews in the most brutal conflicts. Yet, like all bargains struck with the broken world, this borrowed fury exacts a profound cost.

---

## 2.0 Composition & Genesis

The brew represents a fusion of three distinct elements:

- **Crag-Goat Horn Shavings:** Bio-electric stimulant derived from creatures that function as "living grounding rods." Provides the characteristic "electrifies the senses" effect and ozone-copper taste.
- **Fenrir Blood (Purified):** Volatile essence from Class-Omega bio-weapons engineered for controlled aggression. The Gleipnir paradox—predator biologically incapable of submission yet forced into obedience—infuses the compound with its unstable fury.
- **Muspelheim Slag-Minerals:** Thermal stabilizers harvested near Gjöllflow Rivers, preventing catastrophic degradation of the psychoactive components.

---

## 3.0 The Berserkr State

Physiological and psychological effects proceed through documented stages:

### Activation Phase (0-5 minutes)

- Uncontrolled surge of endogenous stimulants
- Extreme strength and endurance increase
- Profound insensitivity to pain
- Bio-Aetheric Field becomes wildly unstable (flickering aura)

### Peak Phase (5-45 minutes)

- "Terrifying, animalistic fury"—heedless of pain, capable of impossible feats
- Perception narrowly focused on immediate threats
- Indiscriminate aggression toward perceived threats
- Limited resistance to minor runic effects; vulnerability to concentrated Aetheric attacks

### Crash Phase (Post-Peak)

- Profound exhaustion and disorientation
- Post-State Amnesia ("red haze" or "waking dream")
- Complete physical and mental depletion
- Heightened vulnerability to environmental and psychic hazards
- Potential CPS exacerbation for those with pre-existing Static Sickness

---

## 4.0 Strategic Assessment

The brew represents an "ultimate gamble"—capable of breaking enemy lines but equally capable of turning on allies. Factional perspectives diverge sharply:

- **Warriors:** Last-resort combat augmentation; decisive but unpredictable
- **Jötun-Readers:** Living case study in extreme physiological stress and Blight interaction
- **Iron-Banes:** "Wild purifiers"—useful against Iron-Husks, but cursed and impure
- **Dvergr:** Illogical anomaly; focus on counter-frequency dampening fields

## Unlock Thresholds — Alchemy Protocol

| Threshold | Reveals |
|-----------|---------|
| 20% | Common name ("Blood-Spark"), general effect (combat rage), extreme danger warning |
| 40% | Three-component composition, Muspelheim origin of stabilizers, basic duration (~45 min) |
| 60% | Activation/Peak/Crash phase progression, Post-State Amnesia, "ultimate gamble" tactical profile |
| 80% | Fenrir blood origin (Gleipnir paradox), Bio-Aetheric Field instability, CPS interaction risks |
| 100% | Full formulation details, counter-measures (Dvergr dampening fields), ethical/theological implications |

---

> **LEAD PATHOLOGIST'S NOTE:** The Berserkr who drinks the Blood-Spark does not become stronger. They become consumed. They trade their future—their memory, their sanity, their very coherence—for a few minutes of borrowed fury. The Alchemist who brews it is not a healer but a weapons-smith, forging living weapons from desperate souls.

## Data Capture 4: Hearth-Clan Warrior Testimony

**Oral History — Hearth-Clan Warrior Testimony: "The Bargain of Borrowed Fury"**

> **MINIMAL LOG CONTEXT:**
> - **Date Window:** Year 781 PG, autumn gathering
> - **Observer:** Jötun-Reader Field Archivist (name withheld)
> - **Threshold:** Cultural preservation—combat stimulant usage traditions
> - **Decision:** Testimony recorded for posterity; warrior declined further interviews

### Evidence Excerpt (L1 dialectal voice, Hearth-Clan elder warrior)

*[Speaker: Veteran shield-bearer, approximately 60 winters. Right arm missing below elbow. Voice steady but distant.]*

> "You want to know about the Blood-Spark? Aye, I'll tell you. Once. Then we don't speak of it again."
>
> "I was young. Stupid. We all were. The Husks came—not the shuffling kind, the fast ones, the ones that remember how to fight. Our line was breaking. Commander handed out the vials. Said it was 'the last resort.' Said we'd be unstoppable."
>
> "She was right. And she was wrong."
>
> "I remember drinking it. Fire in my throat. Lightning in my blood. Then... nothing. A red dream. Screaming—mine, theirs, everyone's. I woke up three days later in the healer's tent. They told me I'd killed seventeen Husks with my bare hands after my blade broke. They also told me I'd killed Bjorn. My shield-brother. He'd tried to pull me back from the line when the crash started."
>
> *[Long silence]*
>
> "The Blood-Spark doesn't make you stronger, girl. It makes you empty. It takes everything you are—your fear, your pain, your judgment—and burns it for fuel. And when the fire goes out, you're left with ashes. Ashes and the faces of everyone you couldn't recognize in the red haze."
>
> "There's a saying in the Hearth-Clans: *'The man who drinks the fury dies twice—once in the battle, once in the remembering.'* I've died twice. I won't die a third time."
>
> *[Testimony ends. Subject declined follow-up questions.]*

## Data Capture 5: Visual Survey of Blood-Spark Activation

**Oral History — Hearth-Clan Warrior Testimony: "The Bargain of Borrowed Fury"**

> **MINIMAL LOG CONTEXT:**
> - **Date Window:** Year 780 PG
> - **Observer:** Scriptorium-Primus Field Documentation Team
> - **Threshold:** Controlled observation of sanctioned Blood-Spark deployment (Ranger training exercise)
> - **Decision:** Visual documentation compiled for training and research purposes
> - **OWNER:** Division of Combat Pharmacology

### Evidence Excerpt (L3 technical description)

> **VISUAL SURVEY: BLOOD-SPARK ACTIVATION SEQUENCE**
> - **Recording Method:** Runic light-capture array, distance 50 paces
> - **Subject:** Volunteer Ranger (informed consent documented)
> - **Environment:** Controlled training arena, Pure Forge Crossroads

**FRAME SEQUENCE ANALYSIS:**

> **T+0:00 (Consumption):** Subject drinks standard 50ml dosage. Immediate grimace—confirms bitter, burning taste. Ozone-copper odor detectable at observation distance.
>
> **T+0:30 (Initial Response):** Pupil dilation visible. Subject reports "electricity in the blood." Skin flush beginning at neck, spreading to face and arms.
>
> **T+2:00 (Activation Phase):** Bio-Aetheric Field destabilization begins. Trained observers report "flickering aura" surrounding subject—intermittent visibility, amber-red coloration. Subject's movements become jerky, aggressive. Speech degrades to monosyllables.
>
> **T+5:00 (Peak Onset):** Full berserkergang state achieved. Subject engages training dummies with extreme force. Documented behaviors: ignoring minor injuries (laceration to forearm—no pain response), vocalizations (guttural, non-verbal), tunnel vision (fails to acknowledge observers calling name).
>
> **T+12:00 (Peak Sustained):** Subject has destroyed all available training targets. Begins circling arena perimeter. Posture: hunched, predatory. Eyes: unfocused but tracking movement. NOTE: Subject attempted to engage observation post when observer shifted position; restraint protocol activated.
>
> **T+38:00 (Crash Initiation):** Sudden cessation of aggressive behavior. Subject collapses mid-stride. Tremors visible. Shallow breathing. Bio-Aetheric Field returns to baseline (no longer visible).
>
> **T+45:00 (Post-State):** Subject regains consciousness. Reports complete memory gap from T+3:00 onward. Extreme fatigue, disorientation, emotional distress upon learning of restraint protocol activation.

**CONCLUSIONS:**
Visual documentation confirms three-phase progression (Activation → Peak → Crash). Bio-Aetheric Field instability is observable phenomenon, not merely theoretical. Post-State Amnesia is consistent across all documented cases.
