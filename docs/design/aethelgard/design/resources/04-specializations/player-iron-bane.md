# The Iron-Bane — The Zealous Purifier

> *"You see a monster. I see a machine. I see the hydraulic joints, the corrupted rune-lattice, the profane power source beating in its chest like a mockery of life. I have studied a thousand of its kind. I know where it bleeds. I know where it breaks. And I know the prayer that will unmake it. You see a monster. I see a problem with a solution."*

The **Iron-Bane** is not a mere warrior.

They are a **scholar-slayer**—a grim order dedicated to the utter extermination of the Undying.

Theirs is a crusade fueled by loss and honed by an encyclopedic, obsessive knowledge of their hated foe. From the mechanics of the "Iron Heart" to the alchemical compounds that can turn machine to rust, the Iron-Bane knows everything about their enemy. They do not fight with rage—they fight with **understanding**. Every blow is both violence and diagnosis. Every strike reveals weakness. Every prayer unmakes corruption.

To choose the Iron-Bane is to embrace the fantasy of the **ultimate monster hunter and the holy inquisitor**. Your saga is a personal crusade, a relentless and focused war against the greatest technological blasphemy of the Age of Echoes. Every battle is a righteous act of purification, and every fallen Undying is a verse in your grim hymn of vengeance.

## Core Philosophy: Knowledge is the Deadliest Weapon

### The Three Pillars

| Pillar | Mechanic | Fantasy |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Specialist Knowledge** | Undying Insight, weakness analysis | See not a monster, but a machine with exploitable flaws |
| **Righteous Purification** | Corrosive Strike, [Corroded] debuff | Unmake corrupted metal with sanctified steel and holy fire |
| **Psychic Fortress** | Indomitable Will, Heart of Iron | Mind hardened against the psychic hum of the machine-dead |

The Iron-Bane's power comes from **study, discipline, and righteous fury**—not heresy. They have spent countless hours dissecting Undying anatomy, memorizing mechanical schematics, and treating combat as applied debugging.

> *"I don't fight machines. I debug them."*

### The Coherent Path (Low Risk)

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Coherent (no Corruption mechanics) |
| **Risk Level** | Low (positive Trauma Economy interaction) |
| **Power Source** | Faith, knowledge, and disciplined fury |
| **Trade-off** | Extremely specialized—weaker against non-mechanical foes |

The Iron-Bane is a **Coherent Warrior**—one of the safest specializations in the Trauma Economy. Their power comes from resisting the Blight's effects, not channeling them. Their Vengeance resource builds from successful purification, not from taking damage or opening their minds to chaos.

Their WILL as primary attribute (unusual for Warriors) makes them a **psychic sentinel**—hardened against the terror their mechanical foes wield.

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Monster hunter; holy inquisitor; debugger of corrupted machines |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Methodical, specialized, devastatingly effective against chosen prey |
| **Success Metric** | Undying destroyed; Iron Hearts shattered; party protected from psychic assault |
| **Decision Space** | "Is this target Undying? Should I spend Vengeance now or build higher?" |

Playing an Iron-Bane is about **systematic extermination**.

Your gameplay loop:
- **Identify**: Use Undying Insight to analyze enemy weaknesses
- **Test**: Use Sanctified Steel to build Vengeance and probe defenses
- **Corrode**: Use Corrosive Strike to apply [Corroded], stripping armor
- **Execute**: Use Annihilate Iron Heart for the killing blow

Against Undying and mechanical enemies, you are a **god-tier specialist**—an unstoppable juggernaut of righteous destruction. Against other foes, you are a competent but unremarkable Warrior.

> *"The Iron-Bane feels like an unstoppable, righteous juggernaut against their chosen enemy but may feel like a more standard warrior against other foes."*

## Core Mechanics

### The Vengeance System

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Range** | 0-100 |
| **Generation** | Successful hits against Undying/Mechanical enemies |
| **Decay** | Resets to 0 when leaving combat or resting |

Vengeance is the Iron-Bane's unique resource—a measure of their righteous fury that builds through successful purification.

| Source | Vengeance Gained |
|--------|------------------|
| **Sanctified Steel vs Undying/Mechanical** | +15 per hit |
| **Sanctified Steel vs Other** | +0 (no generation) |
| **Resist psychic effect** | +10 (via Righteous Retribution) |

| Spending | Cost |
|----------|------|
| **Corrosive Strike** | 25 Vengeance |
| **Chains of Decay** | 40 Vengeance |
| **Annihilate Iron Heart** | 75 Vengeance |

> *"Unlike Fury (the heretical Berserkr resource), Vengeance is safe and coherent. No Stress penalty when generating or spending."*

### The [Corroded] Status Effect

| Property | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Application** | Corrosive Strike, Chains of Decay |
| **Effect** | Target loses Soak and resistance; takes DoT |
| **Duration** | 2-4 rounds |
| **Stacking** | Multiple applications increase severity |

The Iron-Bane's signature status effect. Sanctified steel coated with entropic compounds catalyzes a reaction in corrupted metal—rust spreads, joints seize, power conduits fail.

> *"The Iron-Bane's weapon doesn't just cut—it purifies. When it strikes Undying metal, the sanctified edge catalyzes a reaction in the corrupted alloy."*

### Psychic Resistance

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Indomitable Will I** | +1-3 dice to WILL Resolve vs [Fear] and [Psychic Static] |
| **Righteous Retribution** | 50% chance to reflect psychic effects back to caster |
| **Heart of Iron** | Permanent immunity to [Fear] |

The Iron-Bane's mind is a fortress. The psychic hum of the Jötun-Forged—the static that drives others mad—is a familiar annoyance to the Iron-Bane. Years of exposure have hardened them, and their faith provides the framework to resist what they cannot ignore.

## Abilities: The Art of the Hunt

### Tier 1 — Foundational Doctrine

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Undying Insight I** | Passive | — | +1→3 dice to WITS checks identifying Undying/Mechanical weaknesses |
| **Sanctified Steel** | Active | 40 Stamina | MIGHT melee attack; +15 Vengeance vs Undying/Mechanical |
| **Indomitable Will I** | Passive | — | +1→3 dice to WILL Resolve vs [Fear] and [Psychic Static] |

**Undying Insight I** is your foundational knowledge skill. Countless hours studying Undying anatomy translate to superior analysis. You see not a monster, but a machine with identifiable failure points.

> *"The Iron-Bane has spent countless hours studying the anatomy of the Undying. They see not a monster, but a machine."*

**Sanctified Steel** is your core attack and Vengeance builder. The blade is a sacrament—forged from pure iron, blessed by chapter priests, inscribed with prayers of purification. When it strikes corrupted metal, sparks fly from the collision of pure faith with corrupted code.

**Indomitable Will I** is your psychic firewall. Your mind is hardened by an unwavering vow of vengeance. The psychic hum that breaks others is merely background noise to you.

### Tier 2 — Advanced Extermination

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Corrosive Strike** | Active | 45 Stamina + 25 Vengeance | High damage; applies [Corroded] to Undying/Mechanical |
| **Righteous Retribution** | Passive | — | 50% chance to reflect psychic effects; +10 Vengeance on successful reflect |
| **Purging Alacrity** | Passive | — | +2 Defense for 1 round when applying [Corroded] or [Bleeding] to Undying |

**Corrosive Strike** is your armor-stripping tool. Your blade strikes with intent to unmake—coating the blow with an entropic agent that catalyzes decay in corrupted metal. The [Corroded] status strips defenses, preparing the enemy for the killing blow.

> *"The blade doesn't just cut—it purifies. Rust spreads from the wound, joints seize, power conduits fail."*

**Righteous Retribution** transforms your will from shield to mirror. When an Undying targets you with a psychic effect and you resist, there's a chance the effect reflects back onto the caster. Your faith is so strong it can weaponize the enemy's own assault.

**Purging Alacrity** rewards successful debuffing. As your foe begins to decay, you are filled with righteous speed—gaining temporary Defense as the purification takes hold.

### Tier 3 — Mastery of the Hunt

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Chains of Decay** | Active | 50 Stamina + 40 Vengeance | AoE: Moderate Physical damage to Front Row; [Corroded] to all Undying/Mechanical |
| **Heart of Iron** | Passive | — | Permanent immunity to [Fear] |

**Chains of Decay** is your AoE purification tool. You slam your weapon into the ground, unleashing a shockwave of corrosive energy that erupts in ethereal, rusting chains. All Undying in the Front Row receive [Corroded]—preparation for mass extermination.

**Heart of Iron** is the ultimate expression of your mental fortress. Your resolve becomes absolute. You gain permanent immunity to [Fear]—the primary psychological weapon of the Undying. You are an unshakeable bastion against the terror they wield.

### Capstone — Annihilate Iron Heart

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Cost** | 60 Stamina + 75 Vengeance |
| **Frequency** | Once per combat |
| **Requirement** | Target must be Undying, [Bloodied] (<50% HP), and successfully analyzed |
| **Effect** | Single-target finishing move; irresistible damage (ignores Soak/Resistance); typically instant destruction |

The capstone **Annihilate Iron Heart** is the ultimate expression of the Iron-Bane's purpose. After studying their foe, they unleash a single, perfect strike designed to shatter its profane power source.

> *"'GRIZELDA SPEAKS THE TRUE NAME OF ENDING!' Her blade pierces the Iron Hulk's core. The Iron Heart ceases to exist. The machine falls."*

The requirements are stringent—the target must be Undying, wounded, and analyzed. But when met, the result is **absolute destruction**. Irresistible damage that cannot be reduced. The Iron Heart is shattered. The corruption ends.

## Systemic Integration

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Mechanic | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Vengeance Generation** | Positive feedback—builds from resisting and purifying |
| **Psychic Resistance** | Hardened against [Fear], [Psychic Static] |
| **Reflection** | Can weaponize enemy psychic attacks |
| **No Self-Harm** | No Stress costs, no Corruption, no self-damage |

The Iron-Bane has **positive interactions** with the Trauma Economy. Their Vengeance builds from successful purification, not self-harm. Their psychic resistance makes them a natural protector for mentally fragile party members.

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Jötun-Reader** | Superior analysis helps meet Annihilate requirements; weakness identification |
| **Fragile Mystics** | Iron-Bane's psychic resistance protects vulnerable casters |
| **Berserkr** | Iron-Bane handles psychic threats; Berserkr handles organic threats |
| **Bone-Setter** | Standard healing synergy; Iron-Bane is low-maintenance |

> *"They synergize powerfully with the Jötun-Reader, whose superior analysis can help meet the stringent requirements for Annihilate Iron Heart."*

### Optimal Conditions

| Situation | Advantage |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Jötunheim biome** | God-tier; Undying everywhere |
| **Mechanical enemies** | Full kit activates; devastating effectiveness |
| **Psychic-heavy encounters** | Hardened mind protects self and party |
| **Boss fights vs Undying** | Annihilate Iron Heart ends encounters |

### Weakness Conditions

| Situation | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| **Organic enemies** | No Vengeance generation; bonus effects don't trigger |
| **Blighted Beasts** | Standard Warrior effectiveness only |
| **Humanoid rivals** | Specialized kit provides no advantage |
| **Unknown dungeon types** | Risk of low value if no Mechanical/Undying present |

## Lore Integration

### Historical Development

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| **Pre-Glitch** | Religious orders with anti-mechanical doctrine |
| **Post-Glitch Crisis** | Survivors who understood the Undying were machines |
| **Age of Echoes** | Formalized Crusade; chapter houses established |
| **Modern Practice** | Scholar-slayers embedded in expeditions as specialists |

The Iron-Bane tradition evolved from those who refused to see the Undying as invincible monsters. They recognized that machines—even corrupted ones—have weaknesses. They studied, documented, and developed systematic approaches to destruction.

### The Faith Component

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Pure Iron** | Only newly-mined iron; never salvaged alloy |
| **Sanctified Weapons** | Blessed by chapter priests; inscribed with prayers |
| **Combat as Worship** | Every blow against the Undying is an act of worship |
| **Knowledge as Sacrament** | Understanding the enemy is holy duty |

The Layer 1 practitioners describe the Iron-Bane's combat as **theological debugging**. Their faith provides the framework for understanding—the Undying are not invincible horrors but broken machines that can be shut down.

> *"'Every weakness memorized. Every failure cataloged. Holy fire cleanses corrupted iron.'"*

### Factional Relationship

| Entity | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| **Iron-Bane Crusade** | Natural alignment; many Crusade members have this specialization |
| **Non-Crusade Practitioners** | Possible—the specialization can be learned without joining the Crusade |
| **Jötun-Readers** | Respectful tension; shared enemy but different philosophies |
| **God-Sleepers** | Hostile—Iron-Banes see them as heretics who worship corruption |

**Important distinction**: The Iron-Bane *specialization* is a character build/class. The Iron-Bane *Crusade* is a faction. You can have the specialization without being a Crusade member—though the alignment is natural.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic/Theological)
*"In the hymns of the Crusade, they are the Purifiers—the grim saints who walk into the heart of corruption and emerge victorious. They do not fear the Undying. They have studied them too long, too closely, too obsessively to feel anything but cold, methodical purpose. They know the name of every joint, the function of every rune-lattice, the frequency of every psychic hum. They have prayed over a thousand Iron Hearts and watched a thousand corrupted machines fall. Their blades are sacraments. Their strikes are prayers. Their knowledge is their faith, and their faith is the deadliest weapon in Aethelgard. When the Undying march, the Iron-Bane marches to meet them—not with fear, but with the absolute certainty that machines can be shut down."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Iron-Bane (Zealous Purifier) represents the Coherent Warrior specialization optimized for anti-Undying and anti-mechanical combat. Mechanical role: hard-counter specialist with devastating effectiveness against specific enemy types. Key differentiator: WILL as primary attribute (unusual for Warriors) creates psychic sentinel role. Core mechanics: Vengeance resource (builds from successful purification), [Corroded] status effect (armor-stripping DoT), psychic resistance passives. Signature ability: Annihilate Iron Heart capstone (irresistible damage, instant kill on analyzed Undying below 50% HP). Trauma Economy interaction: Positive—Vengeance builds from success, not self-harm; psychic resistance protects party. Optimal deployment: Jötunheim biome, Undying-heavy encounters, psychic-threat scenarios. Significant weakness: dramatically reduced effectiveness against non-mechanical enemies."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Iron-Bane (Zealous Purifier). ARCHETYPE: Warrior. PATH TYPE: Coherent (Low Trauma Risk). ROLE: Specialist Hunter / Anti-Mechanical Tank / Psychic Sentinel. PRIMARY STAT: WILL. SECONDARY STAT: MIGHT. RESOURCE: Stamina + Vengeance (0-100). CORE MECHANICS: Vengeance Generation (+15 vs Undying/Mechanical, +0 vs other), [Corroded] Status (armor strip + DoT), Psychic Resistance (+dice to WILL Resolve, reflect effects, Fear immunity). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Doctrine): Undying Insight I, Sanctified Steel, Indomitable Will I. T2 (Advanced Extermination): Corrosive Strike, Righteous Retribution, Purging Alacrity. T3 (Mastery): Chains of Decay, Heart of Iron. CAPSTONE: Annihilate Iron Heart (60 Stamina + 75 Vengeance, once per combat, requires Undying + Bloodied + analyzed, irresistible damage). SYNERGIES: Jötun-Reader (analysis support), fragile Mystics (psychic protection). COUNTERS: Organic enemies, Blighted Beasts, humanoid rivals, unknown dungeon types."*

## Summary

The Iron-Bane is the **ultimate specialist** of Aethelgard.

Where other Warriors fight with rage or discipline or faith, the Iron-Bane fights with **knowledge**. They have studied the Undying obsessively—their anatomy, their weaknesses, their corrupted rune-lattices. They see not monsters but machines. And machines can be shut down.

Their WILL as primary attribute (unusual for Warriors) makes them a **psychic sentinel**—hardened against the terror their mechanical foes wield. Their Vengeance resource builds from successful purification, not self-harm or heretical bargains. Their [Corroded] status effect strips armor and prepares enemies for the killing blow.

Against Undying and mechanical enemies, they are **god-tier**. Their capstone, Annihilate Iron Heart, delivers irresistible damage that cannot be reduced—typically destroying the target instantly. In Jötunheim, they are indispensable.

Against other enemies—Blighted Beasts, rival humanoids, organic threats—they are merely a competent Warrior. Their specialized kit provides no advantage.

This is the Iron-Bane's trade-off: **absolute dominance in their domain, mediocrity outside it**. Choose them when you know what you're hunting. Choose them when the Undying march. Choose them when you need someone who can look into the heart of corrupted machinery and see exactly how to make it stop.

*You see a monster.*
*I see a machine.*
*And machines can be shut down.*
