# Two-Handed Melee Weapons

## A. Greataxes

| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Examples | Greataxe, executioner's axe, double-headed axe, Dane axe |
| Base Damage | 4d10 + MIGHT |
| Range | Melee |
| Hands Required | Two |
| Special Properties | [Brutal Critical] — Critical hits deal +2d10 additional damage |
| Proficiency Required | Axes Proficiency |
| Governing Attribute | MIGHT |

**Common Names (Layer 1):** Head-Taker, The Final Word, Giant's Tooth, Spine-Splitter

**Diagnostic Notes:** The greataxe represents maximum single-strike damage potential in the post-Glitch arsenal. The weapon's weight and leverage generate devastating force on impact; the [Brutal Critical] property reflects the catastrophic wounds inflicted when a heavy blade finds a vulnerable target. Skar-Horde Aspirants favor greataxes for their raw destructive symbolism—the weapon that ends arguments permanently.

| Example Weapon | Tier | Damage | Value (PS) | Special |
|----------------|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Lashed Scrap-Blade (Jury-Rigged) | 0 | 2d10 + MIGHT | 15 PS | Unwieldy; -1 to hit |
| Salvaged Dane Axe (Scavenged) | 1 | 4d10 + MIGHT | 75 PS | [Brutal Critical: +2d10] |
| Clan Executioner's Axe (Clan-Forged) | 2 | 4d10 + MIGHT | 280 PS | [Brutal Critical: +3d10]; intimidation bonus |

## B. Greatswords

| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Examples | Greatsword, claymore, zweihänder, bastard sword |
| Base Damage | 4d10 + MIGHT |
| Range | Melee |
| Hands Required | Two |
| Special Properties | [Sweeping Strike] — Can target two adjacent enemies with single attack (damage split) |
| Proficiency Required | Swords Proficiency |
| Governing Attribute | MIGHT |

**Common Names (Layer 1):** Giant-Killer, The Horizon-Blade, Wall-Breaker, Two-Hands' Vengeance

**Diagnostic Notes:** The greatsword sacrifices the versatility of one-handed blades for superior reach and the [Sweeping Strike] capability—the ability to engage multiple opponents simultaneously. Lex-Guardians favor greatswords for corridor combat in Scriptorium defense; the wide arc discourages flanking and controls space effectively. The weapon requires significant strength and training but rewards investment with battlefield control.

| Example Weapon | Tier | Damage | Value (PS) | Special |
|----------------|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Welded Long-Blade (Jury-Rigged) | 0 | 2d10 + MIGHT | 20 PS | Balance issues; -2 Defense |
| Salvaged Claymore (Scavenged) | 1 | 4d10 + MIGHT | 95 PS | [Sweeping Strike] |
| Hearthguard Greatsword (Clan-Forged) | 2 | 4d10 + MIGHT | 320 PS | [Sweeping Strike]; +1 Defense |
| Dvergr Zweihänder (Dvergr-Forged) | 3 | 4d10+2 + MIGHT | 580 PS | [Sweeping Strike]; parry bonus |
| Warden's Greatsword (Myth-Forged) | 5 | 5d10+4 + MIGHT | 9,500 PS | [Sweeping Strike]; ignores 50% Soak; grants [Fortified] buff |

## C. Mauls & Warhammers (Two-Handed)

| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Examples | Maul, great hammer, sledgehammer, wrecking hammer |
| Base Damage | 4d10 + MIGHT |
| Range | Melee |
| Hands Required | Two |
| Special Properties | [Armor Penetration] — Ignores 4 Soak; [Shield Breaker] — Destroys shields on critical hit |
| Proficiency Required | Hammers Proficiency |
| Governing Attribute | MIGHT |

**Common Names (Layer 1):** Structure-Ender, The Demolisher, Thunder's Echo, Bone-Dust Maker

**Diagnostic Notes:** Two-handed crushing weapons represent the apex of anti-armor capability. The [Armor Penetration] rating of 4 Soak effectively negates most conventional protection; the [Shield Breaker] property can eliminate defensive options entirely. Iron-Bane elite units wield mauls as their signature weapons—the symbolism of the hammer that shatters machines extends to the practical reality of destroying Undying automata and the armored constructs that guard high-value salvage sites.

| Example Weapon | Tier | Damage | Value (PS) | Special |
|----------------|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Pipe-Maul (Jury-Rigged) | 0 | 2d10 + MIGHT | 12 PS | Slow; -1 Initiative |
| Salvaged Sledge (Scavenged) | 1 | 4d10 + MIGHT | 65 PS | [Armor Penetration: 4 Soak] |
| Forge-Hammer (Clan-Forged) | 2 | 4d10 + MIGHT | 260 PS | [Armor Penetration: 4 Soak]; [Shield Breaker] |
| Dvergr War-Maul (Dvergr-Forged) | 3 | 4d10+3 + MIGHT | 620 PS | [Armor Penetration: 5 Soak]; [Shield Breaker]; +3 vs. Constructs |
| Jötun-Slayer (Myth-Forged) | 5 | 5d10+5 + MIGHT | 14,500 PS | [Armor Penetration: 6 Soak]; [Shield Breaker]; critical hits cause [Stunned]; ground-slam AoE |

## D. Polearms

| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Examples | Halberd, glaive, pike, atgeir, bardiche, bill hook |
| Base Damage | 3d10 + MIGHT |
| Range | Reach (can attack from Back Row) |
| Hands Required | Two |
| Special Properties | [Reach] — Can attack targets in Front Row while wielder remains in Back Row; [Set Against Charge] — +2d10 damage against charging enemies |
| Proficiency Required | Polearms Proficiency |
| Governing Attribute | MIGHT |

**Common Names (Layer 1):** Giant's Reach, The Long Death, Cavalry-Killer, Distance-Keeper

**Diagnostic Notes:** Polearms occupy a unique tactical niche—weapons that allow wielders to contribute from the protected Back Row of formation combat. The [Reach] property represents the extended striking distance; [Set Against Charge] rewards defensive positioning against aggressive enemies. The atgeir (a uniquely Aethelgardian pole-axe design) sees particular favor among Midgard Combine militia for its effectiveness against mounted raiders and large fauna.

| Example Weapon | Tier | Damage | Value (PS) | Special |
|----------------|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Sharpened Pole (Jury-Rigged) | 0 | 1d10 + MIGHT | 8 PS | Fragile; breaks on critical failure |
| Salvaged Halberd (Scavenged) | 1 | 3d10 + MIGHT | 70 PS | [Reach]; [Set Against Charge] |
| Combine Atgeir (Clan-Forged) | 2 | 3d10 + MIGHT | 240 PS | [Reach]; [Set Against Charge: +3d10]; hook for dismounting |
| Dvergr Glaive (Dvergr-Forged) | 3 | 3d10+2 + MIGHT | 480 PS | [Reach]; +2 Defense vs. charges; +2 vs. Large enemies |
| Gungnir-Pattern Pike (Myth-Forged) | 5 | 4d10+3 + MIGHT | 8,200 PS | [Reach]; [Set Against Charge: +4d10]; first strike on any approaching enemy; +3 MIGHT |

## E. Staves

| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Examples | Quarterstaff, bo staff, iron-shod staff, walking stick |
| Base Damage | 2d10 + MIGHT or WILL (wielder's choice) |
| Range | Melee |
| Hands Required | Two |
| Special Properties | [Arcane Focus] — Can serve as channeling implement for Galdr abilities; [Defensive Stance] — +1d10 to block attempts |
| Proficiency Required | Staves Proficiency (included in Simple Weapons) |
| Governing Attribute | MIGHT or WILL (wielder's choice) |

**Common Names (Layer 1):** Walking-Friend, The Traveler's Tooth, Focus-Stick, The Third Leg

**Diagnostic Notes:** The staff bridges the gap between martial and arcane—a weapon equally suited to physical combat and Galdr channeling. The dual attribute scaling (MIGHT or WILL) allows both warrior and mystic builds to employ staves effectively. Rúnasmiðr practitioners favor staves for their symbolic resonance with pre-Glitch traditions; the Scriptorium issues standardized staves to all Jötun-Reader field personnel as defensive implements.

| Example Weapon | Tier | Damage | Value (PS) | Special |
|----------------|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Wooden Staff (Jury-Rigged) | 0 | 1d10 + MIGHT/WILL | 4 PS | Basic; no special properties |
| Iron-Shod Staff (Scavenged) | 1 | 2d10 + MIGHT/WILL | 35 PS | [Defensive Stance: +1d10] |
| Rune-Marked Staff (Clan-Forged) | 2 | 2d10 + MIGHT/WILL | 180 PS | [Arcane Focus]; [Defensive Stance]; +1 WILL |
| Dvergr Warden's Staff (Dvergr-Forged) | 3 | 2d10+2 + MIGHT/WILL | 350 PS | [Arcane Focus]; [Defensive Stance: +2d10]; +2 WILL |
| All-Rune's Whisper (Myth-Forged) | 5 | 3d10+3 + MIGHT/WILL | 11,000 PS | [Arcane Focus]; reduces Galdr AP costs by 10; +4 WILL; Aether regeneration |
