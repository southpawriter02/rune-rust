# The Örlög-Bound — The Probability Steward

> *"When all others gamble, we count. When all others pray, we trim. We do not bend the will of gods—we steady the hand of the world so that what should land, lands. There is no magic here. Only arithmetic performed at the edge of what the fabric will bear."*
> — Probability Steward Eira, Scriptorium-Acolyte

The **Örlög-Bound** is not a caster of fire or a summoner of spirits.

They are a **probability steward**.

In a world running on catastrophically broken source code, the Örlög-Bound perceives the "tapestry of fate" for what it truly is: the fragmented, glitching logic of reality itself. They do not command the elements or bargain with the dead; they *nudge*. They gently adjust the variables that govern the random outcomes of existence—ensuring an ally's blow strikes true by weighting probability in their favor, or causing an enemy's attack to falter by introducing a momentary drift in their fortune.

This is a profoundly dangerous art. To interface with the fabric of causality is to risk exposure to the same recursive, anti-logical paradox that caused the Ginnungagap Glitch. Every nudge is a gamble, a potential trigger for cascade failure. Their saga is a quiet, terrifying story of trying to steady a swaying world, one careful trim at a time, while resisting being corrupted by the instability they are trying to contain.

To choose the Örlög-Bound is to embrace the fantasy of the **master of luck**, the subtle manipulator of fortune and misfortune. Your saga is written in the critical hits you enable and the catastrophic fumbles you cause.

## Core Philosophy: Stewardship of Chance

### The Art of the Nudge

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Observation, Not Command** | Read the drift before acting; name the problem before trimming |
| **Small Before Large** | Modest trims preserve fabric; grand decrees invite rebound |
| **Containment Over Spectacle** | Limit spillover; close windows; log outcomes |
| **Arithmetic, Not Magic** | Count probability like a ledger; do not chase "lucky rooms" |

The Örlög-Bound's power comes from a philosophy of **careful stewardship** rather than forceful command. Where the Galdr-Caster shouts until reality obeys and the Rust-Witch accelerates entropy, the Örlög-Bound makes small, precise adjustments to the probability distribution of events.

> *"We do not bend fate. We trim its tails. We steady its swings. We anchor its drift so that what should happen, happens—and what should not, does not."*

### The Heretical Interface

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Heretical (direct interface with corrupted causality) |
| **Risk Level** | High (Wild Magic Surge chance on every nudge) |
| **Corruption Source** | Every act of probability manipulation is an unshielded write to broken code |
| **Stress Source** | Reading the "debug log" of reality requires processing paradoxical data |

The Örlög-Bound is technically a **Heretical** specialization—not because they worship entropy or make blood sacrifices, but because their art requires a direct, unfiltered interface with the corrupted fabric of causality itself. Every nudge is a write operation to a system that has been broken since the Ginnungagap Glitch.

The corruption gain is not punishment; it is *contamination*. Each time you steady an ally's hand or fray an enemy's fortune, you expose your own probability-space to the paradoxical logic that infected the All-Rune. The Blight's recursive errors accumulate in your own threads.

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Master of luck; the one who turns fumbles into crits |
| **Gameplay Feel** | High-skill-ceiling support; subtle, strategic manipulation |
| **Success Metric** | Enabling ally success; causing enemy catastrophic failure |
| **Decision Space** | "Which outcome do I nudge, and can I contain the rebound?" |

Playing an Örlög-Bound is about **reading the battlefield and choosing which dice rolls matter most**.

Your gameplay loop:
- **Observe**: Read the probability drift—where is variance dangerous?
- **Announce**: Declare your nudge window and direction (steady ally, fray foe)
- **Anchor**: Pair your nudge to a stable anchor (tank wall, controller line)
- **Nudge**: Apply your trim—bonus dice, penalty dice, forced re-roll
- **Contain**: Close the window, manage surge risk, log the outcome

You are not a damage dealer. You are not a healer. You are the **reliability engine**—the one who raises the floor for allies and lowers the ceiling for enemies at critical moments.

> *"The Örlög-Bound makes the entire party more effective and their enemies more prone to spectacular failure by controlling the very mathematics of the game."*

## Core Mechanics

### Probability Manipulation

| Type | Name | Effect |
|------|------|--------|
| **Additive (Buff)** | Guiding Thread | Add bonus dice to ally's next roll |
| **Additive (Debuff)** | Fraying Thread | Remove dice from enemy's rolls |
| **Re-deterministic** | Fated Intervention | Force a re-roll of completed result |
| **Deterministic** | Destiny's Decree | Choose the outcome of any roll |

The **Probability Manipulation** mechanic is the Örlög-Bound's defining feature. Their abilities directly influence the dice pool system that governs all actions in combat.

| Manipulation Level | Power | Risk |
|--------------------|-------|------|
| **Additive** | Moderate (±1-2 dice) | Low surge chance |
| **Re-deterministic** | High (invalidate bad outcome) | Medium surge chance |
| **Deterministic** | Absolute (choose result) | Very high surge + Corruption |

This is not spellcasting in the traditional sense. This is **writing to the corrupted source code of reality**—adjusting variables, trimming probability tails, and hoping the system doesn't crash.

### The Inevitable Glitch

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Function** | Every probability manipulation has a chance to trigger Wild Magic Surge |
| **Trigger** | Baseline chance on all nudges; higher for powerful abilities |
| **Effect** | Random system error—could help, could harm, could cascade |
| **Mitigation** | Embrace the Glitch passive improves surge outcomes |

The **Inevitable Glitch** mechanic is the core risk of the Örlög-Bound. Meddling with the source code of causality is inherently unstable.

> *"Every nudge is a potential trigger for a bigger system error. Their gameplay is a constant tension between the desire for a perfect outcome and the risk of causing an even greater system crash."*

An attempt to bless an ally could accidentally curse them. A forced re-roll could trigger a cascade failure. The Örlög-Bound lives on the knife's edge between brilliant manipulation and catastrophic backfire.

### Probability Stewardship Protocol

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1. **Observation** | Identify keystones and live tests where trim matters more than force |
| 2. **Announcement** | State the window and direction of nudge; crew anchors around the window |
| 3. **Anchoring** | Pair nudges to stable anchors (Skjaldmær wall, Atgeir crown, Hlekkr line) |
| 4. **Nudge** | Apply trim—steady ally or fray foe; prefer small trims to grand decrees |
| 5. **Containment** | Hold surge-catch draughts; close window on count; do not stack nudges |
| 6. **Logging** | Record window length, anchor used, observed effect, surge/backfire |

This is the Reader-codified protocol for safe probability work. It is not mystical ritual—it is **clinical hygiene** for operating at the edge of chance.

## Abilities: The Threads of Causality

### Tier 1 — Foundational Weaving

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Code-Sense I** | Passive | — | Bonus die to WITS checks for magical auras and environmental glitches; introduces Fickle Power |
| **Guiding Thread** | Active | 30 AP | Apply buff to ally: +2 dice to their next roll; inflicts small Corruption |
| **Fraying Thread** | Active | 35 AP | Apply debuff to enemy: -1 die to all rolls for 2 rounds |

**Code-Sense I** is the perceptual foundation. The Örlög-Bound possesses an innate, almost unsettling intuition for the flow of probability. They can perceive the faint shimmer of drift around people and objects—seeing where fortune has knotted or thinned. This passive also introduces the **Fickle Power** mechanic: the baseline Wild Magic Surge risk on all abilities.

**Guiding Thread** is the core ally buff. You gently nudge the probability space surrounding an ally, weighting the system's outcomes in their favor. For a moment, their movements become impossibly precise.

> *"A shimmer of pure, coherent logic briefly surrounds them."*

**Fraying Thread** is the core enemy debuff. You find a thread of misfortune in an enemy's probability space and snag it, introducing drift. The enemy becomes clumsy, their actions slightly off-balance as their fortune momentarily destabilizes.

### Tier 2 — Advanced Stewardship

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Scry the Debug Log** | Active | 40 AP | WILL check to reveal one enemy Resistance or Vulnerability; inflicts Psychic Stress |
| **Fated Intervention** | Reaction | 30 AP | Force re-roll when ally suffers Critical Hit or Fumble; high surge chance |
| **Embrace the Glitch** | Passive | — | Increased surge chance, but surges more likely to have positive outcomes |

**Scry the Debug Log** is the divination ability. You close your eyes and focus your inner sight, perceiving the tangled threads surrounding a foe. You read their cached probability—seeing the exploitable weaknesses in their fortune. This direct processing of paradoxical data inflicts **Psychic Stress**.

> *"The Örlög-Bound reads reality's cached data and predictive algorithms, revealing an enemy's 'fated' vulnerabilities."*

**Fated Intervention** is the emergency save. As a disastrous outcome is about to land, you intervene directly, injecting a last-second correction to force a re-roll. The ally must accept the second result—but it might be better. This forced intervention has a high chance of triggering a **Wild Magic Surge**.

**Embrace the Glitch** represents mastery of instability. You become so accustomed to the world's chaos that you learn to ride its waves. A potential system error becomes an opportunity. Your surge chance increases—but when surges occur, they're more likely to benefit the party.

### Tier 3 — Mastery of Causality

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Sever the Subroutine** | Active | 50 AP | Attempt to dispel one magical buff from enemy; opposed WILL check; inflicts Corruption |
| **Cascade Failure** | Active | 60 AP | For 2 rounds, all enemies have increased Fumble range (Botch on 1 or 2) |

**Sever the Subroutine** is the dispel. You target a beneficial effect on an enemy and find the temporary thread that sustains it. With a sharp, mental `DELETE` command, you snap the thread, causing the magic to instantly unravel.

> *"This is not a counter-spell but an act of logical deletion."*

**Cascade Failure** is the AoE debuff. You extend your influence over the battlefield, injecting drift and minor paradoxes into the action-space of all foes. For a short time, every action the enemy takes is fraught with potential for catastrophic failure. Their Fumble range expands dramatically.

### Capstone — Destiny's Decree

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Cost** | 85 AP |
| **Chant** | 1 Turn |
| **Frequency** | Once per combat |
| **Effect** | Target any single dice roll (ally or enemy) and **choose the result** |
| **Backlash** | Massive, irresistible Corruption + Psychic Stress |

The capstone **Destiny's Decree** is the ultimate expression of probability manipulation. The Örlög-Bound ceases to merely influence causality and, for one brief, shining moment, **directly rewrites it**.

> *"They reach into the source code of a single event and issue an undeniable SET command, forcing a moment of absolute, user-defined certainty in a world of chaos."*

You can turn a devastating enemy Critical Hit into a Fumble. You can ensure an ally's desperate last-ditch attack is a perfect Critical Success. You can choose.

The cost is brutal: this profound violation of the world's broken rules is a direct interface with the All-Rune's paradox, inflicting massive, irresistible **Psychic Stress** and **Runic Blight Corruption**.

## Systemic Integration

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Source | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Guiding Thread** | Small Corruption per use (write operation to corrupted code) |
| **Scry the Debug Log** | Moderate Psychic Stress (processing paradoxical data) |
| **Sever the Subroutine** | Moderate Corruption (deletion operation) |
| **Fated Intervention** | Surge risk (forced re-write of completed outcome) |
| **Destiny's Decree** | Massive Corruption + Stress (direct rewrite of reality) |

The Örlög-Bound accumulates **both Corruption and Psychic Stress** through normal gameplay. Their divination causes Stress; their manipulation causes Corruption; their surges cause chaos.

### Mitigation Tools

| Tool | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Embrace the Glitch** | Converts surge outcomes toward positive results |
| **Anchoring** | Pair nudges to stable party members to contain spillover |
| **Window Discipline** | Close nudge windows promptly; don't stack without reset |
| **Surge-Catch Draughts** | Bone-Setter custody; emergency containment for rebound signs |

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Berserkr** | Guiding Thread ensures massive, low-accuracy swings land |
| **Skjaldmær** | Tank wall provides stable anchor for nudge containment |
| **Hlekkr-master** | Controller line creates anchor points for probability work |
| **Atgeir-Wielder** | Reach crown provides decisive moment for steadying |
| **Skald** | Cadence plus field trim prevents panic stampede |

> *"With walls, reach, and leash, the Örlög-Bound converts slim chances into steady outcomes without spectacle."*

The Örlög-Bound has incredible synergy with **high-risk, high-reward builds**. They can ensure a Berserkr's reckless swing connects, or make a glass cannon enemy a liability to itself through Cascade Failure.

### Counter-Synergies

| Situation | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| **No stable anchors** | Without tanks/controllers, nudges have higher spillover risk |
| **Surge-heavy environment** | Areas with existing instability compound backfire chance |
| **Anti-magic enemies** | Dispel-resistant targets ignore Sever the Subroutine |
| **Short fights** | Subtle manipulation requires time to compound advantage |

## Lore Integration

### Historical Development

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| **Pre-Glitch** | Probability-readers existed but operated with stable systems |
| **Early Post-Glitch** | "Luck-workers" chased spectacle; invited cascades |
| **Reader Codification** | Scriptorium moved the craft to clinical stewardship protocol |
| **Modern Practice** | Observe → Announce → Anchor → Nudge → Contain → Log |

The Örlög-Bound tradition evolved from early post-Glitch luck-workers who sought to manipulate fortune for personal gain. These gamblers and tricksters invited catastrophic cascades through reckless probability manipulation.

The Jötun-Reader Scriptorium codified the practice into **probability stewardship**—a clinical, documented approach to trimming outcome distributions safely. The Alfrune Lexicon standardized terminology (Skewed Hand, Brittle Luck, Fumble Bloom) and safe trim protocols.

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Jötun-Readers** | Developed and govern the discipline; custody of kit and protocol |
| **Bone-Setters** | Provide surge-catch draughts and coherence medicine for rebound |
| **Kaupmaðr** | Log kits and windows to prevent market manipulation and rumor spirals |
| **Iron-Banes** | Deeply suspicious; probability manipulation smells of corruption |
| **Dvergr** | Distrustful; prefer physics to fate-work |

The Jötun-Readers consider probability stewardship a legitimate subdiscipline of their diagnostic tradition. The Bone-Setters provide medical support for practitioners experiencing rebound. The Kaupmaðr merchant guilds maintain custody logs to prevent probability workers from manipulating markets.

### Common Drifts and Trims

| Drift | Symptom | Trim |
|-------|---------|------|
| **Skewed Hand** | Ally outcomes swing too wide | Steady one decisive act per span |
| **Brittle Luck** | Foe enjoys outlier success runs | Narrow their success window |
| **Fumble Bloom** | Field jitters widen crowd error | Pair Skald cadence with field trim |
| **Hollow Strike** | Physical counters don't bind (Undying) | Anchor trim to Hlekkr displacement |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the songs, they are the fate-spinners, the luck-weavers, the ones who stand at the loom of destiny and adjust the threads with fingers that barely touch. They do not cast lightning or call fire—they simply ensure that when the warrior swings, the blade finds flesh. When the enemy lunges, the foot slips. When the desperate gamble is thrown, the dice fall true. They are the quiet terror of the sagas—the proof that the smallest adjustment at the right moment can change everything. Heroes pray for their blessing. Villains fear their attention. And the world, spinning on its broken axis, bends ever so slightly toward the outcomes they prefer."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Örlög-Bound (Probability Steward) represents the Heretical Mystic specialization optimized for support and probability manipulation. Mechanical role: high-skill-ceiling support controller affecting dice pool outcomes. Key differentiator: directly manipulates success/failure rates rather than dealing damage or healing. Core mechanic: Probability Manipulation (additive, re-deterministic, and deterministic types). Signature ability: Destiny's Decree (choose any roll's outcome, massive trauma cost). Trauma Economy interaction: High risk—Corruption from every manipulation write; Psychic Stress from divination reads; Wild Magic Surge chance on all abilities. Optimal deployment: parties with high-risk damage dealers, critical encounter moments, long fights where probability compounding matters. Requires stable anchors (tanks, controllers) for safe nudge containment."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Örlög-Bound (Probability Steward). ARCHETYPE: Mystic. PATH TYPE: Heretical (Controlled Risk). ROLE: Support Controller / Probability Manipulator / Reality Debugger. PRIMARY STAT: WILL. SECONDARY STAT: WITS. RESOURCE: Aether Pool. CORE MECHANICS: Probability Manipulation (Additive/Re-deterministic/Deterministic), The Inevitable Glitch (baseline surge chance), Probability Stewardship Protocol (observe→announce→anchor→nudge→contain→log). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Weaving): Code-Sense I, Guiding Thread, Fraying Thread. T2 (Advanced Stewardship): Scry the Debug Log, Fated Intervention, Embrace the Glitch. T3 (Mastery of Causality): Sever the Subroutine, Cascade Failure. CAPSTONE: Destiny's Decree (85 AP, 1-turn chant, choose any roll result, massive Corruption/Stress). SYNERGIES: Berserkr (ensure swings land), Skjaldmær (anchor containment), Hlekkr-master (displacement anchor), Skald (panic prevention). COUNTERS: No stable anchors, surge-heavy environments, dispel-resistant targets, short fights."*

## Summary

The Örlög-Bound is the **probability steward** of Aethelgard.

Where others deal damage or heal wounds, the Örlög-Bound adjusts the mathematics of the game itself. They add dice to ally rolls. They remove dice from enemy rolls. They force re-rolls of catastrophic outcomes. And at the pinnacle of their power, they simply choose what the dice say.

Their power is subtle but profound. A Guiding Thread at the right moment turns a near-miss into a killing blow. A Fraying Thread makes an elite enemy fumble at a critical moment. A Fated Intervention saves a life that should have been lost. A Destiny's Decree rewrites fate itself.

But every nudge is a write operation to corrupted code. The Wild Magic Surge mechanic means that any manipulation could backfire. The Trauma Economy punishes constant use—Corruption accumulates from manipulation, Psychic Stress accumulates from divination.

The Örlög-Bound requires discipline, anchoring, and containment. They are not a solo act—they are a **force multiplier** who makes the entire party more reliable and the enemies more prone to spectacular failure.

Their protocol is clinical: Observe. Announce. Anchor. Nudge. Contain. Log.

*They do not bend fate.*
*They trim its tails.*
*They steady its swings.*
*And for those who stand beside them, fortune favors the prepared.*
