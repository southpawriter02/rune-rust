Ash-Crow
"First thing the children learn: when the sky screams, the ground listens. You hear that shrieking—that metal-on-metal sound they make—you don't look up. You look down. You feel the ground with your feet. Because those birds, they're not hunting you. They're hunting for something else. The Wyrms. The things that move beneath the ash."
— Elder Björn Ash-Walker, Hearth-Clan of the Ember Vents, 780 PG

2. Lineage & Origin (Domain 5 Compliance)
2.1 Pre-Glitch Baseline
Property
Value
Baseline Species
Common Corvid (specific bio-asset designation unconfirmed)
Original Function
No engineered function; natural fauna present in pre-Glitch ecosystems
Era of Origin
Pre-Glitch natural population; mutagenesis during Age of Echoes
2.2 Mutation Vector
Vector
Description
Primary Cause
Multi-generational exposure to Surtr Forge toxic ashfall saturated with raw Aetheric residue following the Great Ashfall; evolutionary pressure selecting for ash-retention and weaponization capabilities
Visible Mutations
Feathers perpetually caked in grey-to-rust toxic ash; base plumage matte black with blue-green iridescent sheen (visible only when ash coating minimal); individual barbs frayed from corrosive exposure; beak and talons mineral-hardened (darker, more rigid than baseline corvid); eyes amber-to-red; body density increased from mineral absorption
Behavioral Changes
Evolved coordinated flock hunting with acoustic deception tactics; developed symbiotic predation relationship with Ash-Wyrms; weaponized environmental ash into corrosive plume deployment
Domain 5 Note: The Ash-Crow is not an engineered species but a natural corvid line profoundly mutated by the Ashfall Drifts' toxic environment. Unlike the Skrap-Troll's corrupted maintenance protocols, the Ash-Crow represents organic adaptation to catastrophic environmental change—a creature that has learned to weaponize the very poison saturating its world.

Damage
1d4 + 1 — Tier: Light d4
Effects
Wounds carry elevated sepsis risk; on critical hit, target gains [Infected] (DC 10 MIGHT save at end of each rest or take 1d4 damage)
Resolution: Roll AGILITY d10 vs target Physical Defense DC
4.2 Special Abilities
Corrosive Ash Plume (Active — Flock Ability)
Property
Value
Type
Active
Trigger
Standard action; requires 3+ Ash-Crows in adjacent positions
Effect
Synchronized ash-shaking releases dense corrosive cloud in 2-zone radius. All creatures in area: DC 12 AGILITY save or [Blinded] for 1d4+1 rounds (8-15 minutes narrative time); DC 10 Physical save or take 1d6 Acid damage from chemical burns; DC 10 WILL save or suffer 1 Psychic Stress (cumulative with prolonged exposure)
Cooldown
3 rounds
Aetheric Grounding (Domain 3): The ash coating carries low-level Runic Blight signature (H-Index 1.8). Forensic analysis confirms pH 3.2-4.1, containing crystalline silicates (47%), calcium sulfate derivatives (23%), trace heavy metals (18%), and unidentified organic compounds (12%). The exothermic reaction with moisture explains chemical burn mechanics.
Sonic Maelstrom (Passive — Flock Ability)
Property
Value
Type
Passive
Trigger
When 6+ Ash-Crows are present and actively vocalizing
Effect
Harsh metallic cawing (2-4 kHz) creates disorienting auditory environment. All non-Ash-Crow creatures in encounter: -1 penalty to Perception checks; cannot detect approaching creatures using auditory cues alone; advantage on Stealth checks for Ash-Wyrms in same encounter
Cooldown
None (sustained while flock present)
Aetheric Grounding (Domain 3): Unlike the silence doctrine of the Ash-Vargr, Ash-Crows leverage noiseas deception. Bio-Aetheric field resonance enables flock coordination, allowing synchronized displays without visible communication cues.
Vanguard Signal (Passive — Environmental Trigger)
Property
Value
Type
Passive
Trigger
When Ash-Crow flock maintains circling pattern above target location for 2+ rounds after initial assault
Effect
Indicates Ash-Wyrm approach (10-20 minute narrative window). Flock transitions to observation pattern; GM should prepare Ash-Wyrm encounter or provide escape opportunity
Cooldown
None
Aetheric Grounding (Domain 3): The symbiotic predation relationship sees Ash-Crows act as "eyes and ears" for subterranean Ash-Wyrms. Dense flock territories correlate with known Wyrm migratory paths; flock agitation precedes Wyrm surface activity by 10-20 minutes.
Diving Assault (Active — Individual)
Property
Value
Type
Active
Trigger
Standard action; must begin turn 2+ zones above target
Effect
Ash-Crow dives 3 zones and makes Rending Talons attack with advantage. On hit, target must pass DC 10 AGILITY save or be [Disoriented] until end of next turn (disadvantage on attacks)
Cooldown
2 rounds
Aetheric Grounding (Domain 3): Coordinated diving attacks target head and eyes, exploiting the disorientation caused by the Sonic Maelstrom to strike vulnerable areas.
4.3 Signature Ability (Large Flock/Swarm Only)
Property
Value
Name
Rolling Ash Wave
Type
Major action
Effect
The flock executes synchronized ash-shaking in cascading waves, creating a rolling corrosive cloud that moves through a 4-zone line. All creatures in the line take 2d6 Acid damage (DC 14 AGILITY save for half) and must pass DC 12 WILL save or gain 2 Psychic Stress. [Blinded] effect automatic (no save) for 2d4 rounds. Cloud persists for 1 round as difficult terrain (1d4 Acid damage on entry)
Limitations
Once per encounter; requires 13+ Ash-Crows; depletes ash coating (flock cannot use Corrosive Ash Plume for 5 rounds)

5.2 Tactical Notes
Situation
Behavior
Opening
Establishes circling pattern at 40-80m altitude; scouts observe target movement patterns; occasional cawing to assess reaction
Grouped Targets
Focuses harassment on isolated or lagging individuals; uses Sonic Maelstrom to mask approach; deploys ash plume to separate targets
Wounded Flock
If flock reduced below 6, survivors retreat to nest site or Wyrm territory; will not pursue beyond territorial range
Wyrm Coordination
If Ash-Wyrm present, flock maintains constant vocalization to mask Wyrm vibrations; focuses on blinding and disorienting targets for Wyrm ambush
5.3 Environmental Use
Element
Usage
Terrain
Uses dust storms and low visibility to mask flock size; attacks from unexpected angles through ash clouds
Ambush
Positions on gantries, ruins, and geothermal vents; uses thermal updrafts for energy-efficient circling
Nest Sites
Nests in elevated positions near Surtr Forge peripheries; +2 effective flock size when defending nest within 50m
Altitude
Exploits vertical space; difficult for ground-based parties to engage without ranged weapons

6.2 Synergies
Paired With
Synergy Effect
Ash-Wyrm
Primary symbiotic partner; Crows provide acoustic cover and target designation; Wyrm provides scraps for feeding
Borealis Storm
Mass migration behavior; environmental chaos compounds flock threat; reduced visibility enables ambush
Geothermal Vents
Elevated aggression near high Aetheric flux zones; thermal updrafts enhance mobility
Ash-Vargr
Contrasting tactics (silence vs. noise) create layered threat; Vargr approach masked by Crow cacophony
6.3 Counter-Play
Method
Effectiveness
Forge-Echo Air Filter
Negates respiratory damage from ash plume; mandatory equipment in Ash-Crow territory
Sealed Eye Protection
Reduces [Blinded] duration by half; advantage on saves vs. Corrosive Ash Plume
Directional Acoustic Dampeners
Creates silence pockets disrupting flock coordination; Sonic Maelstrom negated in affected area
Controlled Directional Flares
Fire Giant's Breath at 45° angles disperses flock without attracting Wyrm attention
Alkaline Solution (Surtr's Eye-Wash)
Neutralizes chemical burns; removes [Blinded] if applied within 15 minutes
Covered Terrain
Overhangs, ruins, crevasses limit aerial attack angles; forces flock to ground engagement
Area-of-Effect Cold Damage
Exploits cold vulnerability; Niflheim-sourced weapons highly effective

9. Voice Guidance
9.1 Description Templates (Narrator Voice)
First Sighting:
"The sky screams. Distant at first—a metallic shriek like iron scraping iron—but growing, layering, until the sound becomes a wall. Through the perpetual haze of the Ashfall Drifts, shapes wheel against the rust-colored sky: ragged black forms, their feathers trailing grey-rust dust like smoke. The flock circles, patient, watching. Waiting. The Hearth-Clans have a saying: 'When the sky screams, the ground listens.' You would be wise to remember why."
In Combat:
"The flock descends in shrieking waves, their synchronized shaking releasing a rolling cloud of corrosive ash that burns eyes and claws at lungs. The acrid-metallic stench is overwhelming. Through streaming tears, you see talons flash—mineral-hardened, darker than any natural claw. The birds do not fight with fury. They fight with patience. They are not trying to kill you. They are trying to blind you for what comes next."
Death (Individual):
"The Ash-Crow tumbles from the sky, trailing a final plume of grey-rust dust. It strikes the ground with a wet thud, feathers splaying like broken fingers. For a moment, the toxic ash coating shimmers with a faint, sickly luminescence—the residual Blight-signature bleeding away. Then nothing. Just another corpse for the Drifts to claim."
Vanguard Signal:
"The surviving Crows do not flee. They rise, circling, their shrieks shifting to a lower, rhythmic cadence—almost a chant. They are watching you now with unsettling focus, maintaining their pattern above your position. The ground beneath your feet feels... different. Unstable. The Hearth-Clans teach that this is the moment you run. The Crows are no longer hunting for themselves. They are marking you for something larger. Something beneath the ash."

2025-12-29
Initial specification. Synthesized from v2.0, v3.0, v4.0, and v5.0 source materials. Ash-Crow designed as flock-based minion threat emphasizing Muspelheim's Ashfall Drifts ecology. Core mechanics: Corrosive Ash Plume (area denial, [Blinded], Acid damage), Sonic Maelstrom (perception penalty, acoustic camouflage), Vanguard Signal (Ash-Wyrm coordination trigger). Four-stage threat ladder validated: Observation → Harassment → Assault → Vanguard. Flock scaling from Minion (3-6) to Boss-equivalent Swarm (21-40). Symbiotic predation with Ash-Wyrms documented as primary encounter escalation path. Counter-play via Forge-Echo Air Filters, acoustic dampeners, alkaline solutions, covered terrain. Four variants defined: Matriarch (Elite, flock command), Forge-Touched (Blight-saturated, enhanced Psychic Stress), Juvenile (minion-lite, reduced abilities), Clamor-Crow (acoustic specialist). Voice guidance aligned with Domain 4 vocabulary rules. Cross-linked to Ash-Wyrm, Muspelheim Ashfall Drifts, Forge-Echo Air Filter, Surtr's Eye-Wash.
