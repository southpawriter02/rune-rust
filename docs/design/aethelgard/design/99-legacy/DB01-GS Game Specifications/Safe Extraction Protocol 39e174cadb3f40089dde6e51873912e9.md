## Thematic Description

> *"When everything goes wrong, you get everyone out. Your routes are planned, your signals clear, your discipline absolute."*
> 

The Safe Extraction Protocol is the Ruin-Stalker's **emergency response**. When anomalies cascade, traps trigger, or CPS accumulates beyond safe thresholds, you activate pre-planned extraction routes that get the entire party to safety. Your preparation is their survival.

## Mechanical Implementation

### Base Effect (Rank 1)

- **Cost**: 40 Stamina
- **Trigger**: Declare extraction
- **Duration**: Until party exits current zone or 5 rounds (whichever first)
- **Party Benefits**:
    - +3d10 to all movement and hazard avoidance checks
    - **Immunity** to opportunity attacks from environmental hazards
    - Movement speed **+50%** toward exit

### Rank 2

- **Soak Bonus**: Party also gains **+2 Soak**
- **Rally Points**: Designate points where party regains **10 Stamina**
- **PP Cost**: 5

### Rank 3

- **CPS Immunity**: Party gains temporary **immunity to CPS progression**
- **Carry**: Can carry one **incapacitated ally** at full speed
- **Unstoppable**: Extraction cannot be interrupted by non-boss enemies
- **PP Cost**: 5

## Extraction Triggers

When to activate Safe Extraction Protocol:

| Trigger | Severity | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPS Stage 2 symptoms | High | Immediate extraction |
| Multiple trap triggers | Moderate | Consider extraction |
| Party below 50% HP | Moderate | Consider extraction |
| Lethal anomaly detected | Critical | Immediate extraction |
| Party member incapacitated | Critical | Immediate extraction |

---

## Rally Points (Rank 2+)

- Designated during extraction
- Party members reaching rally point regain **10 Stamina**
- Can designate **one rally point per room/corridor**
- Rally points must be on extraction route

---

## Synergies

### Internal (Ruin-Stalker Tree)

- **Hazard Mapping**: Pre-mapped routes enable faster extraction
- **Careful Advance**: Extraction uses your movement expertise
- **CPS Resistance**: Rank 3 extends your CPS protection to party

### External (Party Composition)

- **Heavy armor users**: +50% speed crucial for slow movers
- **Wounded parties**: Soak bonus (Rank 2) provides survival buffer
- **Incapacitated allies**: Rank 3 carry ensures no one left behind

---

## Tactical Applications

### Pre-Planning

1. Map extraction routes during initial survey
2. Identify rally points in each area
3. Establish visual/auditory extraction signals
4. Brief party on extraction protocol

### Emergency Execution

1. Declare extraction (Full Turn action)
2. All party members begin moving toward exit
3. Use rally points to recover Stamina
4. Maintain discipline until zone exit
