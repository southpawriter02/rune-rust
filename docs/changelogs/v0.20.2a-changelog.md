# v0.20.2a Changelog — Rúnasmiðr Framework (Tier 1)

## Added

### Domain Layer
- **`RuneType` enum** — 5 rune inscription types (Enhancement, Protection, Elemental, Ward, Trap)
- **`RunasmidrAbilityId` enum** — 9 abilities across 4 tiers (T1: InscribeRune, ReadTheMarks, RunestoneWard; T2: EmpoweredInscription, RunicTrap, DvergrTechniques; T3: MasterScrivener, LivingRunes; Capstone: WordOfUnmaking)
- **`RuneChargeResource` value object** — Max 5 charges, crafting-based generation (1 for standard, 2 for complex), rest restoration, atomic spend/affordability checks
- **`InscribedRune` value object** — Temporary equipment enhancement with tick-based duration (10 turns default, +2 weapon damage or +1 armor Defense)
- **`RunestoneWard` value object** — Damage-absorbing ward (10 HP default) with overflow mechanics and visual bar display

### Application Layer
- **`IRuneChargeService` interface** — Contract for Rune Charge resource management (spend, generate, restore, affordability)
- **`RuneChargeService` implementation** — Logging-wrapped operations on RuneChargeResource with structured Serilog logging
- **`IRunasmidrAbilityService` interface** — Contract for Tier 1 ability execution and PP tier unlock checks
- **`RunasmidrAbilityService` implementation** — Full Tier 1 ability execution with validation pipeline (specialization, ability unlock, AP, charges)

### Player Entity Extensions
- `RuneCharges` property (nullable, for Rúnasmiðr players)
- `ActiveWard` property for Runestone Ward
- `ActiveRunes` read-only list for inscribed runes
- `UnlockedRunasmidrAbilities` read-only set
- `InitializeRuneCharges()`, `HasRunasmidrAbilityUnlocked()`, `UnlockRunasmidrAbility()`
- `AddInscribedRune()`, `RemoveInscribedRune()`, `SetActiveWard()`
- `GetRunasmidrPPInvested()` with tier-based PP cost calculation

### Configuration
- **`config/specializations.json`** — New config file with Rúnasmiðr entry (resource definitions, tier structure, PP requirements)
- **`config/abilities.json`** — Added 3 Tier 1 abilities: inscribe-rune, read-the-marks, runestone-ward

### Unit Tests
- **`RuneChargeResourceTests`** — 14 tests covering initialization, spending, crafting generation, restoration, affordability, percentage, modification tracking
- **`RunasmidrAbilityServiceTests`** — 15 tests covering Inscribe Rune (weapon/armor/insufficient charges/AP/ability/spec), Runestone Ward (creation/replacement/charges), PP investment and tier unlock checks

## Notes
- Follows all established patterns from Skjaldmær specialization (BlockChargeResource, BlockChargeService, SkjaldmaerAbilityService)
- Read the Marks passive ability is a framework marker; actual Perception/Lore integration is a future integration point
- Pre-existing build error in `Room.cs` (duplicate `Position` property) continues to block test execution; not introduced by this version
