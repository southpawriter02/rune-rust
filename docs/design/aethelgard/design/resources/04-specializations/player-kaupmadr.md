# The Kaupmaðr — The Broker of Coherence

> *"You see a pile of salvage. I see three months of food for a hold. You see a hostile gate. I see a tariff negotiation waiting to happen. You see an enemy with a blade. I see a man with debts, fears, and a price. Everything has a price in the Age of Echoes—the trick is knowing when to name it, and when to let them name it first. Appraise first. Promise last. Leave room for tomorrow's handshake."*
> — Haldr Silver-Tongue, Master Kaupmaðr, founding member of the Grey Blades Arbitration Guild

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Adept |
| **Role** | Economic Specialist, Trauma Broker, Social Navigator |
| **Path Type** | Coherent |
| **Primary Attribute** | WITS |
| **Secondary Attribute** | WILL |
| **Resource System** | Stamina |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | Low |
| **Unlock Cost** | 10 PP |

The **Kaupmaðr** (Merchant-Venturer) is not a fighter.

They are a **broker of coherence**.

In a reality shattered by the Runic Blight, the Kaupmaðr is a silver-tongued survivor who understands the world's new, grim currency. They are masters of the deal in a world where a rare, uncorrupted schematic is worth more than a chieftain's ransom, and where the most valuable commodity of all is a moment of clarity in a sea of madness.

Their expertise lies not in combat or crafting, but in **appraisal, negotiation, and the navigation of the Trauma Economy itself**. They see value where others see junk. They see opportunity where others see conflict. They see the price of everything—including sanity.

To choose the Kaupmaðr is to embrace the fantasy of the **master merchant and social engineer**. Your saga is not written in blood, but in Data-Shards. You are a trailblazer of a new world, risking life and sanity to reconnect the scattered embers of civilization through trade, proving that the sharpest weapon is not a blade, but a well-structured contract.

## Core Philosophy: The Economics of a Corrupted World

### The Three Pillars

| Pillar | Mechanic | Fantasy |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Economic Supremacy** | Eye for Value, Shrewd Appraisal, Haggler's Tongue | See profit where others see rubble; master of every transaction |
| **Trauma Economy Manipulation** | Trauma Broker, Investment, Trade Routes | Broker of sanity; literally heal the world through commerce |
| **Pragmatic Combat** | Improvised Bludgeon, Pocket Sand, Art of the Deal | Dirty fighter who ends battles with bribes, not blades |

The Kaupmaðr's power comes from a philosophy of **coherence as currency**. In a world where the Runic Blight has shattered economies and erased trust, the Kaupmaðr rebuilds both—one deal at a time.

They do not fear the broken world. They have learned that broken things have value. Salvage has value. Information has value. Safe passage has value. Even sanity—especially sanity—has a price.

> *"Value is a pattern, not a price. The Kaupmaðr converts scattered salvage and fragile trust into seasonal stability."*

### The Coherent Adept (Low Risk)

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Coherent (no Corruption mechanics) |
| **Risk Level** | Low (safest Adept specialization after Einbúi) |
| **Power Source** | Knowledge, reputation, and social acumen |
| **Trade-off** | Minimal direct combat contribution |

The Kaupmaðr is a **Coherent specialization**—one of the safest in the Trauma Economy. They have no self-harm mechanics, no Corruption costs from their abilities, no deliberate interface with the Blight's chaos.

Their only Trauma Economy exposure comes from appraising [Glitched] items—looking too closely at corrupted artifacts inflicts minor Psychic Stress as the Blight's logic-corruption whispers at the edges of perception. But this is a choice, not a requirement.

Their WITS as primary attribute makes them excellent at analysis, appraisal, and spotting hidden value. Their WILL as secondary gives them the force of personality required for persuasion, intimidation, and negotiation.

> *"The Kaupmaðr is relatively safe from the Trauma Economy. Their primary risk is the Psychic Stress gained from appraising [Glitched] items or from the tension of a high-stakes, failed negotiation."*

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Master merchant; social engineer; the one who always has leverage |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Economic support with unconventional combat options |
| **Success Metric** | Party wealth; deals closed; fights avoided; world improved |
| **Decision Space** | "What's this worth? Who's the buyer? What's their price?" |

Playing a Kaupmaðr is about **seeing value everywhere and leveraging it**.

Your gameplay loop:
- **Appraise**: Identify the true worth of salvage, including hidden corruption
- **Negotiate**: Get better prices, unlock secret stock, establish relationships
- **Invest**: Spend wealth to permanently improve settlements and vendors
- **Broker**: Use your connections to access sanity-mending goods and safe passage
- **Improvise**: When words fail, fight dirty—or just bribe them

You are a unique support class whose power is felt most keenly *between* the fights. You are the economic engine of the party, ensuring the group is always well-funded and has access to the best markets. You are the social master who can talk the party out of trouble—or into exclusive opportunities.

**The Trade-Off**: Your direct combat contribution is minimal and unconventional. You don't deal significant damage, you don't tank, you don't heal. Your value is in preparation, negotiation, and resource optimization. In a pure combat dungeon with no intelligent enemies, you contribute little beyond your dirty tricks.

> *"The Kaupmaðr is a unique support class whose power is felt most keenly between the fights. They are the economic engine of the party, ensuring the group is always well-funded and has access to the best markets."*

## Core Mechanics

### Economic Supremacy

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Permanent bonuses to party wealth and purchasing power |
| **Skill** | WITS + Rhetoric |
| **Scaling** | Improves as reputation and investment increase |

The **Economic Supremacy** mechanic is the heart of the Kaupmaðr's identity. They are the undisputed master of the economy—their passive abilities directly and tangibly increase the party's wealth generation and purchasing power.

| Bonus | Source | Effect |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **+10% Data-Shards** | Eye for Value I | Party finds more currency from all sources |
| **+25% Sell Price** | Shrewd Appraisal | Appraised items sell for more |
| **+10% Sell / -10% Buy** | Haggler's Tongue | Better prices on all transactions |
| **Secret Stock Access** | Investment / Golden Tongue | Exclusive goods from high-rep vendors |
| **Passive Income** | Trade Routes | Permanent Data-Shard delivery |

The cumulative effect is substantial. A party with a Kaupmaðr is always better funded, which translates into better gear, more consumables, and greater overall success.

> *"The Kaupmaðr is the engine of the party's wealth. Their suite of passive abilities ensures the party is always better funded, which translates into better gear, more consumables, and greater overall success."*

### Blight Detection & Appraisal

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Identify item corruption, reveal hidden properties, assess true value |
| **Skill Check** | WITS + Rhetoric |
| **Risk** | Minor Psychic Stress when appraising [Glitched] items |

The Kaupmaðr's **Eye for Value** passive grants a critical capability: **detection of Blight corruption before equipping**. Where others might unknowingly don a cursed artifact and suffer its effects, the Kaupmaðr sees the subtle, sickly aura of corruption—the faint wrongness that marks a [Glitched] item.

| Appraisal Result | Information Gained |
|------------------|-------------------|
| **Success** | True value, hidden properties, sell price bonus |
| **Critical Success** | Nature of [Glitched] curse, Corruption gain rate, "debugging" for party |
| **Failure** | Basic information only |

This makes the Kaupmaðr the party's essential appraiser. Unknown artifacts should always pass through their hands before anyone equips them.

> *"On a [Glitched Artifact], a successful WITS check will reveal the nature of its curse and its rate of Corruption gain."*

### Trauma Economy Manipulation

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Access sanity-mending goods; create Sanctuary zones; reduce regional Stress |
| **Unique Role** | "Broker of sanity"—trades in clarity, not just goods |
| **World Impact** | Permanent improvements to settlement stability |

The Kaupmaðr's unique pillar is **Trauma Economy Manipulation**—they are not just merchants of goods, but brokers of sanity. They understand that in a world of constant psychic noise, a moment of clarity is worth more than gold.

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Trauma Broker** | Unlocks sanity-mending consumables for purchase; negotiates safe passage through [Psychic Resonance] zones |
| **Investment** | Creates "Sanctuary" effect—reduces passive Psychic Stress gain rate within settlement borders |
| **Trade Routes** | Permanently reduces ambient Psychic Stress level across entire region |

This makes the Kaupmaðr one of the few specializations that can **literally heal the world**. Their Investment and Trade Route abilities don't just benefit the party—they stabilize entire communities, reduce Blight influence, and create lasting positive change.

> *"Once per major settlement, they can use their influence to Establish a Trade Route. This not only creates a passive income but also permanently reduces the ambient Psychic Stress level in that entire region of the world map, representing the calming influence of stability, hope, and commerce."*

### Pragmatic Combat

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Unconventional debuffs and control through dirty fighting |
| **Philosophy** | Fight with wits and wealth, not martial skill |
| **Signature** | End fights with bribes instead of bloodshed |

The Kaupmaðr's combat style is **pragmatic, dirty, and unconventional**. They do not fight with trained martial skill—they fight with the dirty tricks of a survivor who has talked their way out of a thousand bad situations.

| Combat Ability | Effect |
|----------------|--------|
| **Improvised Bludgeon** | Low damage melee attack with coin-bag; [Disoriented] on solid hit |
| **Pocket Sand** | Single-target [Blinded] for 1 round |
| **Art of the Deal** | Bribe intelligent enemy to leave combat peacefully |
| **Hostile Takeover** | [Charm] enemy subordinate against their leader |

The Art of the Deal is the signature Kaupmaðr move—ending a fight not with violence but with a business proposition. It requires spending Data-Shards, but success means the enemy simply leaves. No blood, no resources expended, no risk.

> *"The Kaupmaðr attempts the unthinkable: to end a fight not with violence, but with a business proposition, preying on the desperation and greed that thrives in a broken world."*

## Abilities: The Merchant's Ledger

### Tier 1 — Foundational Commerce

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Eye for Value I** | Passive | — | +1d10 to WITS checks to find hidden loot or appraise items; detect if items are corrupted/glitched before equipping; party finds +10% Data-Shards from all sources |
| **Shrewd Appraisal** | Active | 25 Stamina | (Out of Combat) WITS + Rhetoric check reveals true value + hidden properties; +25% sell price; on [Glitched] items reveals curse nature + Corruption rate; appraising Glitched items inflicts minor Psychic Stress |
| **Improvised Bludgeon** | Active | 40 Stamina | Single-target melee attack; low Physical damage; on Solid/Critical Success inflicts [Disoriented] for 1 round |

**Eye for Value I** is your foundational expertise. Your eyes are drawn to potential profit—a loose coin, a rare component, or the subtle, sickly aura of a [Glitched Artifact]. You see what others miss.

> *"The Kaupmaðr has a natural talent for spotting things others might miss—a loose coin, a rare component, or the subtle, sickly aura of a [Glitched Artifact]."*

**Shrewd Appraisal** is the game's "Identify" ability—but grounded in skill rather than magic. You closely examine an item, assessing its make, materials, provenance, and potential market value. You see the risk associated with its corruption. You know what it's worth—and you know who will pay the most.

**Improvised Bludgeon** is your baseline combat option. You swing a heavy bag filled with scrap metal and coins. The jarring, mundane impact is a shocking moment of clarity for a mind lost in psychic static. Low damage, but the [Disoriented] status disrupts enemy actions.

### Tier 2 — Advanced Negotiation

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Haggler's Tongue** | Passive | — | +10% to all party sell prices; -10% to all party purchase costs; stacks with Shrewd Appraisal |
| **The Art of the Deal** | Active | 45 Stamina + Data-Shards | Opposed WITS + Rhetoric vs enemy WILL; success causes intelligent, non-fanatical enemy to leave combat peacefully; does not work on beasts, mindless constructs, Undying, Forlorn, or the truly mad |
| **Trauma Broker** | Passive | — | Unlocks sanity-mending consumables from high-reputation vendors; can negotiate safe passage through [Psychic Resonance] zones |
| **Pocket Sand** | Active | 25 Stamina | Single-target debuff; attempts to inflict [Blinded] for 1 round |

**Haggler's Tongue** is your economic force multiplier. You have mastered the art of the bargain—your arguments are persuasive, your demeanor confident. Every transaction the party makes is improved by your presence.

> *"All items sold by the party fetch a higher price, and all items purchased cost less."*

**The Art of the Deal** is the signature Kaupmaðr ability—the power to end combat through negotiation. You make a business proposition: accept this payment, walk away, live to profit another day. Desperation and greed are your allies. The cost in currency is deducted only if successful.

**Trauma Broker** represents your connections in the sanity trade. You know where to find the rare herbs and reagents needed to create stabilizing agents. You know the secret paths through [Psychic Resonance] zones, and you know who to bribe for safe passage.

**Pocket Sand** is the classic dirty trick. A handful of dust or debris flung into an opponent's face. [Blinded] for one round—enough time to escape, enough time for your allies to capitalize.

### Tier 3 — Mastery of the Market

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Investment** | Active | Large Data-Shard sum (out of combat) | Permanently upgrades merchant inventory + unlocks "Secret Stock"; establishes "Sanctuary" effect reducing passive Psychic Stress gain within settlement borders; massive Faction Reputation boost |
| **Hostile Takeover** | Active | 50 Stamina | Opposed WILL + Rhetoric vs intelligent enemy leader; success causes one of the leader's allies to become [Charmed] for 2 rounds |

**Investment** is your world-changing ability. You make a one-time investment in a settlement—not just money, but knowledge, connections, and the resources to build better "firewalls" against the Blight. The settlement improves permanently. Vendors upgrade. A "Sanctuary" effect takes hold, reducing the rate of passive Psychic Stress gain for all characters within the settlement's borders.

> *"The Kaupmaðr is not just a merchant; they are an investor in civilization itself. They know that a thriving, sane community is a profitable community."*

**Hostile Takeover** is your combat capstone before the ultimate. You identify the leader of an enemy group and, through shouted promises of wealth and power, attempt to turn their subordinates against them. You exploit fear and desperation. Success causes one of the leader's allies to become [Charmed]—fighting for you for 2 rounds.

### Capstone — The Golden Tongue

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Prerequisite** | 40 PP spent in Kaupmaðr tree |
| **Type** | Passive |
| **Effect 1** | Party is offered rare, exclusive "Secret Stock" goods—including unique recipes for high-tier psychic-resistance gear and stabilizing agents—without needing Investment |
| **Effect 2** | Once per major settlement, can **Establish a Trade Route**: creates permanent passive Data-Shard income AND permanently reduces ambient Psychic Stress level across the entire region |

The capstone **The Golden Tongue** represents your ascension from merchant to magnate. You don't just participate in the economy—you *are* the economy. Your reputation precedes you. Merchants offer you their best goods before you even ask.

But the true power is the Trade Route. Once per major settlement, you can use your influence and capital to establish permanent trade connections. This creates passive income—Data-Shards delivered to you periodically, forever.

More importantly, it **heals the world**. The stability, hope, and commerce of an active trade route permanently reduces the ambient Psychic Stress level across the entire region. The Blight's whispers grow quieter. The people grow calmer. Civilization strengthens.

> *"It is a tangible act of healing the world through economic power."*

This is the Kaupmaðr's ultimate fantasy: not just personal success, but world-scale positive change. Your investments compound. Your trade routes spread. And slowly, deal by deal, the broken world begins to knit itself back together.

## Systemic Integration

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Source | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Shrewd Appraisal on [Glitched] Items** | Minor Psychic Stress (looking at corruption) |
| **Failed High-Stakes Negotiations** | Potential Psychic Stress from tension |
| **Trauma Broker** | Access to sanity-mending consumables |
| **Investment** | Creates Sanctuary zones (reduces Stress gain) |
| **Trade Routes** | Permanent regional Stress reduction |

The Kaupmaðr has a **unique relationship** with the Trauma Economy. They are one of the few specializations that can actively *reduce* the world's Psychic Stress level—not just manage their own, but heal entire regions through economic development.

Their personal exposure is minimal. Appraising [Glitched] items carries a small Stress cost, but this is optional and controllable. They have no self-harm mechanics, no Corruption accumulation, no heretical bargains.

### Mitigation Tools

| Tool | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Trauma Broker** | Access to Stress-reducing consumables |
| **Investment** | Creates Sanctuary zones for safe recovery |
| **Trade Routes** | Permanent regional Stress reduction |
| **Eye for Value** | Detects corruption before it's equipped |

The Kaupmaðr's Trauma Economy contribution is **preventative and curative**. They help the party avoid Corruption (through detection), access treatment (through vendor connections), and recover safely (through Sanctuary zones).

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Bone-Setter** | Kaupmaðr funds consumables; Bone-Setter deploys them; combined logistics excellence |
| **Brewmaster** | Kaupmaðr provides reagent access and economic leverage; Brewmaster creates consumables |
| **Einbúi** | Combined expedition logistics—unmatched survival + economic capability |
| **Skjaldmær** | Wall-discipline at parleys; protection during negotiations |
| **Combat Specialists** | Better gear through purchasing power; wealth solves problems before they become fights |

> *"The Kaupmaðr is the versatile glue that holds a diverse party together."*

The Kaupmaðr synergizes with everyone because **everyone benefits from more money**. Better gear for the Warrior. More consumables for the Adept. Exclusive goods for the Mystic. Safe settlements for recovery.

### Optimal Conditions

| Situation | Advantage |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Settlement-Heavy Campaigns** | Investment and Trade Route abilities shine |
| **Social/Political Challenges** | Rhetoric mastery provides non-violent solutions |
| **Long Campaigns** | Economic advantages compound over time |
| **Intelligent Enemies** | Art of the Deal and Hostile Takeover are viable |
| **Exploration with Markets** | Appraisal and purchasing power maximize finds |

### Weakness Conditions

| Situation | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| **Pure Combat Dungeons** | Limited direct contribution |
| **Undying/Forlorn/Beasts** | Social abilities useless |
| **Isolated Wilderness** | No merchants to leverage |
| **Short Missions** | Economic advantages don't compound |
| **Resource-Scarce Areas** | Economic leverage reduced |

---

## Lore Integration

### Historical Development

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| **Pre-Glitch** | Merchant guilds operated complex trade networks |
| **Post-Glitch Chaos** | Trade collapsed; survivors learned value of coherent goods |
| **First Routes** | "Quiet corridors" between holds where Psychic Hum ran low |
| **Counting-Room Reform** | Standardized cord-tags and seal-marks reduced fraud |
| **Modern Practice** | Kaupmaðr as formal specialization with codified protocols |

The Kaupmaðr tradition evolved from necessity. In the early post-Glitch chaos, when trust had collapsed and currency was meaningless, someone had to rebuild the networks. The first Kaupmaðr were those who documented "quiet corridors"—paths where the Blight's influence was weak enough for trade.

They developed protocols: spit-pacts for binding agreements, witness lists for disputes, route-sticks for navigation. They created the infrastructure of trust that allows settlements to survive.

### Trade-Craft Tradition

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Appraise First, Promise Last** | Verify make, provenance, and drift risk before naming terms |
| **Route Hygiene** | Mark mileposts, greet the gate, pay the road-hands |
| **Quiet Leverage** | Bank favors at market nodes; spend reputation where coin fails |
| **Leave Room for Tomorrow** | Predatory terms produce famine-spirals two seasons hence |

The Kaupmaðr operates by a code—not a moral code, but a practical one. Predatory deals destroy future opportunities. Broken promises destroy Ledger-Trust. The goal is not to win every deal, but to remain in the game forever.

> *"Contract without cruelty. Leave room for tomorrow's handshake."*

### Instruments and Rites

| Instrument | Function |
|------------|----------|
| **Slates and Tallies** | Record-keeping for transactions |
| **Cord-Tags and Seal-Wax** | Authentication and anti-fraud |
| **Sample Pouches** | Verification of goods before commitment |
| **Oath-Strings** | Physical tokens binding parties to terms |
| **Route-Sticks** | Navigation aids for trade corridors |
| **Witness Lists** | Documentation for dispute resolution |

| Rite | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Spit-Pact** | Oral checksum binding parties to terms; breach incurs city-wide sanction |
| **Ghost's Share** | Floor libation before counting to acknowledge losses and reduce tavern volatility |
| **Second Cup Rule** | Poison-mitigation protocol; decline first drink, accept after witnessing the draw |

### Factional Relationships

| Faction | Relationship |
|---------|--------------|
| **Grey Blades** | Natural alliance; Kaupmaðr often serve as arbitrators |
| **Rangers Guild** | Trade partners; route security services |
| **Dvergr** | Respectful commerce; Cog Standard facilitates trade |
| **Jötun-Readers** | Information exchange; archive access fees |
| **Rust-Clans** | Careful dealings; valuable salvage, unreliable contracts |
| **God-Sleepers** | Wary; supply competition, unpredictable behavior |

The Kaupmaðr is typically an **Independent**—loyal to no faction, valuable to all. Their neutrality is their asset. They can move between hostile groups, facilitate exchanges, and arbitrate disputes precisely because they have no stake beyond the deal itself.

---

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic/Survivor)
*"In the tales, they are the silver-tongued ones, the coin-counters who can talk a Rust-Clan raider out of his loot and leave him thanking them for the privilege. They walk into hostile holds with nothing but a bag of scrap and walk out with wagons of grain and blood-debts forgiven. They see value where others see rubble. They see opportunity where others see enemies. They are the ones who make the warm fire appear when the larders are empty, who find the safe path when all roads seem blocked. They don't fight the Blight with swords or spells—they fight it with ledgers and handshakes, rebuilding the world one deal at a time. When the last trade route falls silent, they say, that's when the true darkness begins."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Kaupmaðr (Merchant-Venturer) represents the Coherent Adept specialization optimized for economic manipulation and social navigation. Mechanical role: non-combat support with wealth generation and Trauma Economy mitigation. Key differentiator: only specialization that can permanently reduce regional Psychic Stress levels through Investment and Trade Route abilities. Core mechanics: Economic Supremacy (passive bonuses to party wealth), Blight Detection (identify corruption before equipping), Trauma Broker (access to sanity-mending consumables and safe passage), Pragmatic Combat (dirty tricks and bribery). Signature ability: The Golden Tongue (Secret Stock access + Trade Route establishment for passive income and permanent regional Stress reduction). Trauma Economy interaction: Low risk—minor Stress from appraising [Glitched] items; major Stress mitigation through Sanctuary zones and Trade Routes. Optimal deployment: settlement-heavy campaigns, social/political challenges, long campaigns where economic advantages compound."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Kaupmaðr (Merchant-Venturer). ARCHETYPE: Adept. PATH TYPE: Coherent (Low Trauma Risk). ROLE: Economic Specialist / Trauma Broker / Social Navigator. PRIMARY STAT: WITS. SECONDARY STAT: WILL. RESOURCE: Stamina. CORE MECHANICS: Economic Supremacy (+10% Data-Shards, +10% sell/-10% buy, Secret Stock access), Blight Detection (identify corruption pre-equip), Trauma Economy Manipulation (Sanctuary zones, regional Stress reduction). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Commerce): Eye for Value I, Shrewd Appraisal, Improvised Bludgeon. T2 (Advanced Negotiation): Haggler's Tongue, Art of the Deal, Trauma Broker, Pocket Sand. T3 (Mastery of the Market): Investment, Hostile Takeover. CAPSTONE: The Golden Tongue (Secret Stock access + Trade Route establishment for passive income + permanent regional Psychic Stress reduction). SYNERGIES: Bone-Setter (consumable logistics), Einbúi (expedition logistics), all combat specs (better gear). COUNTERS: Undying/Forlorn/beasts (no social abilities), pure combat dungeons, isolated wilderness, short missions."*

## Summary

The Kaupmaðr is the **economic engine** of Aethelgard.

Where other Adepts heal bodies (Bone-Setter), improvise survival (Einbúi), or brew concoctions (Brewmaster), the Kaupmaðr trades in something more fundamental: **coherence itself**. They understand that in a world where trust has collapsed and sanity is scarce, the ability to facilitate exchange—to rebuild the networks of commerce and cooperation—is the most valuable skill of all.

Their power is unique. It scales not just with their own level, but with the **prosperity of the world around them**. Their Investment and Trade Route abilities allow them to actively improve the world and then reap the benefits. A Kaupmaðr who invests in settlements creates Sanctuary zones that reduce Psychic Stress. A Kaupmaðr who establishes Trade Routes heals entire regions. Their success compounds over time, creating a deeply satisfying gameplay loop of economic development and world-building.

In combat, they are unconventional but surprisingly effective. Their Art of the Deal can end fights without bloodshed. Their Hostile Takeover can turn enemies against each other. Their dirty tricks—Improvised Bludgeon, Pocket Sand—provide debuffs and control when negotiation fails.

But their true power is felt between the fights. The party with a Kaupmaðr is always better funded, always better equipped, always aware of which artifacts are safe and which are cursed. They have access to exclusive goods, sanity-mending consumables, and safe passage through dangerous zones.

They are the brokers of a broken world. They prove that the sharpest weapon is not a blade, but a well-structured contract.

*You see salvage.*
*I see three months of food for a hold.*
*You see an enemy with a blade.*
*I see a man with a price.*
*Appraise first.*
*Promise last.*
*Leave room for tomorrow's handshake.*
