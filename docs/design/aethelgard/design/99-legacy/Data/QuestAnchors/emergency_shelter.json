  "Name": "[The Emergency Shelter]",
  "Description": "Someone survived here. For a while. A reinforced safe room designed for facility disasters - and it worked. Emergency supplies remain, carefully rationed. A sleeping pallet in the corner. Data-slates filled with handwritten notes. Whoever lived here is gone now.",
  "Archetype": "Chamber",
  "SuggestedNodeType": "Branch",
  "NarrativeText": "The survivor's logs tell a story: trapped when The Great Silence fell, living on emergency rations for months, slowly losing hope. The final entry reads simply: 'Going outside. If I don't come back, at least I tried.' They never returned.",
  "FlavorText": "Shelves hold carefully organized supplies: water purifiers, medical kits, preserved food. A calendar on the wall tracks 287 days. Personal effects reveal a life lived in isolation: books, a chess set (both sides played), drawings of people they'd lost.",
