# Járn-hjortr (Mutated Cervus Nobilis Aesirensis) — Ferrous Bio-Accumulation Territorial Hazard Specification
## Codex Entry: CODX-B-JARN-001

> *"We were running a salvage corridor through the Rust-Wash when Kettil made the mistake that killed him. He'd polished his belt buckle that morning—old habit from his Midgard Combine days, said it kept him feeling civilized. The sun came through a gap in the clouds just as we crested a ridge, and that little circle of brass caught the light. I heard the bellow first. That's what you need to understand about the Iron-Elk—you hear them before you see them, and by then it's already too late to run. It came out of the scrap-thicket like a landslide with legs, head down, that crown of rusted metal aimed right at the flash. Kettil tried to drop, but the stag was on him in four heartbeats. Four. I counted. The crown caught him across the chest and threw him three meters into a collapsed gantry. The sound his ribs made... like someone stepping on a crate of empty bottles. The elk didn't stop. It turned, found the buckle where it had fallen, and gored it into the dirt until there was nothing left but a smear of brass in the rust. Then it looked at us—not charging, just... watching. Making sure we understood. We stayed frozen for what felt like an hour before it snorted, shook that terrible crown, and walked back into the thicket like nothing had happened. Kettil lasted two days. The wounds went septic almost immediately—that Blight-Tetanus they warned us about. His veins turned black and he screamed until he couldn't anymore. That's what the Járn-hjortr is. Not a beast. A lesson. The old world made something beautiful, and the Blight made it into a warning: this land remembers what metal did to it, and it will make you remember too."*

The Járn-hjortr is not merely a mutated herbivore—it is a **living geological indicator** and a horrifying demonstration of how the Runic Blight corrupts even the most benign biological systems into lethal territorial hazards.

> [!CAUTION]
> **EXTREME TERRITORIAL HAZARD. FERROUS BIO-ACCUMULATION. BLIGHT-TETANUS VECTOR.** The Járn-hjortr represents the catastrophic corruption of Vanir ornamental bio-engineering: docile park herbivores whose mineral uptake pathways have been hijacked by Blight-contaminated ferrous particulates. **Antler crowns are organic-metallic hybrid structures capable of penetrating Grade-B armor plating.** Primary detection indicators: rust-red/orange streaking on flanks visible at distance; metallic breath tang detectable at < 5 m; characteristic hoof tracks with iron filing scatter; rub-trees with embedded metal filings at 1.4–1.6 m height. **Black-flag conditions triggering immediate withdrawal:** head-toss toward any light source; hoof scrape on metal surface; bellow with metallic harmonics; flank twitch (charge imminent). **Abort gates:** any specular reflection within specimen sightline; multiple specimens in visual range; visible calf or rutting behavior indicators. Survival rate with full glint discipline protocol: 91.2%. Primary hazards: high-velocity antler impact (penetrating trauma); Blight-Tetanus infection from crown wounds (72-hour mortality without treatment); unpredictable charge triggers from environmental reflections.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Living Ornament

### Original Design Purpose

The Cervus Nobilis Aesirensis was not designed for labor or defense—it was a **biological aesthetic element**, a masterwork of Vanir bio-engineering created for the visual enrichment of Aesir habitation spaces.

| Design Parameter | Specification |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Designation** | Cervus Nobilis Aesirensis (Aesir Noble Elk) |
| **Division** | Vanir Bio-Aesthetics Division (Habitation Enhancement) |
| **Primary Function** | Visual enrichment of curated parklands and gardens |
| **Secondary Function** | Passive ecosystem maintenance (grazing, seed dispersal) |
| **Tertiary Function** | Psychological wellness indicator (docile presence promoted calm) |
| **Deployment Era** | Age of Forging (Midgard Habitation-Deck Operations) |
| **Original Network** | Integrated with Midgard Environmental Harmony Grid |

### Biological Aesthetic System

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Ornamental Antler Growth** | Engineered for symmetrical, visually pleasing antler development |
| **Mineral Uptake Pathway** | Designed to absorb calcium and trace minerals for antler osteogenesis |
| **Docility Programming** | Behavioral modification ensuring non-aggressive response to human presence |
| **Coat Coloration** | Warm, aesthetically pleasing tawny-brown optimized for park environments |
| **Network Integration** | Health monitoring via Midgard Habitation Grid; stress response suppression |

### The Noble Antlers (Original Function)

| Parameter | Pre-Glitch Specification |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Composition** | Pure keratin and bone; organic calcium-phosphate matrix |
| **Structure** | Bilaterally symmetrical; aesthetically optimized branching pattern |
| **Growth Cycle** | Annual shed and regrowth; spring-summer development |
| **Size** | 80–100 cm span (controlled genetic expression) |
| **Function** | Ornamental display; minor territorial signaling between males |
| **Safety** | Blunted tine tips; non-aggressive behavioral programming |

> [!NOTE]
> **Docile Display Animals.** Pre-Glitch Cervus Nobilis Aesirensis were engineered specifically for human cohabitation. Their antlers were ornamental sculptures of bone, their temperament was artificially placid, and their purpose was to make the curated parks of Midgard feel alive with natural beauty. They were no more dangerous than the decorative hedges they grazed beside. The Glitch transformed them from garden ornaments into walking siege engines.

## The Glitch and the Iron Sickness: Corruption Vector

### Network Severance Event

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not simply release the Cervus Nobilis—it **poisoned** their fundamental biology.

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Ginnungagap Glitch** | Instantaneous severance of Midgard Environmental Harmony Grid |
| **Docility Suppression Loss** | Behavioral modification systems disabled; natural aggression re-emerged |
| **Environmental Contamination** | Parkland soil saturated with ferrous particulates and Aetheric residue |
| **Mineral Pathway Corruption** | Blight-tainted iron began substituting for calcium in antler osteogenesis |
| **Metabolic Hijacking** | System could not distinguish beneficial minerals from toxic metal |
| **Result** | Organic-metallic hybrid antler growth; "Iron Sickness" pathology |

### The Iron Sickness Cascade

| Stage | Process |
|-------|---------|
| **1. Network Severance** | Environmental monitoring cut; contamination detection disabled |
| **2. Soil Contamination** | Industrial runoff and Aesir-Deck debris saturated grazing areas |
| **3. Ferrous Ingestion** | Mineral uptake pathway absorbed iron particulates as "nutrients" |
| **4. Blight Integration** | Runic Blight energy corrupted metabolic processing |
| **5. Osteogenic Substitution** | Iron began replacing calcium in antler bone matrix |
| **6. Behavioral Reversion** | Docility programming failed; territorial instincts returned |
| **7. Aggression Amplification** | Metal crown weight created chronic pain; pain drove aggression |
| **8. Glint Trigger Evolution** | Reflected light associated with Aetheric flares and rival crowns |

### The Corrupted Biology

| Original System | Corrupted Function |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Mineral Uptake** | Now absorbs ferrous particulates from Blight-contaminated soil |
| **Antler Osteogenesis** | Produces organic-metallic hybrid structure with embedded iron |
| **Docility Response** | Replaced by hyper-territorial aggression |
| **Visual Sensitivity** | Weaponized into glint-triggered charge behavior |
| **Antler Shedding** | Often fails entirely in advanced specimens; permanent metal accumulation |

> *"The Cervus Nobilis was designed to absorb minerals and grow beautiful antlers. When the Glitch contaminated every water source and grazing field with iron particulates and Aetheric residue, the elk kept absorbing—but now they were absorbing poison. Their biology couldn't tell the difference between calcium and rust. Their antlers grew, but they grew wrong—twisted configurations of bone and metal, heavy with the industrial detritus of a dead world. The Blight didn't just corrupt their bodies. It weaponized their beauty. The same biological system that once grew ornamental crowns for Aesir parks now grows siege rams for charging anything that reminds them of the world that broke them."*

## Behavioral Patterns

### Territorial Aggression Profile

The Járn-hjortr's deadliest attribute is not strength—it is **unpredictability**.

| Trigger | Response | Warning Time |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Specular Reflection (Glint)** | Immediate charge toward light source | 4–9 seconds |
| **Territorial Intrusion** | Warning bellow; charge if intrusion continues | 15–30 seconds |
| **Calf Proximity** | Aggressive interposition; charge on approach | 5–10 seconds |
| **Rutting Rivalry** | Male-on-male combat; incidental human targeting | Variable |
| **Metal-on-Metal Sound** | Investigation; potential charge | 20–60 seconds |

### The Glint-Charge Cycle

| Phase | Duration | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **1. Detection** | 0–2 s | Specimen detects specular reflection within 180° sightline |
| **2. Orientation** | 1–2 s | Head-toss to confirm sightline; ears forward |
| **3. Pre-Charge** | 1–2 s | Hoof scrape on substrate; flank twitch; bellow with metallic harmonics |
| **4. Charge Initiation** | 0–1 s | Weight transfer to forelimbs; head lowered; antlers oriented |
| **5. Sprint** | 4–9 s | Full-speed charge at 45–60 km/h toward reflection source |
| **6. Impact/Gore** | 1–3 s | Crown strike; goring motion; target destruction |
| **7. Assessment** | 5–15 s | Specimen evaluates target; secondary charges if reflection persists |
| **8. Disengagement** | Variable | Specimen withdraws once reflection eliminated |

### Aggression Triggers

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Glint Sensitivity** | Primary trigger; reflected light mimics rival crowns or Aetheric flares |
| **Territorial Patrol** | Males establish and defend territories around water, mineral seeps, scrap piles |
| **Resource Defense** | Aggressive response to intrusion on grazing or mineral lick sites |
| **Herd Protection** | Females with calves exhibit heightened aggression radius |
| **Pain Response** | Chronic crown weight creates baseline irritability; minor stimuli escalate |
| **Acoustic Attraction** | Metal-on-metal sounds draw investigation; may trigger charge |

### Target Prioritization Matrix

| Priority | Target | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **1** | Active light source (specular reflection) | Primary aggression trigger; must be eliminated |
| **2** | Moving targets near reflection | Associated threat; secondary targeting |
| **3** | Territorial intruders (stationary) | Ongoing threat assessment; warning-based escalation |
| **4** | Inanimate metal objects | Reflection potential; may be gored "preventatively" |
| **5** | Non-reflective distant observers | Lowest priority; ignored if glint discipline maintained |

---

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Territorial Ferrous Hazard

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Threat** | EXTREME; single charge can penetrate armor and cause fatal trauma |
| **Predictability** | LOW; glint triggers are environmental and often uncontrollable |
| **Environmental** | MODERATE; operates in salvage corridors already requiring traversal |
| **Detection** | MODERATE; rust streaking visible at distance; tracks identifiable |
| **Avoidance** | HIGH; glint discipline and territory mapping effective |
| **Engagement** | NOT RECOMMENDED; unpredictable charge timing defeats combat response |

### Engagement Profile

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Charge Speed** | 45–60 km/h (burst) |
| **Attack Method** | Crown strike + goring motion |
| **Charge Window** | 4–9 seconds from head-toss to impact |
| **Antler Penetration** | Grade-B armor; light vehicle hulls |
| **Secondary Hazard** | Blight-Tetanus infection (72-hour mortality without treatment) |
| **Pursuit Range** | Single charge; does not pursue beyond immediate territory |
| **Disengagement Trigger** | Reflection source eliminated; target exits territory |

### Four-Stage Threat Assessment Ladder

| Stage | Designation | Indicators | Action |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **1** | Territory Awareness | Known Járn-hjortr range; no active signs | Implement glint discipline; matte all reflective surfaces |
| **2** | Presence Detected | Tracks, rub-trees, distant sighting | HALT; assess positions; confirm glint discipline; plan bypass route |
| **3** | Specimen Alert | Visual contact; head elevated; ears forward | FREEZE; no sudden movement; inventory all potential reflection sources |
| **4** | Charge Imminent | Head-toss; hoof scrape; flank twitch; bellow | IMMEDIATE lateral movement; abandon reflective equipment; seek hard cover |

### Black-Flag Conditions (Immediate Withdrawal)

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Head-toss toward any light source** | Charge targeting in progress; lateral evasion |
| **Hoof scrape on metal surface** | Pre-charge behavior; abandon reflective items |
| **Bellow with metallic harmonics** | Territorial warning escalating; prepare evasion |
| **Flank twitch observed** | Sprint imminent (< 2 s); execute evasion immediately |
| **Multiple specimens in visual range** | Compound threat; abort mission and withdraw |
| **Visible calf or rutting indicators** | Heightened aggression state; maximum stand-off required |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Glint Discipline (Full Protocol)** | 2.0/10 (avoidance highly effective) |
| **Unprepared Encounter (Solo)** | 7.5/10 (single charge often fatal) |
| **Unprepared Encounter (Group)** | 6.0/10 (distributed target risk; secondary casualties) |
| **Active Charge (Caught)** | 9.0/10 (antler penetration + Blight-Tetanus) |
| **Rutting Season Encounter** | 8.5/10 (heightened aggression; reduced warning) |
| **Salvage Corridor (Glint-Rich)** | 7.0/10 (environmental reflections uncontrollable) |

---

## Field Protocols

**OWNER**: Expedition Lead (EL) • Glint Monitor (GM) • Medical Lead (ML) • Recorder (REC)

### Detection and Assessment

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Visual Scan (Distance)** | Rust streaking visible at 200+ m in good light |
| **Track Analysis** | Iron filing scatter; rust-stain deposits; hoof abrasion patterns |
| **Rub-Tree Identification** | Metal filings embedded at 1.4–1.6 m height; bark stripped |
| **Acoustic Monitoring** | Metallic harmonics in bellows; hoof-on-metal scrapes |
| **Olfactory (Close Range)** | Copper-iron breath tang detectable at < 5 m |
| **Glint Inventory** | Systematic cataloging of all reflective surfaces in party equipment |

### Field Card: Járn-hjortr Encounter Protocols

#### BEFORE (Expedition Preparation — Jötunheim/Midgard Border Operations)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Research known Járn-hjortr territories along planned route |
| 2 | Matte all reflective surfaces (buckles, tools, armor, optics) |
| 3 | Issue non-reflective equipment covers and tool wraps |
| 4 | Brief personnel on glint discipline and charge-window timing |
| 5 | Stage Blight-Tetanus prophylaxis kits with ML |
| 6 | Establish territory bypass routes; identify hard cover positions |

#### DURING (Territory Transit — Stage 1-2)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Maintain glint discipline; GM confirms zero specular surfaces exposed |
| 2 | Continuous visual scanning; flag any rust-streaked specimens at distance |
| 3 | Route around identified rub-trees and mineral seeps |
| 4 | Minimize metal-on-metal contact; acoustic discipline |
| 5 | Consolidated formation; maintain visual contact; no stragglers |
| 6 | Weather watch; sudden sun breaks create uncontrolled reflections |

#### DURING (Specimen Detected — Stage 3)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | HALT ALL MOVEMENT; freeze in place |
| 2 | GM conducts emergency glint inventory; matte any exposed surfaces |
| 3 | Assess specimen posture (grazing = low risk; head elevated = alert) |
| 4 | Identify lateral evasion routes and hard cover positions |
| 5 | Prepare to abandon reflective equipment on EL command |
| 6 | If specimen alert: NO eye contact; slow lateral movement away |

#### DURING (Charge Imminent — Stage 4)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | IMMEDIATE lateral movement (perpendicular to charge line) |
| 2 | ABANDON all reflective equipment (drop and move) |
| 3 | Seek hard cover (gantry supports, rock formations, vehicle hulls) |
| 4 | Do NOT run directly away (charge speed exceeds human sprint) |
| 5 | If impact unavoidable: fetal position protecting head/neck |
| 6 | Post-charge: remain still until specimen withdraws (secondary charges possible) |

#### AFTER

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Confirm specimen disengagement (visual observation ≥ 10 minutes) |
| 2 | Medical assessment for penetrating trauma; ML initiates Blight-Tetanus protocol |
| 3 | Wound cleaning critical within 30 minutes (Blight-Tetanus prophylaxis) |
| 4 | Equipment audit; recover abandoned items only after full withdrawal |
| 5 | Document: specimen size, crown configuration, charge triggers, casualties |
| 6 | Update territory mapping with new activity data |

**OUTCOME:** Salvage crew transits Rust-Wash corridor (known elk territory). GM identifies mature male at 120 m, grazing posture. Crew halts; glint inventory confirms one exposed buckle on REC. GM mattes buckle with mud wrap. Crew resumes transit via bypass route. Specimen does not alert. Zero casualties; transit delay 22 minutes. Survival rate with glint discipline: 91.2%.

### Blight-Tetanus Protocol

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Pathogen** | Bacterial colonies thriving in oxidized metal-tissue interface of antler wounds |
| **Onset** | 12–24 hours post-exposure (rapid progression) |
| **Symptoms** | Wound blackening, venous discoloration, muscle rigidity, systemic sepsis |
| **Mortality** | 85–95% without treatment; 72-hour average survival (untreated) |
| **Prophylaxis** | Immediate wound debridement + antiseptic irrigation + Dvergr antibacterial compound |
| **Treatment Window** | Effective treatment requires initiation within 6 hours of wound |
| **Field Protocol** | ML priority: any crown wound = immediate Blight-Tetanus protocol initiation |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Carrying unmatted reflective equipment** | Creates uncontrolled glint triggers |
| **Direct approach to grazing specimens** | May trigger territorial response |
| **Running directly away from charge** | Charge speed (45–60 km/h) exceeds human sprint |
| **Attempting to "scare off" specimens** | Increases aggression; may trigger charge |
| **Approaching specimens with calves** | Maternal aggression radius significantly expanded |
| **Crown trophy harvesting without ML support** | Blight-Tetanus exposure from handling |

### Doctrine: Glint Discipline

> **Historical Validation:** Rangers Guild data (89 documented encounters, 24-month observation period in Jötunheim/Midgard border regions) confirms 91.2% survival rate with full glint discipline protocol; 34.8% survival rate without protocol adherence. Territory mapping demonstrates 94% effectiveness in charge avoidance. **The Járn-hjortr is not a creature you fight. It is a creature you do not provoke. Their aggression is not malice—it is corrupted instinct, the broken programming of an animal designed for beauty and cursed to wear the war on its head. They charge at light because light means danger in their ruined minds—the flash of Aetheric failure, the gleam of a rival's metal crown, the glint of the world that poisoned them. You cannot reason with this. You cannot intimidate it. You can only ensure that nothing on your person, nothing in your convoy, nothing in your possession catches the sun at the wrong moment. Matte your buckles. Wrap your tools. Cover your optics. And when you see those rust-streaked flanks in the distance, move slowly, move quietly, and move away. Because the Járn-hjortr doesn't want to kill you. It wants to kill the light. And if you're standing in front of the light, you become the same thing.**

## Ecological Role

### The Indicator of Contamination

The Járn-hjortr occupies a unique **bio-indicator position** in Jötunheim and Midgard's contaminated ecosystem—a living measurement of environmental ferrous saturation.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Geological Indicator** | Crown metal composition reflects local ruin metallurgy; prospecting value |
| **Contamination Proxy** | Population density correlates with soil ferrous particulate concentration |
| **Ecosystem Grazer** | Primary herbivore maintaining vegetation in scrap-adjacent zones |
| **Mineral Cycling** | Concentrates dispersed ferrous material into crown structures |
| **Human Impact** | Moderate biological threat to salvage operations; route planning required |

### Impact Assessment

| Target Category | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Civilian Expeditions** | MODERATE; predictable with proper glint discipline |
| **Salvage Convoys** | SIGNIFICANT; environmental reflections create uncontrolled triggers |
| **Agricultural Operations** | HIGH; territorial behavior disrupts livestock and crop management |
| **Settlement Proximity** | MODERATE; drawn to mineral seeps near habitation |
| **Scientific Research** | VALUABLE; crown analysis provides metallurgical intelligence |

### Population Dynamics

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Estimated Population** | 2,000–3,500 individuals (Jötunheim/Midgard range) |
| **Territory Size** | 5–15 km² per male; females range across multiple male territories |
| **Breeding Cycle** | Annual; autumn rut; spring calving |
| **Herd Composition** | Mixed female/juvenile groups (3–8); solitary or bachelor males |
| **Crown Development** | Progressive metal accumulation with age; "Scrap Kings" (10+ years) |
| **Lifespan** | 12–18 years (crown weight mortality factor in advanced specimens) |

## Factional Perspectives

### Common Folk & Skalds: The Garden's Vengeance — "Rust-Stags"

The common folk regard the Járn-hjortr as **nature's retribution**—proof that the land itself remembers the sins of the Age of Forging.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Cursed remnants of the Vanir gardens; nature turned weapon |
| **Response** | Absolute avoidance; roadside shrine offerings |
| **Cultural Role** | Symbol of the old world's corruption; teaching tool for children |
| **Mythology** | "Where the earth bleeds metal, the elk crown themselves with rust" |
| **Folk Wisdom** | "Flash your blade where the Rust-Stag walks, and rust shall crown your own head come winter" |

> *"The old songs say the Iron-Elk were once the gentlest creatures in all the Vanir gardens—beautiful stags with crowns of white bone that grazed in the parks where the ancestors walked with their families. But the ancestors made the world sick with metal, and the gardens died, and the gentle stags drank from poisoned streams and grazed in poisoned fields. Now they wear the sickness on their heads, and they remember what metal did to them. When you see a Rust-Stag, child, remember: that crown is not decoration. It is accusation. The land crowned them with the war we started, and they will never, ever forgive us for it."*

### Jötun-Reader Scriptorium: Case Study — "Cervus Nobilis Ferrous Accumulation Pathology"

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Corrupted bio-asset; mineral pathway hijacking specimen |
| **Research Value** | Demonstrates bio-accumulation adaptation to Blight conditions |
| **Critical Interest** | Crown metallurgy; behavioral corruption; Blight-Tetanus bacteriology |
| **Diagnostic Focus** | Antler composition analysis; aggression trigger mapping; infection vectors |
| **Philosophy** | "The elk show us how the Blight turns biological systems against themselves" |

> *"Subject CODX-B-JARN-001 demonstrates complete mineral pathway corruption following Ginnungagap Glitch environmental contamination. Original designation: Cervus Nobilis Aesirensis (Vanir Bio-Aesthetics Division). Original function: ornamental herbivore for Midgard Habitation-Deck parklands; engineered for docility, symmetrical antler aesthetics, and human cohabitation. Post-Glitch corruption vector: soil and water contamination with ferrous particulates saturated grazing areas; Blight-tainted iron substituted for calcium in osteogenic pathways; behavioral modification systems failed with network severance; natural territorial aggression returned and amplified by chronic crown-weight pain. Antler analysis reveals metallurgical composition correlating with local ruin debris—specimens effectively function as geological indicators, their crowns a living assay of environmental metal contamination. Glint-trigger behavior represents associative corruption: reflected light mimics both rival crown flash and Aetheric failure signatures. Blight-Tetanus infection vector localized to oxidized metal-tissue interface within crown structure; bacterial colonies thrive in anaerobic pockets between bone and iron accretion. Research priority: understanding bio-accumulation pathway for potential remediation applications; crown metallurgy for prospecting intelligence."*

## Loot & Rewards

| Drop | Rarity | Value | Use |
|------|--------|-------|-----|
| **Rusted Crown Fragment** | Uncommon | 80–150 PS | Metallurgical analysis; decorative inlay; alchemical |
| **Intact Crown (Scrap King)** | Rare | 300–500 PS | Research specimens; trophy; prestige crafting |
| **Rust-Streak Hide** | Uncommon | 120–200 PS | Armor crafting; fashion trade; insulation |
| **Iron-Elk Meat** | Common | 40–60% clean game | Secondary protein market (metallic taste) |
| **Ferrous Bone Fragments** | Uncommon | 30–50 PS | Alchemical reagent; tool reinforcement |
| **Crown Tissue Sample** | Rare | 200–350 PS | Blight-Tetanus research; Jötun-Reader contracts |

**Salvage Protocol:** Active hunting is **moderately hazardous** (65–75% success rate with prepared crews) but economically marginal for most operations. Preferred acquisition: natural mortality recovery (specimen died of other causes); post-charge retrieval (specimen withdrew after attack); Dvergr research contracts (organized specimen acquisition). The Jötun-Reader Scriptorium maintains standing contracts for crown tissue samples and complete crown structures for bio-accumulation research. Baron salvage crews occasionally harvest elk opportunistically when specimens are encountered during primary operations, but dedicated hunting operations are rarely cost-effective given the risk-to-reward ratio.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Survivor Lore

> *"In the time before the silence, the gardens of the ancestors held creatures of surpassing beauty—great stags with crowns of white bone who grazed in the eternal spring of the parklands. They were gentle as morning mist, and the children of the ancestors would feed them from their hands without fear. But the ancestors made war upon themselves, and the war made poison, and the poison seeped into every stream and every blade of grass. The gentle stags drank and grazed, and the poison crowned them. Now they wear the war on their heads—twisted iron and rusted steel where white bone once grew—and they remember. Oh, child, they remember. When you see the light catch something bright, and a Rust-Stag lifts its terrible crown, know that it is not you it hates. It hates the light. It hates the flash of metal that reminds it of what the ancestors did to its world. But hate does not distinguish. If you stand between the stag and the light, you become the same as the light. So dull your blades. Wrap your buckles. And when the sun breaks through the clouds in Iron-Crown country, make yourself shadow. Because the Garden's Vengeance does not forgive, and it does not forget, and every flash of light is another reminder of everything it lost."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Rust-Stag, Iron-Crown, Crown-Bearer, the Garden's Vengeance, war-crowned, rust-blessed, the ancestors' sin

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Cervus Nobilis Aesirensis, bio-accumulation, osteogenesis, mineral uptake pathway, ferrous particulate

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic) — Jötun-Reader Field Observations

> *"Subject CODX-B-JARN-001 demonstrates catastrophic mineral pathway corruption following Ginnungagap Glitch environmental contamination. Original designation: Cervus Nobilis Aesirensis (Vanir Bio-Aesthetics Division, Midgard Habitation Enhancement). Pre-Glitch function: ornamental herbivore engineered for docility and aesthetic antler development. Post-Glitch corruption vector: soil saturation with ferrous particulates and Aetheric residue contaminated grazing pathways; Blight integration corrupted osteogenic mineral uptake; iron substituted for calcium in antler bone matrix, producing organic-metallic hybrid crown structures. Crown composition analysis reveals direct correlation with local ruin metallurgy—specimens function as bio-geological indicators, their antlers a living assay of environmental contamination. Behavioral corruption: docility programming failed with network severance; territorial aggression returned and amplified by chronic pain from crown weight (8–15 kg). Glint-trigger response represents associative corruption—reflected light mimics rival crown flash and Aetheric failure signatures, generating automatic charge response (4–9 second window). Blight-Tetanus infection vector isolated to oxidized metal-tissue interface within crown structure; anaerobic bacterial colonies thrive in junction zones. Field protocols emphasize glint discipline: matte all reflective surfaces, maintain ≥ 40 m stand-off, execute lateral evasion if charge initiated. Research priority: bio-accumulation pathway analysis for environmental remediation applications."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Cervus Nobilis Aesirensis, bio-accumulation, osteogenic corruption, ferrous particulate, glint-trigger, Blight-Tetanus, mineral pathway hijacking

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Modern scientific terminology beyond setting lexicon, romantic/mythic framing

### Layer 3 (Technical) — Pre-Glitch Context

> *"UNIT DESIGNATION: Cervus Nobilis Aesirensis. DIVISION: Vanir Bio-Aesthetics Division (Habitation Enhancement Subdivision). PRIMARY FUNCTION: Ornamental herbivore for Midgard Habitation-Deck curated parklands. SECONDARY FUNCTION: Passive ecosystem maintenance (grazing, seed dispersal). BIOLOGICAL ARCHITECTURE: Engineered docility response; optimized antler osteogenesis for bilateral symmetry; mineral uptake pathway calibrated for calcium-phosphate matrix production; coat coloration modified for aesthetic appeal. OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS: Free-range within designated park boundaries; population controlled via breeding program; health monitoring via Midgard Environmental Harmony Grid integration. POST-GLITCH STATUS: Network severance disabled docility programming; environmental contamination corrupted mineral uptake pathways; ferrous particulate substitution in osteogenic processes; behavioral reversion to pre-engineering territorial aggression patterns. CORRUPTION CLASSIFICATION: BIO-ACCUMULATION PATHWAY HIJACKING — mineral uptake systems intact but processing contaminated input; behavioral modification systems failed; crown structure now organic-metallic hybrid. RESTORATION ASSESSMENT: Mineral pathway restoration theoretically possible if contamination eliminated; practical implementation not achieved; behavioral reversion appears permanent in current specimens."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Cervus Nobilis Aesirensis, Vanir Bio-Aesthetics Division, osteogenesis, mineral uptake pathway, Midgard Environmental Harmony Grid, bio-accumulation

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Romantic epithets, mystical framing, survivor cant
