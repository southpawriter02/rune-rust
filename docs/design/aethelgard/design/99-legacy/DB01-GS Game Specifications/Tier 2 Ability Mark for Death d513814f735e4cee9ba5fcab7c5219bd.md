## Core Identity

You focus your intent on a single target, studying its subtle flaws—**the limp in its gait, the gap in its armor plates, the telltale twitch of Blight corruption**. You mark it as your chosen prey, the primary threat to be eliminated. Your entire being narrows to a single purpose: **this target will fall.**

## Tactical Applications

**Core Combat Loop:**

```
Turn 1: Mark for Death (Free Action) + Aimed Shot
Turn 2: Aimed Shot (+25% damage)
Turn 3: Aimed Shot (+25% damage)
...repeat until target eliminated
```

**Synergies:**

- **Aimed Shot:** Primary delivery mechanism for mark bonus
- **Heartseeker Shot:** Gains additional +2d10 damage vs marked targets
- **Stalker of the Unseen:** Marking reveals vulnerabilities and corruption level

---

## Trauma Trade-off

The **+2 Psychic Stress** represents the mental strain of intensely observing corruption. Mitigate with:

- **Predator's Focus:** Bonus to Stress resistance while in back row
- Strategic use (don't spam—mark priority targets only)
