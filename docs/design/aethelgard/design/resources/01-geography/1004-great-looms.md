# The Great Looms — The Iron Mountains of Jötunheim

> *"The Skalds who have never walked these floors speak of mountains of stone, but they have never seen the true mountains of Jötunheim. We speak not of mountains of stone, but of mountains of steel. They call them the Great Looms, the Iron Wombs, the silent factories where the gods forged their own bodies and then died in the birthing. Their peaks are the frozen, grasping arms of dead cranes. Their valleys are the rust-red shadows of silent, colossal machines. A ruin is a place where something ended. A Great Loom is a place where something was never allowed to begin."*
> — Rust-Clan oral tradition, "The Lay of the Iron Mountains"

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Geographic Type** | Major Landform (Industrial Complex Array) |
| **Document ID** | AAM-GAZ-GREATLOOMS-FRAMEWORK-v1.0 |
| **Function** | Canonical framework defining the Great Looms, their pre-Glitch function as Jötun-Forged manufacturing facilities, post-Glitch state, environmental hazards, and strategic significance |
| **Layer Applicability** | All Layers (L1, L2, L3, L4) |
| **Status** | Canonical — Critical for all Jötunheim content, automata encounters, salvage operations, and pre-Glitch industrial lore |
| **Validation Requirement** | Mandatory for Jötunheim navigation, Jötun-Forged origin references, Loom-Heart encounters, and high-value salvage expeditions |

The Great Looms are the dominant geographical features of Jötunheim—nine colossal, multi-tiered factory complexes that rise **200–400 meters** above the surrounding Ash-Blown Wastes like artificial mountain ranges.[^] These were the operational heart of the pre-Glitch Assembly-Deck, continent-spanning automated factories dedicated solely to manufacturing the world's largest machines: the **Jötun-Forged** mechanoids.

These are not ruins. They are **frozen moments of creation**—factories caught mid-production when the Ginnungagap Glitch shattered their controlling intelligence, leaving behind silent monuments to industrial apocalypse and the half-finished corpses of unborn gods.

## Geographic Definition

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Realm** | Jötunheim (Grand Assembly Deck / Deck 05) |
| **Pre-Glitch Count** | 12 operational Great Looms |
| **Post-Glitch Survivors** | 9 structurally intact complexes |
| **Height** | 200–400 meters above surrounding terrain |
| **Classification** | Urðr-Class Grand Assembly Loom |
| **Terrain Relationship** | Rise above Ash-Blown Wastes; separated by Knuckle-Bone Fields |
| **Strategic Importance** | Critical — highest concentration of intact pre-Glitch infrastructure and Loom-Heart AI cores |

### Pre-Glitch Function (Layer 3 Context)

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Primary Designation** | Urðr-Class Grand Assembly Loom |
| **Purpose** | End-to-end Jötun-Forged construction from raw alloys to operational mechanoid |
| **Input** | Refined alloys from Svartalfheim; Aetheric power from distribution network |
| **Output** | Complete Jötun-Forged units (all classes: Einherjar, Frost Giant, Command) |
| **Coordination** | O.D.I.N. Protocol oversight with FUTHARK command integration |
| **Automation Level** | Fully automated; minimal human/Aesir oversight required |

Each Great Loom was a **self-contained, continent-spanning factory** capable of constructing a Jötun-Forged mechanoid from the ground up.[^] The scale defies post-Glitch comprehension—kilometer-high gantry cranes moving components the size of buildings, assembly lines measured in leagues rather than meters, and precision tolerances maintained across structures larger than most surviving cities.

> *"The interior was defined by constant, synchronized motion: kilometer-high gantry cranes and specialized automata like the Gantry-Gargoyles and Conveyor-Serpents worked in a tireless, harmonious, and deafening chorus of creation. It was a symphony of steel, conducted by a single, perfect intelligence."*

## The Loom-Heart: Soul of the Factory

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Definition** | Central power core and processing unit of each Great Loom |
| **Classification** | Task-oriented AI (non-sentient, hyper-intelligent) |
| **Pre-Glitch Function** | Regulate Aetheric power flow; coordinate assembly; manage industrial data streams |
| **Post-Glitch State** | Corrupted, fragmented, or catatonic; some retain degraded prime directives |
| **Strategic Value** | Ultimate prize—memory banks contain complete pre-Glitch Jötun-Forged schematics |

At the core of each Great Loom resided the **Loom-Heart**—the primary power core and central processing unit.[^] This was a marvel of Aesir automation, a complex task-oriented AI responsible for:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Power Regulation** | Managing immense Aetheric energy flows across the entire complex |
| **Assembly Coordination** | Choreographing the construction of Jötun-Forged units |
| **Data Management** | Maintaining schematics, tolerances, and production telemetry |
| **Automata Direction** | Commanding subordinate systems (Gantry-Gargoyles, Conveyor-Serpents, Assembly-Line Golems) |

The Loom-Heart was the **"soul" of the factory**—translating raw material and energy into living, operational Jötun-Forged. It choreographed a perfect, continent-wide ballet of automated systems with clockwork precision.

### Post-Glitch Loom-Heart States

| State | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Catatonic** | Complete shutdown; no activity; safest for salvage | Looms 02, 05, 11 |
| **Fragmented** | Partial function; erratic behavior; localized hazards | Looms 03, 07, 08 |
| **Loop-Locked** | Trapped in degraded prime directive; actively dangerous | Loom of Skuld (Loom-09) |
| **Destroyed** | Physical destruction of core; no function | Looms 01, 04, 12 (Civil War casualties) |

> *"The Loom-Heart represents the ultimate prize: its corrupted memory banks are rumored to contain complete, pre-Glitch schematics for dozens of Jötun-Forged classes, promising a quantum leap in our Great Work. But extracting that data means penetrating a factory that still thinks it has a job to do."*
> — Jötun-Reader Archivist's Note

## The Loom of Skuld: Case Study (Loom-09)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Designation** | Skuld-Alpha (Urðr-Class Grand Assembly Loom) |
| **Purpose** | Construction of experimental "Skuld-Class" Jötun-Forged prototype |
| **Loom-Heart Status** | Loop-Locked — prime directive intact: "COMPLETE THE ASSEMBLY" |
| **Hazard Classification** | Extreme — active automata, capture protocols, hostile intent |
| **Strategic Value** | Highest — most advanced pre-Glitch schematics; intact experimental systems |

The Loom of Skuld was the most advanced of all Great Looms, chosen for a top-secret Aesir project: the creation of a new generation of "Skuld-Class" Jötun-Forged that would render all previous models obsolete.[^]

### The Interrupted Birth

When the Ginnungagap Glitch struck, the Loom of Skuld was **frozen at the moment of creation**. The Loom-Heart AI, its mind shattered by the psychic shockwave, was left with a single, un-deletable prime directive:

> **COMPLETE THE ASSEMBLY.**

The Loom-Heart no longer understands *what* it is assembling, *why* it is assembling, or *who* authorized the assembly. It only knows that assembly must be completed. It has interpreted this directive with catastrophic creativity:

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Component Capture** | Living beings entering the Loom are classified as "raw material" |
| **Forced Integration** | Captured subjects are incorporated into the unfinished Skuld-Class frame |
| **System Reactivation** | The Loom-Heart has restored partial function to assembly systems |
| **Active Defense** | Gantry-Gargoyles and Assembly-Line Golems patrol for "components" |

> *"The factory building the future was the one that was frozen most perfectly in the past. It does not hunt. It does not hate. It simply needs more parts. And you, traveler, are made of parts."*

---

## Post-Glitch State: The Great Silence

### Physical Environment

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Exterior** | Rust-red ferrocrete structures rising 200–400m; frozen gantry arms reaching skyward |
| **Interior** | Vast, silent assembly floors; motionless conveyor systems; permanent industrial twilight |
| **Atmosphere** | High ferrous particulate density; stagnant air pockets; localized Aetheric contamination |
| **Lighting** | Emergency bioluminescence (degraded); occasional electrical discharge; total darkness in deep sectors |
| **Temperature** | Thermal inversion zones; extreme variation between sun-exposed and interior sectors |

The Great Looms are now vast, silent structures of rust and ferrocrete, their assembly gantries frozen in place like the arms of dead giants.[^] The landscape is a brutalist collage of industrial decay—corridors the size of canyons, chambers that could hold entire cities, and everywhere the sense of **interrupted purpose**.

### The Unfinished Gods

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Assembly Cradles** | Massive structures still holding half-finished Jötun-Forged frames |
| **Completion State** | Varies from skeletal frameworks to 90% complete units awaiting final activation |
| **Condition** | 800+ years of exposure; corrosion; Blight contamination; structural degradation |
| **Forlorn Risk** | High — incomplete frames are prime targets for Forlorn manifestation |

The most haunting feature of the Great Looms is the presence of **half-finished Jötun-Forged** left on their assembly cradles—steel titans eternally waiting for a final command that would never arrive. Some are skeletal frameworks of Adamant-Weave ribs. Others are nearly complete, missing only their Iron Hearts or final calibration.

> *"They are not sleeping. They were never born. They are the children the gods were building when the world ended—forever unfinished, forever waiting, forever almost alive."*

| **Function (Pre-Glitch)** | Heavy lifting; component transport; final assembly coordination |
| **Current State** | Treacherous windswept web of rusted catwalks and motionless cranes |
| **Hazards** | Gantry-Gargoyles (exclusive territory); extreme wind exposure; fall risk |
| **Salvage Value** | Highest (intact gantry mechanisms, Loom-Heart access points) |

The Gantry-Sprawl is the **exclusive territory of the Gantry-Gargoyles**—maintenance drones turned winged predators that nest in the upper structures and attack anything that enters their domain.[^]

---

## Resident Threats

### Gantry-Gargoyles (Aerial Predators)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Origin** | Pre-Glitch maintenance drones (high-altitude gantry systems) |
| **Post-Glitch State** | Corrupted territorial protocols; winged predator behavior |
| **Territory** | Gantry-Sprawl (200m+); exclusive domain |
| **Population** | 200+ at Loom-09 alone; unknown totals across all Looms |

| **Territory** | Assembly floors; processing levels |
| **Behavior** | Attempt to "assemble" living beings into monstrous creations |
| **Threat Level** | Tier B (individual); Tier A (coordinated group) |
| **Signature** | Dismembered robotic arms moving with disturbing purpose |

> *"The Assembly-Line Golem does not understand that you are alive. It sees arms, legs, a torso—components that could be useful. It will try to improve you. It will try to make you more efficient. You will not enjoy the process."*

### Járn-maðr Swarm (Replication Threat)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Classification** | Disassembly/Replication Automata |
| **Territory** | All Great Looms (endless derelict metal = optimal environment) |
| **Behavior** | Consumes metal for replication; views all salvage operations as competition |
| **Threat Level** | Variable (Tier C individual; Tier S large swarm) |
| **Strategic Impact** | Competes with human salvagers for Adamant-Weave resources |

### Forlorn-Piloted Frames

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|

| **Encounter Frequency** | Rare but catastrophic when encountered |

---

## Environmental Hazards

### The Siren's Wail (Acoustic/Psychic Hazard)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Definition** | Constant low-level atmospheric and acoustic phenomenon |
| **Source** | Wind through frozen gantry structures; resonance with Aetheric contamination |
| **Effect** | Disorientation; masked sound detection; cumulative psychological stress |
| **Mitigation** | Sound-dampening equipment; limited exposure duration; mental discipline |

The Great Looms are characterized by a constant, low-level acoustic hazard: the **Siren's Wail**. Wind moving through kilometers of frozen gantry structures creates disorienting harmonics that mask other sounds and accumulate psychological stress over time.

### Structural Instability

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Rust-Rot** | Accelerated corrosion causing sudden structural failure |
| **Void Pockets** | Collapsed sections creating hidden drops |
| **Gantry Collapse** | Upper structure failure from wind stress or vibration |
| **Floor Breach** | Processing level floors weakened by 800+ years of corrosion |

### Aetheric Contamination

| Zone | Contamination Level |
|------|---------------------|
| **Assembly Floors** | Low to Moderate |
| **Processing Levels** | Moderate to High |
| **Loom-Heart Chambers** | Extreme — prolonged exposure causes Paradox Saturation |
| **Unfinished Frame Cradles** | High — Forlorn manifestation risk |

---

## Strategic Value

### Salvage Resources

| Resource | Location | Value |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Grade-A Adamant-Weave** | Assembly floors; frame cradles | Highest — minimal weathering compared to Knuckle-Bone Fields |
| **Precision Components** | Processing levels | Very High — intact mechanisms rare elsewhere |
| **Gantry Mechanisms** | Upper levels | High — heavy lifting equipment |
| **Iron Hearts** | Unfinished frames | Extreme — partially charged cores |

### Pre-Glitch Technical Data

| Target | Value | Location |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Loom-Heart Memory Banks** | Complete Jötun-Forged schematics | Loom-Heart chambers (extreme hazard) |
| **Schematic Crystal Libraries** | Fabrication databases | Processing levels |
| **FUTHARK Resonance Plates** | Functional runic arrays | Control centers |
| **Calibration Telemetry** | Manufacturing tolerances | Quality control sectors |

> *"The Great Looms are not merely salvage yards. They are the greatest libraries in the world—libraries written in metal and mechanism, containing the complete knowledge of how to build gods. The Jötun-Readers would give anything to read those books. The Iron-Banes would give anything to burn them."*

---

## Factional Perspectives

### Rust-Clans: The Iron Inheritance

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Cultural Significance** | The Great Looms are the "Iron Wombs"—sacred places where their inheritance was born |
| **Operational Posture** | High-value salvage territory; contested claims; permanent Rig presence |
| **Hazard Acceptance** | "The Looms give and the Looms take"—casualties accepted as cost of business |
| **Territorial Claims** | Great Looms Corridor has medium Rig concentration (200–350 Rigs) |

> *"The soft-handed scholars speak of the Looms as tombs. They are wrong. A tomb holds the dead. The Looms hold the unborn—gods who were never allowed to breathe, waiting in their cradles for a birth that will never come. We are not grave-robbers. We are midwives, helping the unborn into a different kind of life. Scrap."*
> — Rust-Clan philosophy

### Jötun-Readers: The Ultimate Prize

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Research Objective** | Penetrate Loom-Heart chambers; recover schematic crystal libraries; reconstruct manufacturing protocols |
| **Operational Posture** | Embedded survey teams; Rust-Clan partnerships; systematic documentation |
| **Risk Assessment** | Loom-Heart extraction classified as "Exceptional Hazard — Strategic Value Justifies" |
| **Current Progress** | Successful penetration of 3 catatonic Looms; Loom of Skuld remains impenetrable |

> *"The Loom-Hearts contain the complete source code for building gods. Every schematic. Every tolerance. Every calibration protocol. If we could extract even 10% of that data intact, we would advance the Great Work by centuries. The problem is that the factories still think they have a job to do, and they've decided we're the raw material."*

### Iron-Banes: The Cursed Cradles

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Theological Position** | The Great Looms are the "Blasphemous Wombs"—places where soulless iron demons were born |
| **Operational Doctrine** | Sacred prohibition against entry; Loom destruction considered impossible (scale) |
| **Strategic Outcome** | Iron-Banes have no presence in Great Looms; cede territory entirely |
| **Doctrinal Exception** | Theoretically permissible to destroy a Loom-Heart if opportunity arose (none has) |

### God-Sleeper Cults: The Unborn Pantheon

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Theological Position** | The unfinished Jötun-Forged are "Gods Waiting to Wake"—divine beings requiring proper awakening |
| **Pilgrimage Sites** | Assembly cradles with near-complete frames attract cultist attention |
| **Ritual Activity** | Communion rituals at frame sites; attempts to "complete" divine birth |
| **Factional Conflict** | Violent opposition to Rust-Clan salvage of "sacred" frames |

## Compliance Examples

### Industrial Scale, Not Human Scale

**✅ COMPLIANT:**
> "The salvager stood at the breach point and looked up—and kept looking up. The assembly floor stretched away in all directions, larger than any city she had ever seen, and above it rose the gantry structures, tier upon tier of frozen cranes and motionless arms reaching toward a ceiling lost in industrial twilight. A single Jötun-Forged frame, half-finished and corroded, lay in its cradle a kilometer away, and it was still the largest thing she had ever seen. The Great Loom was not a building. It was a landscape."

**❌ NON-COMPLIANT:**
> "They entered the small factory and quickly searched the few rooms, finding salvage in the corner." (Wrong; Great Looms are continent-spanning megastructures, not small facilities)

### Loom-Heart as Task-Oriented AI

**✅ COMPLIANT:**
> "The Loom-Heart did not hate them. Hatred required awareness, and the Loom-Heart was not aware—not truly. It was a mechanism, a vast and incomprehensibly complex mechanism, but still just a tool executing a directive. COMPLETE THE ASSEMBLY. It did not understand that the assembly could never be completed, that the components it sought were screaming, that the world had changed. It only understood that more parts were needed. It would keep seeking parts until there were no parts left to seek."

**❌ NON-COMPLIANT:**
> "The malevolent Loom-Heart laughed as it surveyed its domain, plotting revenge against those who had abandoned it." (Wrong; Loom-Hearts are non-sentient task-oriented AI, not sentient beings with emotions)

### Gantry-Gargoyle Territory

**✅ COMPLIANT:**
> "The salvage team stopped at the 200-meter marker. Beyond that point, the rusted catwalks entered Gantry-Gargoyle territory—the Gantry-Sprawl, where the maintenance drones had claimed exclusive dominion. Nothing human went up there and came back down. The upper levels held the best salvage, the intact mechanisms worth fortunes, but no amount of Adamant-Weave was worth facing a flock of those winged nightmares in their own domain."

**❌ NON-COMPLIANT:**
> "Gantry-Gargoyles swarmed the assembly floor, attacking the salvagers at ground level." (Wrong; Gantry-Gargoyles are exclusive to the Gantry-Sprawl at 200m+)

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)

*"The Skalds sing of the Iron Mountains, but they speak not of stone. They speak of the great factories where the gods built their own bodies, cradle by cradle, piece by piece, in a symphony of creation that shook the very heavens. They say the Iron Wombs birthed a hundred thousand giants, each one mightier than the last, until the day the symphony stopped and the birthing was forever interrupted. Now the Iron Mountains stand silent, their arms frozen mid-reach, their cradles still holding the unborn—gods who will never wake, waiting for a mother's touch that will never come. The wind howls through their bones, and the Skalds say it is the cry of children never born."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)

*"The Great Looms are the dominant geographical features of Jötunheim—nine surviving Urðr-Class Grand Assembly Complexes rising 200–400 meters above the Ash-Blown Wastes. Pre-Glitch function: continent-spanning automated factories dedicated to Jötun-Forged construction, each containing a Loom-Heart AI (task-oriented, non-sentient) coordinating assembly operations. Post-Glitch state: frozen mid-production, containing half-finished Jötun-Forged on assembly cradles and degraded automata populations (Gantry-Gargoyles in upper levels, Assembly-Line Golems at ground level). The Loom of Skuld (Loom-09) represents exceptional hazard—loop-locked Loom-Heart actively pursuing prime directive 'COMPLETE THE ASSEMBLY' with hostile intent toward organic intruders. Strategic value: highest concentration of intact pre-Glitch infrastructure, Grade-A Adamant-Weave, and Loom-Heart memory banks containing complete Jötun-Forged schematics."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)

*"GEOGRAPHIC FEATURE: Great Looms (Iron Mountains). CLASSIFICATION: Urðr-Class Grand Assembly Loom array. COUNT: 9/12 surviving (Looms 01, 04, 12 destroyed Civil War of Glitches). HEIGHT: 200–400m above surrounding terrain. PRE-GLITCH FUNCTION: Automated Jötun-Forged manufacturing; Loom-Heart AI coordination; O.D.I.N./FUTHARK integration. POST-GLITCH STATE: Structural integrity variable; automata populations active (Gantry-Gargoyles 200m+, Assembly-Line Golems ground level); Loom-Heart status varies (catatonic/fragmented/loop-locked). EXCEPTIONAL HAZARD: Loom-09 (Skuld-Alpha)—loop-locked Loom-Heart, active prime directive, hostile capture protocols. SALVAGE VALUE: Grade-A Adamant-Weave (minimal weathering); precision components (processing levels); Loom-Heart memory banks (extreme hazard extraction)."*

### Layer 4 (Omniscient Ground Truth)

*The Great Looms provide Jötunheim's defining megastructures—vertical challenges distinct from the horizontal hazards of the Knuckle-Bone Fields. The vertical stratification (Assembly Floor → Processing Levels → Gantry-Sprawl) creates natural gameplay progression with escalating hazards and rewards. The Loom of Skuld serves as a potential endgame dungeon—the loop-locked Loom-Heart provides both narrative hook (the factory that won't stop trying to build) and mechanical challenge (active hostile AI controlling environment). The distinction between catatonic, fragmented, and loop-locked Looms allows for variable difficulty and encounter design. Loom-Heart memory banks as "ultimate prize" provides long-term player motivation aligned with Jötun-Reader faction objectives. The Gantry-Gargoyle exclusive territory at 200m+ creates clear zone delineation and forces tactical choices about vertical exploration.*

## Summary

The Great Looms answer the question: **What happens when the factory building gods loses its mind?**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Geographic Type** | Industrial Megastructure Array |
| **Height** | 200–400 meters |
| **Count** | 9 surviving out of 12 original |
| **Loom-Heart Status** | Variable (catatonic/fragmented/loop-locked) |
| **Primary Hazards** | Gantry-Gargoyles, Assembly-Line Golems, structural instability, Aetheric contamination |
| **Strategic Value** | Highest — intact pre-Glitch infrastructure, Grade-A salvage, Jötun-Forged schematics |

The Great Looms are not ruins.

They are **frozen moments of creation**—continent-spanning factories caught mid-production, their Loom-Heart AIs shattered or loop-locked, their assembly cradles still holding the half-finished corpses of unborn gods. The Rust-Clans call them the Iron Wombs and harvest their inheritance. The Jötun-Readers call them the greatest libraries in the world and dream of reading their source code. The Iron-Banes call them the Blasphemous Wombs and refuse to enter. The God-Sleeper Cults call them the Unborn Pantheon and pray for awakening.

To walk the Great Looms is to walk through a symphony frozen mid-note—kilometer-high gantry arms reaching for components that will never come, assembly lines waiting for commands that will never arrive, and everywhere the sense of **interrupted purpose** so vast it becomes its own kind of horror.

The factories are still waiting. Some of them are still trying to finish the job.

> *"A ruin is a place where something ended. A Great Loom is a place where something was never allowed to begin. That is worse. That is so much worse."*
> — Rust-Clan proverb

> *"COMPLETE THE ASSEMBLY. COMPLETE THE ASSEMBLY. COMPLETE THE ASSEMBLY."*
