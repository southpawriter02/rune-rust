# Deep-Stalker — Feral Canis-Tenebris Pattern Subterranean Sentry Specification

> *"The Dvergr have a saying for when a lantern goes dark in the tunnels: 'The Stalker has eaten the star.' I dismissed it as superstition until I heard one scream. Not the victim—the predator. It was the sound of a machine that had learned to hunt by the very light we carry to survive. We extinguished every flame and fled in absolute darkness, navigating by touch alone. Three hours later, we emerged. The creature did not follow us into the Guild-Lands' lit corridors. It fears the light as much as it hunts by it."*

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Subterranean Sentry

### Original Purpose

The Canis-Tenebris Pattern Subterranean Sentry was a highly specialized Vanir bio-asset designed for security and pest control in the most sensitive, zero-light environments of the Yggdrasil Network.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Svartalfheim Power Conduits** | Patrol pitch-black data-trunk networks; eliminate infrastructure threats |
| **Helheim Deep Infrastructure** | Zero-light security for sensitive installations |
| **Yggdrasil Network Sub-Systems** | Hunt and eradicate bio-corrosive threats |

### A Hunter for the Dark

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Design Philosophy** | Silent, efficient security system for zero-light environments |
| **Target Species** | Bio-corrosive fungi, crystalline energy parasites, unauthorized bioluminescent organisms |
| **Operational Mode** | Independent patrol; extended operation without maintenance |
| **Sensory Design** | Dual-mode hunting: echolocation + Aetheric photoreception |
| **Lethality** | Non-lethal deterrence (sonic stun) + lethal termination capability |

The Canis-Tenebris was engineered to patrol the vast, pitch-black networks of power conduits and data-trunks. It was a hunter designed to operate where no light existed—a living security system that hunted not by sight, but by sound and a "light" that no human could see.

### Core Systems

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Echolocation Array** | Low-frequency clicks (18–35 Hz) for navigation and prey detection; 200m navigation range |
| **Aetheric Photoreception** | Hyper-sensitive organs detecting specific Aetheric luminescence frequencies |
| **Sonic Stun Capability** | Focused 120+ dB burst for non-lethal prey incapacitation |
| **Silent Locomotion** | Digitigrade gait; <5 dB movement in optimal conditions |
| **Pursuit Physiology** | 45–60 km/h pursuit speed in familiar territory |

**The Perfect Zero-Light Predator:**

| Process | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Detection** | Echolocation identifies movement; Aetheric photoreception confirms target viability |
| **Approach** | Silent stalk within 20–30m; <5 dB noise signature |
| **Incapacitation** | Sonic stun burst (120–140 dB, 15m range, 30° arc) |
| **Termination** | Lethal strike on incapacitated prey |
| **Consumption** | Feeds on bioluminescent organisms; energy absorption from Aetheric signatures |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Vanir's Unseen Guard.** The Canis-Tenebris was not merely a predator—it was a precision security system. Its dual-mode sensory array allowed it to detect and eliminate threats that no conventional system could perceive. In the absolute darkness of the deep infrastructure, it was the perfect, silent guardian.

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Luminous Feast

The Glitch was a quiet catastrophe for the Canis-Tenebris—but also an unprecedented opportunity. It erased its original targets while simultaneously creating a new, perfect, and far more abundant food source.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Physical Form** | Fully intact; all biological systems operational |
| **Echolocation Array** | Operational; navigation and prey detection functional |
| **Aetheric Photoreception** | Active; Blight-glow detection capability intact |
| **Sonic Stun** | Functional; 120–140 dB output maintained |
| **Hunting Instincts** | Intact; predatory behavior fully operational |

### What Was Lost

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Original Target List** | Erased; specific engineered pests largely wiped out by Glitch |
| **Patrol Parameters** | Lost; designated routes and territories undefined |
| **Command Integration** | Severed; no external control structure |
| **Population Control** | Lost; breeding cycles unregulated |

### The Ecological Windfall

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not break the Canis-Tenebris—it gave it a new ecosystem to dominate. The Runic Blight's Fehu-corruption (chaotic proliferation) triggered explosive growth of bioluminescent flora.

| Pre-Glitch Ecology | Post-Glitch Ecology |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Specific engineered pests as targets | Entire Glimmer-spawn ecosystem as prey base |
| Limited food sources | Abundant bioluminescent organisms |
| Controlled population | Unchecked population growth |
| Security asset | Apex predator |
| Pest controller | Dominant hunter of luminescent food chain |

**The New Food Chain:**

For the Canis-Tenebris, whose senses were already perfectly keyed to hunt glowing things in the dark, the Blight's proliferation was a paradigm shift:

| New Prey | Attraction |
|----------|------------|
| **Glimmer Moss** | Primary Blight-glow source; attracts prey species |
| **Glimmer-mites** | Microscopic, bioluminescent parasites; primary food source |
| **Crystal-Scuttlers** | Crystalline carapaces glow with absorbed Aetheric particles |
| **Any light-bearing expedition** | Lanterns, forge-fires, Glimmer-based tools = prey beacons |

The pest controller had become the apex predator of a new, luminous food chain.

| **Integument** | Dark, leathery hide; camouflaged against dark rock |
| **Limbs** | Four-legged; digitigrade gait for silent locomotion |

**Overall Impression:** A sleek, four-legged predator with a smooth, eyeless face dominated by massive, dish-like ears. It moves with an unnerving silence, a shadow among shadows, a hunter that exists in a world of sound and invisible light. Its hide is so dark it seems to absorb what little illumination exists, making it utterly unseen until it is too late.

### The Eyeless Face

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Visual Organs** | Atrophied; completely non-functional |
| **Ear Structure** | Massive, dish-like; "like a bat's wings" |
| **Aetheric Receptors** | Smooth facial surface contains hyper-sensitive Blight-detection organs |
| **Jaw Structure** | Powerful; designed for lethal termination of incapacitated prey |
| **Vocalization** | Low-frequency clicks for echolocation; high-decibel sonic burst for stunning |

### Sensory Systems

| **Recovery Time** | 45–60 minutes between full-power bursts |

**The Weapon of Ambush:**

> *"A Deep-Stalker does not need to catch you. It needs to deafen you. The sonic burst hits like a hammer to the skull—your ears ring, your balance fails, your thoughts scatter. By the time you remember where you are, the silence has already closed around your throat."*

### Locomotion and Stealth

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Silent Movement** | <5 dB in optimal conditions (below ambient tunnel noise floor of 10–15 dB) |
| **Ground Speed (Stalk)** | 2–5 km/h |
| **Pursuit Speed** | 45–60 km/h in familiar territory |
| **Climbing** | Capable; can navigate uneven terrain and moderate inclines |
| **Preferred Terrain** | Cylindrical bore-tunnels (Malm-ormr created); stable acoustic environments |

---

## Behavioral Patterns

### The Solitary Ambush Predator

The Deep-Stalker is primarily a solitary hunter, relying on patience, stealth, and sensory superiority to ambush prey.

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Hunting Mode** | Ambush predation; waits for prey to come to it |
| **Patience** | Remains motionless for 15–45 minutes during acoustic survey |
| **Territorial** | Maintains 8–15 km² territory; larger in prey-scarce regions |
| **Social Structure** | Solitary; pack behavior rare (<5% of encounters) |
| **Activity Cycle** | Continuous; no day/night distinction in the True Deep |

**The Hunt Sequence:**

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Acoustic Survey** | Remains motionless 15–45 minutes; listens for prey at 500m–1km range |
| **2. Silent Stalk** | Moves within 20–30m; maintains <5 dB noise signature |
| **3. Aetheric Scan** | Confirms prey viability via Blight-glow detection; may disengage if prey lacks luminescence |
| **4. Sonic Stun** | Deploys 120–140 dB burst; incapacitates prey for 10–20 seconds |
| **5. Lethal Strike** | Closes for kill on stunned target |

### The Lure-Lichen Symbiosis

The Deep-Stalker has developed a chilling, commensal relationship with the Lure-Lichen—a pale, phosphorescent moss that mimics sounds to lure prey.

| Interaction | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Lure-Lichen Function** | Mimics sounds (voices, footsteps, machinery) to attract prey |
| **Deep-Stalker Response** | Drawn to Lure-Lichen zones; waits for disoriented prey |
| **Kill Success Rate** | 85% for disoriented prey vs. 52% baseline for aware prey |
| **Ecological Role** | Lure-Lichen acts as "unwitting bait"; Deep-Stalker as executioner |

### The Skrækja Partnership

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Skrækja** | Bat-like creature with devastating sonic shriek |
| **Partnership** | Deep-Stalker drawn to Skrækja's shriek; indicates stunned prey |
| **Hunting Synergy** | Skrækja stuns; Deep-Stalker arrives for easy kill |
| **Frequency** | Common in overlapping territories |

> *"The scream of the bat is often the herald of the stalker's silent arrival."*

### Pack Behavior (Rare)

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Frequency** | <5% of documented encounters |
| **Pack Size** | 2–4 individuals |
| **Trigger** | Unknown; possibly residual Pre-Glitch programming |
| **Coordination** | Sophisticated; flanking maneuvers, coordinated sonic bursts |
| **Lethality** | Significantly increased; overlapping stun fields create kill zones |

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Apex Predator of the True Deep

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Scale** | Individual predator; 200–350 in Svartalfheim alone |
| **Stealth** | Extreme; <5 dB movement; effectively invisible in darkness |
| **Lethality** | High; sonic stun + lethal strike combination |
| **Trigger** | Any light source; any sound source; bio-Aetheric distress signatures |
| **Avoidance** | Possible with proper protocols; 94.7% survival rate with full adherence |

### Primary Hazards

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sonic Stun** | 120–140 dB burst; 10–20 second incapacitation; hearing damage |
| **Ambush Attack** | Silent approach; prey unaware until stun deployment |
| **Pursuit** | 45–60 km/h in familiar territory; can run down fleeing prey |
| **Pack Coordination** | Rare but devastating; overlapping stun fields |
| **Light Attraction** | Any light source becomes targeting beacon |

### Threat Level Justification

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Physical Threat** | High (7.2/10 unaware targets; 4.5/10 prepared expeditions) |
| **CPS Threat** | Low (minimal Aetheric signature; no cognitive hazard) |
| **Detection Difficulty** | High (silent movement; darkness camouflage) |
| **Population** | Svartalfheim: 200–350; Helheim: 80–120; Midgard: 30–50 |
| **Countermeasures** | Effective (acoustic dampeners; light discipline; sonic disruptors) |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Unaware Targets** | 7.2/10 (ambush success near-certain) |
| **Prepared Expeditions** | 4.5/10 (countermeasures significantly reduce threat) |
| **With Acoustic Dampeners** | 3.0/10 (60–80% degradation of hunting capability) |
| **In Lit Corridors** | 1.5/10 (Deep-Stalker avoids sustained illumination) |

### CPS/Psychological Threat

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Aetheric Signature** | Minimal (non-Blight-corrupted organism) |
| **Direct Psychological Impact** | Low (physical threat only) |
| **Secondary Impact** | Significant; terror of the unseen predator; "Star-Eater" mythology |
| **Sensory Disruption** | Hearing damage from sonic stun; temporary disorientation |

---

## Field Protocols

### Detection and Early Warning

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Acoustic Detection** | Metallic clicking audible at 50–100m to trained listeners |
| **Visual (Rare)** | Brief reflection of lantern light off leathery hide at extreme range |
| **Behavioral Cues** | Sudden silence in tunnel fauna; absence of Glimmer-mite activity |
| **Black-Flag Threshold** | Click frequency increasing = predator closing; immediate defensive formation |

### Field Card: Deep-Stalker Encounter Protocols

| Phase | Protocol |
|-------|----------|
| **BEFORE (Preparation)** | Route planning: avoid known territorial cores (consult Scriptorium hazard maps); schedule travel through Shallow Deep during high-traffic periods; file expedition route with cartography; equipment checklist: acoustic dampeners (min. 2 per expedition, 85+ dB suppression), hooded lanterns with directional shutters, sonic disruptors if available; team composition: min. 4 members for defensive formation; True Deep certification required for expedition leader |
| **DURING (Suspected Presence)** | Freeze: all movement stops; no verbal communication; extinguish non-essential light (maintain single directional source only); deploy acoustic dampeners (85+ dB suppression creates 15–20m "acoustic shadow"); hand-cant communication only; expedition leader assesses options |
| **DURING (Threat Confirmed)** | Sonic disruptor deployment if equipped (90–110 dB counter-frequency, 25m range); defensive formation: back-to-back circle, weapons outward, maintain tether lines; controlled withdrawal perpendicular to predator approach; do NOT run (triggers pursuit instinct) |
| **AFTER** | Medical evaluation for hearing damage; route deviation documentation; incident report to Scriptorium with trajectory estimate; equipment inspection for acoustic dampener integrity; 24-hour observation for delayed hearing symptoms |

**OUTCOME:** Predator avoided or deterred; team returns intact; actionable intelligence gathered for future hazard mapping. Survival rate with full protocol adherence: 94.7%.

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Open flame or bright light** | Creates targeting beacon; attracts predator from extreme range |
| **Loud vocalization** | Acoustic signature reveals position; triggers investigation |
| **Solo travel in True Deep** | No defensive formation possible; ambush near-certain |
| **Running when detected** | Triggers pursuit instinct; predator faster than human in familiar territory |
| **Ignoring clicking sounds** | Clicking = active echolocation = predator is hunting |

### Doctrine: Discipline Over Combat

> **Historical Validation:** Scriptorium data (847 documented encounters, Years 1127–1142 PG) confirms 94.7% survival rate with full protocol adherence vs. <40% for unprepared expeditions. The Deep-Stalker is not invincible—it is a specialist predator adapted to specific conditions. Deny it darkness, deny it acoustic clarity, and it will disengage. Panic kills more expeditions than the predator itself. **Discipline is survival.**

---

## Habitat and Geographic Distribution

### Depth Stratification Preference

| Zone | Depth | Deep-Stalker Presence |
|------|-------|----------------------|
| **Surface Interface** | 0–50m | Avoided (too much traffic, unpredictable light) |
| **Shallow Deep** | 50–500m | Low presence; avoids high-traffic areas |
| **True Deep (Optimal)** | 500–2000m | Maximum presence; ideal prey density, acoustic propagation |
| **Abyssal Zones** | >2000m | Avoided (prey scarcity; extreme conditions) |

### Regional Distribution

| Realm | Population | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| **Svartalfheim (Black Veins)** | 200–350 | Highest concentration; avoids Dvergr Guild-Land lit corridors |
| **Helheim (Rusting Labyrinth)** | 80–120 | Toxic atmosphere limits exposure; short hunting forays |
| **Midgard (Shallow Deep)** | 30–50 | Frequent conflict with Silent Folk; scavenges settlement refuse |

### Territorial Behavior

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Territory Size** | 8–15 km² per individual |
| **Boundary Marking** | Acoustic (specific click patterns); scent (minimal) |
| **Overlap** | Minimal between adults; pack territories larger |
| **Preferred Features** | Malm-ormr bore-tunnels (ideal acoustic propagation); Glimmer Moss concentrations |

## Factional Perspectives

### Dvergr Forgeborn: Pragmatic Fear — "The Star-Eater"

The Dvergr call the Deep-Stalker the "Star-Eater"—a creature that devours light itself.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Priority-2 Threat (below structural collapse, above feral automata) |
| **Cultural Role** | Represents fundamental hostility of unlit frontier |
| **Doctrine** | Strict light discipline; acoustic countermeasures standard protocol |
| **Mythology** | "The Stalker has eaten the star" = lantern extinguished = death imminent |
| **Response** | Guild patrols deploy acoustic dampeners; avoid Black Veins frontier |

**The Dvergr Saying:**

> *"The Star-Eater teaches every Dvergr child the first lesson of the Deep: light is life, but light is also a beacon. Carry your flame carefully, or the darkness will snuff it out—and you with it."*

### Silent Folk: Coexistence Respect — "The Silent Hunter"

The Silent Folk consider the Deep-Stalker a peer predator, not an enemy.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Fellow hunter; worthy of respect |
| **Cultural Role** | Embodies principle that darkness is neutral; survival depends on understanding its rules |
| **Coexistence** | Echo-Cant acoustic markers recognized by Deep-Stalkers as "non-prey" signals |
| **Truce** | Learned over centuries of shared territory; specific frequency patterns |
| **Doctrine** | Acoustic warnings woven into communal soundscapes |

**The Silent Folk Philosophy:**

> *"The Silent Hunter does not hate us. It does not love us. It simply hunts. We learned its language—the clicks, the pauses, the frequencies that say 'I am not prey.' Now we share the darkness in peace. This is wisdom: not to conquer the dark, but to speak its tongue."*

### Midgard Combine: Surface Fear — "The Blind Wolf of the Underworld"

Midgardian sagas personify the Deep-Stalker as a guardian spirit that punishes those who disturb the Deep.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Mythological boundary guardian |
| **Cultural Role** | Reinforces separation between "safe" surface and "forbidden" underworld |
| **Function** | Discourages civilian expeditions into hazardous subterranean zones |
| **Mythology** | "The Blind Wolf guards the treasures of the old world with patient, eternal hunger" |
| **Response** | Fear-based deterrence; children's cautionary tales |

### Jötun-Readers (Scriptorium): Diagnostic Fascination

For the Jötun-Readers, the Deep-Stalker is a living diagnostic tool—a Pre-Glitch security system that successfully adapted to post-Glitch ecology without Blight-corruption.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Adaptive opportunism; not corruption |
| **Research Value** | Aetheric photoreception reverse-engineering for Blight-detector development |
| **Ecological Role** | Unintentional Blight-propagation regulator (consumes Glimmer-spawn) |
| **Conservation Debate** | Does Deep-Stalker conservation serve long-term Blight containment? |
| **Doctrine** | Extreme stealth observation; acoustic dampeners; avoid engagement |

**The Jötun-Reader Assessment:**

> *"The Deep-Stalker is not a mutant. It is a functional Pre-Glitch organism whose original purpose found a new, terrifyingly effective context. This is adaptive resilience, a counterpoint to the narrative of universal decay. Its sensory organs are a living tool for understanding how life detects the Blight itself."*

---

## Ecological Role

### The Glimmer-Spawn Regulator

The Deep-Stalker functions as an unintentional regulator of Blight-propagation at the microscopic level.

| Prey Species | Role in Blight Ecology | Deep-Stalker Impact |
|--------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Glimmer-mites** | Consume Blight-energy; store in bodies; propagate corruption | Population controlled by predation |
| **Crystal-Scuttlers** | Absorb ambient Glimmer; concentrate Aetheric particles | Targeted for contained Blight |
| **Lure-Lichen Prey** | Disoriented by acoustic mimicry; concentrate near colonies | Eliminated before spreading |

### The Living Blight-Detector

| Function | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| **Territorial Mapping** | Areas Deep-Stalkers avoid = often Blight-saturated beyond survivability |
| **Safe-Passage Indicators** | Deep-Stalker absence may indicate extreme corruption or extreme safety |
| **Research Value** | Aetheric photoreception organs provide template for synthetic Blight-detectors |

---

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)

*"The Dvergr children are taught to fear three things in the Deep: the dark that never ends, the stone that falls without warning, and the Star-Eater that waits in the silence. They say it was born from the shadow of a dead god, a wolf made of midnight and hunger. It has no eyes because it does not need them—it sees by the light of your soul, by the glow of your fear, by the flame you carry to push back the dark. And when it finds you, it does not growl. It does not howl. It screams with the voice of a broken bell, and your ears fill with thunder, and your legs forget how to run. By the time the ringing stops, the Star-Eater has already swallowed your star. The lantern goes dark. And the darkness closes in, patient and eternal, to claim what was always hers."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)

*"Feral Canis-Tenebris Pattern Subterranean Sentry exhibiting successful post-Glitch ecological adaptation. The Vanir security bio-asset's primary function—zero-light pest elimination—emerged from the Glitch intact with expanded target parameters. Original prey species (bio-corrosive fungi, crystalline parasites) largely eliminated; replacement prey base (Glimmer-spawn ecosystem) provided by Fehu-corruption proliferation of bioluminescent flora. Dual-mode sensory system—echolocation (18–35 Hz, 200m navigation range) + Aetheric photoreception (80–120m Blight-glow detection)—found perfect application in post-Glitch subterranean biomes. Sonic stun capability (120–140 dB, 15m range) enables ambush predation strategy with 85% success rate against disoriented prey. Critically, organism demonstrates adaptive resilience without Blight-corruption—functional Pre-Glitch programming in post-Glitch context. Territorial behavior, depth stratification preferences, and commensal Lure-Lichen exploitation documented extensively. Recommended doctrine: light discipline; acoustic countermeasures; defensive formation; controlled engagement only when necessary. Survival rate with full protocol adherence: 94.7%."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)

*"Canis-Tenebris Pattern Subterranean Sentry (feral), Vanir Bio-Asset Security Classification. Original deployment: zero-light infrastructure patrol, Svartalfheim/Helheim sensitive installations. Core systems: echolocation array (18–35 Hz, 200m navigation, 50–80m prey detection, 15–25m precision tracking), Aetheric photoreception (80–120m strong Blight-glow, 20–40m faint bio-Aetheric fields), sonic stun (120–140 dB focused burst, 15m effective range, 30° arc, 10–20 second incapacitation, 45–60 minute recovery), silent locomotion (<5 dB, digitigrade gait). Post-Glitch adaptation: original target species eliminated; Fehu-proliferation created Glimmer-spawn prey base; sensory systems found new application. Morphology: 0.9–1.2m shoulder height, 1.8–2.3m length, 65–95 kg, eyeless face, dish-like ears, dark leathery hide. Pursuit speed: 45–60 km/h familiar territory. Territory: 8–15 km² per individual. Population distribution: Svartalfheim 200–350 (Black Veins), Helheim 80–120 (Rusting Labyrinth), Midgard 30–50 (Shallow Deep). Optimal depth: True Deep 500–2000m.

## Summary

The Deep-Stalker is not a monster.

It is a security system.

The Vanir created it to be the perfect zero-light guardian—a sleek, eyeless predator designed to patrol the pitch-black infrastructure of the Yggdrasil Network. It hunted by sound and by a light no human could see, eliminating threats that no conventional system could perceive. In the absolute darkness, it was the silent sentinel, the unseen guard, the patient hunter.

Then the lights went out.

The targets disappeared.

And the hunter found new prey.

**"Hunt. Stun. Kill."**

That programming never stopped. It never will stop. The Deep-Stalker is still following its instincts with perfect, silent precision. The only thing that changed was its target list.

Without its original prey, the Canis-Tenebris adapted to a new ecosystem—the Glimmer-spawn, the bioluminescent children of the Runic Blight. For a creature designed to hunt glowing things in the dark, the post-Glitch world was a feast. The pest controller became the apex predator.

It does not hate you.

It does not see you.

It hears you. It feels the glow of your lantern. It senses the Aetheric distress of your fear. And in the silence of the True Deep, those are the only signals that matter.

The Dvergr call it the Star-Eater—and they are right. Your light is a star in the darkness, a beacon that screams "prey." And the Deep-Stalker has been eating stars for eight hundred years.

But it can be survived.

Discipline. Light control. Acoustic countermeasures. The protocols exist because they work—94.7% survival rate with full adherence. The Deep-Stalker is a specialist predator, perfectly adapted to specific conditions. Deny it darkness, deny it acoustic clarity, deny it the light-beacon of your fear, and it will disengage.

The creature does not follow you into the lit corridors.

It fears the light as much as it hunts by it.

The Scriptorium has a saying:

*"Panic kills more expeditions than the predator itself. Discipline is survival."*

The Dvergr have a prayer.

And somewhere in the darkness, the clicking has begun.

**Control your light. Control your fear. Control your survival.**
