**Challenge:** "Power Station" (Technical Room Function)
**Translation:** "Spark-Hall"
**Why:** "Power" implies utility and control. "Spark" implies something elemental, fleeting, and dangerous. "Hall" gives it a sense of place and grandeur, fitting for a "cathedral of the thinking-stones".

## 2026-01-22 - Purifying the Water
**Challenge:** "Water Treatment" (Technical Room Function)
**Translation:** "Purification Vault"
**Why:** "Treatment" is a medical or chemical term. "Purification" is ritualistic. "Vault" suggests the water is treasured or imprisoned.
