## Description

You chant a low, grinding dirge in the corrupted tongue of the Blight, creating a persistent vortex of decay. This is not merely accelerated corrosion—this is a zone where the fundamental bonds holding matter together begin to fail. Machines caught in this maelstrom are torn apart at the molecular level.

## Mechanics

### Action Economy

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Action Cost** | Standard Action (1 turn chant) |
| **Resource Cost** | 65 Aether |
| **Targeting** | One row (Front or Back) |
| **Duration** | 3 turns |
| **Corruption Cost** | +3 Runic Blight Corruption |

### Chant Phase (Turn 1)

- Declare Blight of Iron, spend turn chanting
- Cannot move or take other actions
- **Vulnerable to interruption** (if attacked, WILL check or lose chant)

### Zone Effect (Turns 2-4)

| Enemy Type | Damage |
| --- | --- |
| Standard/Organic | 3d6 Arcane per turn |
| **Mechanical/Undying** | **6d6 Arcane per turn** |
- Triggers at start of each enemy's turn in zone
- Zone persists even if you move or die

---

## Tactical Applications

### Boss Fights

- Chant when boss is locked down by controller
- 3 turns of 6d6 damage = **18d6 total** to mechanical bosses
- Forces boss to choose: stay and take damage, or reposition

### Risks

- Interruption during chant wastes Aether and turn
- Requires tank protection during vulnerable chant turn

## Integration Notes

- **Anti-Machine Ultimate:** Devastating vs Undying/Mechanical compositions
- **Zone Dominance:** Best persistent damage zone in your kit
- **Stacks with [Corroded]:** Zone damage + DoT = compound devastation
