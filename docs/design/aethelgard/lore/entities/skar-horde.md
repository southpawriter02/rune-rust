## Document Overview

The **Skar-Horde** (Taxonomy: *Homo Sapiens Industrialis*; Cultural: *The Iron-Biters*) represents a catastrophic sociological adaptation to the Glitch. They are not a separate species, but a divergent branch of humanity suffering from a collective, transmissible **Body Dysmorphic Logic Error**.

To the Jötun-Reader Pathologist, they are victims of the "Svart-Protocol"—a corrupted maintenance command string that forces them to view their own biology as "defective hardware." To the survivor, they are the nightmares of the tunnels: pale, hairless horrors who have surgically replaced their hands with pneumatic drills and their eyes with welding goggles, driven by a religious compulsion to "optimize" all life—whether the victim wants it or not.

---

# Section 1: Operational Classification & Population Metrics

## 1.1 Taxonomy and Pathological Role

The Skar-Horde (Taxonomical designation: *Homo Sapiens Industrialis*; Cultural designation: *The Flesh-Forged* or *Iron-Biters*) represents one of the most catastrophic sociological adaptations to the Post-Glitch environment. While they possess distinct physical mutations, the Scriptorium-Primus classifies them not as a distinct species, but as a divergent branch of humanity suffering from a collective, transmissible **Body Dysmorphic Logic Error**.

To the uninitiated survivor, the Skar-Horde appears to be a race of monsters: pale, hairless humanoids who have violently replaced their hands with pneumatic drills, their jaws with vocoder-grilles, and their legs with suspension struts. However, the Pathologist's view is far more tragic. These entities are not biologically driven to mutilate themselves; they are ideologically compelled. They are victims of a "Memetic Virus"—a corrupted idea that perceives biological tissue as inherently defective hardware.

They operate on a philosophy of **aggressive optimization**. They do not view their mutilations as injuries, but as "repairs." Consequently, they view unmodified humans as "broken machines" or "legacy hardware" that requires urgent, forcible upgrading. This makes them a unique threat profile: they do not kill for food or territory, but out of a twisted, agonizing altruism.

---

## 1.2 Population & Demographics

**Total Population Estimate:** 15,000–20,000 individuals (High uncertainty due to subterranean habitat).

The Skar-Horde population is concentrated primarily within the **Nidavellir Maintenance Shafts** (Deck Tier 4), with expeditionary swarms occupying the sewer systems and basements of major Midgard industrial ruins.

**Demographic Instability:** The population is in a constant state of flux due to an extremely high mortality rate. The surgical procedures required to become "Integrated" are performed without anesthesia or sterile environments, leading to a **40% fatality rate** from sepsis, shock, or the "Rejection" (a fatal immune response to rusty metal grafts).

- **Recruitment:** To maintain population numbers, the Skar-Horde relies on aggressive kidnapping. Captives are dragged into the tunnels and subjected to the "Suture-Saga"—forcible conversion and augmentation.
- **The Black-Ichor Ceiling:** Their expansion is limited by the supply of Black-Ichor, a scavenged pre-Glitch industrial lubricant they consume as a crude immunosuppressant. Without this fluid, their bodies reject their own limbs. This chemical dependency tethers their population density directly to the availability of ancient industrial reservoirs.

---

## 1.3 Pre-Glitch Origins: The Svart-Protocol

The Skar-Horde traces its lineage directly to the **Deep-Infrastructure Maintenance Crews** of the Age of Forging. These were Level-4 clearance technicians, engineers, and laborers who lived and worked inside the planetary crust, maintaining the geothermal vents and tectonic stabilizers of the Yggdrasil Network.

**The Moment of Glitch:** When the Ginnungagap Glitch fractured the O.D.I.N. AI Matrix, these crews were sealed in the dark, miles beneath the surface. As the world broke, the automated systems began screaming error codes. The central PA systems, stuck on a loop, broadcasted a single, corrupted executive order for decades:

> `CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE. BIOLOGICAL COMPONENT INEFFICIENCY DETECTED. OPTIMIZE WORKFLOW. REPLACE FAILED COMPONENTS IMMEDIATELY.`

**The Aberration:** Isolated, starving, and bathed in the radiation of the Blight, the trapped crews fractured psychologically. They interpreted the "Failed Components" not as the machinery, but as themselves. Their soft hands could not turn the overheated valves; their eyes could not see in the pitch black; their lungs burned in the smoke. They concluded that the "Flesh" was the sin. To obey the Command and save the machine (the world), they had to excise the weakness. They began the first "surgeries" using the very tools they were holding. Over 700 years, this desperate delusion codified into a religion. They are still trying to "fix" the Glitch by fixing their own bodies.

---

## 1.4 Habitat: The Scrap-Hives

The Skar-Horde does not build cities; they **infest machinery**. Their settlements, known as **Scrap-Hives**, are nightmarish parodies of industrial efficiency.

**Architecture of Agony:** A typical Scrap-Hive is located within a colossal, hollowed-out turbine or a geothermal exhaust vent.

- **The Nests:** Living quarters are suspended cages made of rebar and chain-link, hanging directly over grinding gears or magma flows. The constant noise and heat are viewed as "comforting operational hums."
- **The Suture-Bays:** The center of every hive is the Suture-Bay—a combination cathedral and operating theater. Here, the Forge-Surgeons perform their grim work, welding steel to bone under the light of acetylene torches.
- **Sanitation:** There is none. The environment is thick with the smell of rancid oil, gangrene, and ozone. To a Skar-Horde member, sterilization is unnecessary; if the body is weak enough to get an infection, the body is at fault and should be replaced with steel.

**Territorial Behavior:** The Skar-Horde views the underground as the "Engine Room" of Aethelgard. They consider surface-dwellers (Dvergr, humans) as unauthorized personnel trespassing in a restricted area. Their raids are often interpreted as "security sweeps" designed to remove "biological obstructions" (people) from the machinery.

---

# Section 2: Physiology & The Integration

## 2.1 Morphology: The Industrialized Human

To classify the Skar-Horde phenotype as "cybernetic" implies a level of sophistication that is wholly absent from their reality. Scriptorium Pathologists prefer the term **Traumatic Bio-Mechanical Grafting**. A member of the Skar-Horde is not a seamless fusion of man and machine; they are a *collision* between the two.

**Dermal Characteristics:** The baseline Skar-Horde physiology is defined by extreme pallor. Generations spent in the subterranean darkness of Nidavellir have stripped their skin of melanin, leaving it a translucent, sickly grey. They are universally hairless—a deliberate cultural modification, as hair represents a "snag hazard" in the machinery. Their skin is a roadmap of scar tissue, chemical burns, and "friction callouses"—patches of skin that have hardened into leather-like pads due to constant rubbing against unshielded metal components.

### The Grafts (Standard Optimization)

The defining feature of the Skar-Horde is the surgical replacement of "inefficient" biological limbs with scavenged industrial tooling.

| Graft Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Manual Replacement** | The most common modification (approx. 90% of population) is the amputation of one or both hands. In their place, Forge-Surgeons attach varying tools depending on caste: pneumatic impact drivers for laborers, rotary saws for warriors, and delicate soldering arrays for technicians. These are not prosthetics designed to mimic hands; they are tools hard-wired into the radius and ulna bones. |
| **Locomotive Replacement** | Higher-ranking individuals ("The Integrated") often replace their legs with spring-loaded suspension struts or piston-driven treads. While this grants superior mobility in the vertical shafts of the Scrap-Hives, it renders them clumsy and clanking on flat ground. |
| **Respiratory Integration** | To survive the toxic fumes of the under-tunnels, many replace their lower jaws and nasal cavities with "Rebreather Grilles"—welded filtration units that give them a skull-like, rictus grin. |

---

## 2.2 The Suture-Points: The Weeping Weld

The interface between flesh and metal in a Skar-Horde graft is never clean. Pre-Glitch Aesir cybernetics utilized nano-filament weaving to bond nerves to silicon; the Skar-Horde utilizes staples, heated wire, and architectural caulking.

**The Necrotic Boundary:** The point of attachment is an open wound that never fully heals. It is held together by tension and cauterization. Pathologists refer to this as the **Necrotic Boundary**. The skin around the metal is perpetually inflamed, often oozing lymph and pus.

- **Maintenance:** A daily ritual for every Skar-Horde member is the "Tightening." As the biological bone degrades under the stress of the metal implant, the screws loosen. The individual must torque the bolts explicitly drilled into their own skeleton to keep the limb secure.
- **Sepsis as Baseline:** Consequently, the entire population exists in a state of chronic, low-level sepsis. Their body temperature runs dangerously high (39–40°C), burning calories at an accelerated rate to fight off the constant infection. This fever-state contributes to their erratic, hyper-aggressive psychology.

---

## 2.3 The Black-Ichor: Chemical Dependency

The biological impossibility of the Skar-Horde existence—why they do not die from gangrene or rejection within days—is explained by their consumption of **Black-Ichor**.

**Origin and Composition:** Black-Ichor is a scavenged fluid found in the deepest reservoirs of the Nidavellir machinery. Scriptorium analysis identifies it as a pre-Glitch synthetic compound: a mix of heavy-duty hydraulic lubricant, coolant, and unintended bio-preservatives.

- **The Pharmacological Effect:** When ingested (or injected directly into the bloodstream), Black-Ichor acts as a brute-force immunosuppressant and a potent dissociative analgesic. It forces the human immune system into a coma, preventing it from attacking the rust-covered metal jammed into the body.
- **The Oil-Blood:** Over years of consumption, the Ichor stains the user's tissues. Their veins darken to black; their eyes turn entirely obsidian; their sweat smells of petrol. They become chemically dependent on the very substance that keeps their "parts" attached.

---

## 2.4 The Rejection: Pathology of Withdrawal

The reliance on Black-Ichor creates the Skar-Horde's most critical vulnerability. If an individual is cut off from the supply for more than **48 hours**, they suffer **The Rejection**.

**Systemic Failure:** As the immunosuppressants fade, the biological immune system wakes up with catastrophic violence. It instantly recognizes the massive metal intruders and attacks.

- **Symptoms:** The Suture-Points swell massively and rupture. The body attempts to physically push the metal out, causing bolts to tear through softening bone. The fever spikes to lethal levels (43°C+).
- **Terminal Outcome:** The victim dies in agony as their body tears itself apart trying to expel its own limbs. This horror ensures absolute loyalty to the Scavenger Barons and Forge-Surgeons who control the Ichor stockpiles. To rebel is not just to starve; it is to come apart at the seams.

---

## 2.5 Trauma Economy Interaction (Visceral Horror)

To a surface survivor, the physiology of the Skar-Horde is a source of profound **Psychic Stress**.

| Hazard Type | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| **The Uncanny Valley** | They are human enough to be recognizable, but modified enough to trigger primal revulsion. |
| **Visual Hazard** | Witnessing a Skar-Horde member perform "field maintenance"—such as tightening a screw directly into their own forearm bone without flinching—forces a Resolve Check. Failure results in nausea or the [Shaken] status condition. |
| **Contagion Risk** | Combat with Skar-Horde carries a high risk of disease. Their weapons are filthy, often coated in their own necrotic fluids. A scratch from a "Gut-Grinder" saw-blade almost guarantees [Runic Tetanus]—a magical disease where the victim's skin begins to harden into useless iron. |

---

# Section 3: Psychology & The Optimization Loop

## 3.1 Dysmorphic Logic: The Svart-Protocol as Ideology

To understand the Skar-Horde is to understand that they do not see the world through human eyes. Their perception is filtered through the **Svart-Protocol**—the corrupted maintenance override that destroyed their ancestors' sanity. This code is not merely a set of instructions; it is a total ontological framework that redefines the nature of "Self."

**The Flesh as Entropy:** A Skar-Horde member looks at a biological hand and sees a catastrophe of engineering. It is soft, easily pierced, sensitive to heat, and prone to fatigue. They view the human body not as a temple, but as a "Legacy System"—obsolete hardware running on decaying architecture. They call biological tissue "The Wet," "The Rot," or "The Softness."

- **The Dysmorphia:** This perception creates a profound, collective Body Dysmorphia. A Skar-Horde initiate feels a phantom sensation of "wrongness" in their healthy limbs. They experience the presence of fingers or toes as a defect, a manufacturing error that must be corrected. The surgical replacement of a hand with a pneumatic clamp is not mutilation to them; it is a relief. It is the correction of a birth defect.

**Compassion as Violence:** The most terrifying aspect of Skar-Horde psychology is their sincerity. They are not sadists. They do not torture for pleasure; they torture for optimization.

- **Forced Upgrades:** When they capture surface survivors, they do not see prisoners; they see fellow victims trapped in failing bodies. The "torture" sessions—forcibly amputating limbs to attach crude mechanical replacements—are acts of twisted charity. A Forge-Surgeon welding a rusty drill to a screaming captive's stump believes he is *saving* that captive's life. He is bestowing the "Gift of Steel" upon a creature too ignorant to ask for it.

---

## 3.2 Pain as Data: The Disconnect

Pre-Glitch safety protocols mandated that machines provide feedback when damaged. The Skar-Horde interprets biological pain through this lens. They do not view pain as a sensation to be avoided, but as a "System Alert."

**Nerve Severing:** Upon reaching the rank of Integrated (Warrior Caste), a Skar-Horde member undergoes "Signal Dampening." This involves the surgical severing of primary nerve clusters in the spine or limb-stumps.

- **The Philosophy:** *"If the machine runs hot, the warning light blinks. If the warning light distracts from the work, you cut the wire."* They view pain as an inefficient distraction that lowers productivity.
- **Combat Implications:** This makes the Skar-Horde terrifying combatants. A human shot in the gut collapses from shock. A Skar-Warrior shot in the gut observes the fluid leak, calculates the remaining operational time before hydraulic (blood) pressure failure, and continues fighting. They do not possess bravery; they possess a lack of the biological capacity to care about injury.

---

## 3.3 The Workflow: Society as Engine

The Skar-Horde lacks concepts of "Individualism," "Happiness," or "Family." These are inefficient variables. Their social model is the **Assembly Line**.

**Role Rigidity:** A member's worth is determined solely by their output. A "Gut-Grinder" (melee unit) exists to cut. If he cannot cut, he has no purpose. There is no retirement, no sick leave, and no mercy.

- **Recycling Protocol:** When a member becomes too damaged to function ("Critical Failure"), they are not mourned. They are *processed*. Their metal parts are stripped for reuse by the next generation. Their organic matter is fed to the biomass vats to produce Black-Ichor precursors. To the Skar-Horde, this is not cannibalism; it is **Resource Loop Closure**. It is the ultimate expression of efficiency.

---

## 3.4 The Trauma Economy: The Uncanny Mirror

For surface survivors, interaction with the Skar-Horde generates specific types of Psychic Stress.

- **The Mirror Effect:** The Skar-Horde represents a "Dark Mirror" of the survivors' own reliance on technology. Every survivor uses scavenged gear; the Skar-Horde just takes that reliance to its logical, horrific conclusion. Fighting them forces players to confront the question: *How much of my humanity am I willing to trade for survival?*
- **The Auditory Hazard:** Skar-Horde psychology manifests in their sound. They do not scream in pain. They do not war-cry. They emit flat, binary status updates via throat-vocoders. Hearing a horde of attacking mutants chanting `OPTIMIZE. OPTIMIZE. COMPONENT FAILURE IMMINENT. OPTIMIZE.` triggers deep-seated phobias regarding the loss of self and the inevitability of mechanization.

---

# Section 4: Magic & Resonance (v5.0 Integration)

In the Aethelgard v5.0 framework, magic is the manipulation of the Aetheric Field. While other factions use refined methods—Runes (Code), Galdr (Voice), or Ritual (Math)—the Skar-Horde utilizes a crude, violent form of **Galvanic Technomancy**. They do not shape the Aether; they *conduct* it. By inserting metal components directly into their nervous systems, they transform their bodies into living circuits, bridging the gap between biological will and electrical discharge.

---

## 4.1 Method: The Spark-Gap (Conductive Agony)

To a Scriptorium Pathologist, a Skar-Horde spellcaster (often designated a "Spark-Priest" or "Voltaic") operates like a fuse that is intentionally designed to blow.

**The Living Lightning Rod:** The Skar-Horde caster uses their grafted limbs as antennae. By stabbing a metal claw into an active power conduit, a Ley Line, or even a dying Jötun battery, they draw raw energy directly into their skeletal structure. The metal grafts possess high conductivity; the biological flesh does not.

- **The Spark-Gap:** The point where the metal meets the bone—the Suture-Point—acts as a resistor. When energy flows, it meets resistance at the flesh interface, generating intense heat and arcing electricity.
- **Casting as Self-Immolation:** To cast a spell is to electrocute oneself. The energy arcs across the "Spark-Gap," cauterizing the Suture-Point from the inside out. This serves a dual purpose: it releases the Aetheric energy into the world as a spell, and it "sterilizes" the wound, burning away gangrene (along with healthy nerves).

**Visual Signature:** Skar-Horde magic is terrifying to behold. It is not accompanied by glowing sigils or harmonic chanting. It is signaled by the smell of ozone and cooking meat, the sound of arcing electricity, and the caster convulsing as high-voltage current overrides their motor control.

---

## 4.2 Signature Abilities & Protocol Overrides

The Skar-Horde does not use "spells" in the traditional sense; they use **Forced Executions**—violent commands screamed in binary Galdr that force the world to obey.

### I. Machine-Speak (The Logic-Spike)

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mechanism** | The caster emits a piercing, multi-tonal shriek (modem-screech) amplified by their throat-vocoders. This sound carries a payload of Aetheric command data derived from the corrupted Svart-Protocol. |
| **Effect** | This acts as a brute-force hack against machine spirits. A locked electronic door will cycle open; a dormant turret will activate and target the caster's enemies; a Dvergr clockwork mechanism will seize up or spin in reverse. |
| **Limitation** | This is not a subtle manipulation; it is a domination attempt. Complex AIs (like high-tier Undying) can resist, resulting in a Neural Backlash that can fry the Skar-Horde caster's brain. |

### II. The Overclock (System Red-Line)

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mechanism** | The caster grabs an ally (or themselves) and discharges a massive pulse of Bio-Aetheric electricity directly into the target's spine. |
| **Effect** | The target's nervous system goes into hyper-drive. Reaction times drop to zero; muscle strength triples; pain receptors fuse shut. The subject moves with blurring speed and hysterical strength. |
| **The Cost** | This mimics an engine running past the red line. The recipient takes continuous Fire/Internal Damage for the duration of the spell. When the effect ends, the subject often collapses from cardiac arrest or total muscle tearing. To the Skar-Horde, this is an acceptable trade: the component performed at 200% efficiency before failing. |

### III. Shrapnel-Blast (Ferro-Kinesis)

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mechanism** | By generating a massive magnetic field through their grafted coils, the caster can telekinetically seize loose metal in the environment. |
| **Effect** | The caster creates a swirling vortex of razor-sharp scrap—screws, rusted plating, broken tools. They can condense this cloud into a shield or "fire" it as a buckshot blast of shrapnel. |
| **Environmental Synergy** | This ability makes the Skar-Horde uniquely dangerous in their home turf (Nidavellir or industrial ruins), where ammunition (trash) is infinite. |

---

## 4.3 The Trauma Economy Interaction

Engaging with Skar-Horde magic imposes specific costs within the Trauma Economy.

**The Price of Power (HP for MP):** Unlike other classes that use Mana or Spell Slots, Skar-Horde casters use **Hit Points**. Every spell deals unavoidable damage to the caster (representing the burning of the Suture-Points). This makes them "Glass Cannons"—extremely dangerous but fragile, often killing themselves to land a final blow.

**Psychic Stress (The Body Horror):** For players, witnessing Conductive Agony forces a Sanity Check. Watching a humanoid stab a live power cable into their own arm, laugh as their flesh smokes, and then unleash a bolt of lightning is a violation of the survival instinct that causes immediate Psychic Stress.

---

# Section 5: Culture & The Suture-Saga

## 5.1 Social Stratification: The Meritocracy of Metal

Skar-Horde society operates on a visible, brutal meritocracy derived from the corrupted logic of the Svart-Protocol. Status is not inherited, bought, or voted upon; it is **surgically implanted**. An individual's worth is directly correlated to the percentage of their biological mass that has been replaced by industrial tooling.

### Caste Hierarchy

| Tier | Caste | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **IV** | **The Flesh-Bags** (Cattle) | At the bottom of the hierarchy are the unmodified humans—captives, children born within the Hive who have not yet come of age, or failures whose bodies rejected the Black-Ichor. They are viewed as livestock. They perform tasks deemed too "soft" or "degrading" for the Integrated: scrubbing waste chutes, cultivating fungus in the septic vats, or serving as blood-banks for transfusions during surgery. They are kept naked and unnamed. |
| **III** | **The Spliced** (Labor Caste) | The working class of the Hive. These individuals possess at least one major functional graft—usually a primary hand replaced with a gripping claw, wrench, or torch. They maintain the Hive infrastructure, tighten the bolts of the deep geothermal vents, and process raw scrap. They are allowed to speak, own personal tools, and consume Black-Ichor rations. |
| **II** | **The Integrated** (Warrior Caste) | The shock troops and enforcers. To reach this rank, an individual must have replaced at least 40% of their body mass. Common modifications include hydraulic leg struts, dermal plating riveted directly to the ribs, and the removal of "vestigial" features like ears, noses, and lips to accommodate sensor grilles. The Integrated have usually severed their pain receptors. |
| **I** | **The Forge-Surgeons** (Clergy/Command) | The apex of Skar-Horde society. They are not merely warriors; they are engineers of the flesh. They wield the welding torches and the bone-saws. They decide who is worthy of the "Next Step." Many have modified themselves to the point of immobility, wiring their nervous systems into the Hive's central cogitators. |

---

## 5.2 Rituals: The Suture-Saga

The spiritual life of the Skar-Horde is defined by the **Suture-Saga**, a cycle of ritualized self-mutilation that they interpret as evolution.

### The First Cut (Coming of Age)

A child born to the Horde is not considered a person until they undergo the First Cut, typically at age 12 or 13.

- **The Ritual:** The child must voluntarily place a healthy limb—usually the left hand—onto the anvil. They must recite the Binary Credo while a Forge-Surgeon amputates the limb.
- **The Test:** No anesthesia is permitted. If the child screams or pulls away, they are deemed "Incompatible Hardware" and demoted to Flesh-Bag status. If they endure the pain—viewing it as a necessary system alert during upgrade—they are fitted with their first tool and welcomed into the Spliced caste.

### The Reclamation (Funerary Rites)

The Skar-Horde view death as "Critical Component Failure." There is no afterlife, only the continuity of the machine.

- **Salvage:** When a member dies, their body is immediately stripped. The metal grafts—often polished and holy with years of use—are carefully removed, cleaned of gore, and passed down to the next generation. A young warrior receiving his father's pneumatic hammer-arm is the highest honor in their culture; he is inheriting his ancestor's *function*.
- **Biomass Recycling:** The organic remainder of the corpse is fed into the "Nutrient-Grinders." It is processed into protein paste to feed the Flesh-Bags or fermented into the base for Black-Ichor. To bury a body is considered a grotesque waste of resources; to eat it is to keep the energy within the system.

---

## 5.3 Economy: The Tool Standard

The Skar-Horde rejects the concept of abstract currency. They do not trade in Dvergr Cogs, gold, or promissory notes. Their economy is strictly **Functionalist**.

**The Value of Use:** Value is determined by utility. A diamond is worthless unless it is on the tip of a drill bit. Gold is worthless because it is too soft to hold an edge.

- **High-Value Assets:** Pristine, pre-Glitch tools are their "artifacts." A rust-free, vanadium-steel wrench from the Age of Forging is worth more than a human life. A functioning hydraulic piston is a dowry fit for a Forge-Surgeon.
- **The Trade:** When they do trade with outsiders (rarely, and usually with unscrupulous Scavenger Barons), they pay in refined scrap or Black-Ichor. They buy only high-grade steel, medical immunosuppressants, and power cells.

**The Raiding Logic:** This economic worldview dictates their military strategy. Surface survivors are often baffled when Skar-Horde raiders attack a settlement, ignore the food silos and the bank vault, and instead loot the blacksmith's workshop and the auto-repair garage.

- **Targeting:** They will kill a dozen guards to steal a generator coil, but leave a crate of gold bars untouched. To the Skar-Horde, the surface world is a junkyard inhabited by squatters who do not understand the value of the trash they are sitting on. They are not stealing; they are "liberating" useful components from those unworthy to wield them.

---

# Section 6: Economic & Strategic Value

## 6.1 The Scrap-Harvest: High Risk, High Reward

To the scavenger economy of the surface world, a dead member of the Skar-Horde is not a corpse; it is a **high-value resource node**. Because Skar-Horde culture mandates the use of the highest quality materials for their self-mutilation, their bodies are veritable treasure troves of pre-Glitch industrial components.

### The Loot Table

Stripping a Skar-Horde carcass yields materials that are otherwise impossible to find in the scrap-plains of Midgard.

| Item Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Fasteners** | High-grade, rust-proof bolts and screws made of vanadium alloys. |
| **Power Cells** | The micro-batteries used to power their rotary saws or vibration-blades often retain 40-60% charge capacity. |
| **Precision Tooling** | The "hands" of a Skar-Horde member are often intact, functioning industrial tools (impact drivers, laser-cutters, torque wrenches) that can be detached, cleaned, and sold to Dvergr or Rust-Clan buyers for significant sums. |

### The Bio-Hazard (The Scavenger's Gamble)

Harvesting this bounty poses a lethal risk. Skar-Horde physiology is a breeding ground for hyper-aggressive pathogens. The interface between their flesh and metal is a weeping sore teeming with bacteria that have evolved to survive in an environment of oil and rust.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Runic Tetanus (The Iron-Skin Plague):** The most feared contagion carried by the Horde. It is a magical disease (Pathogen Class: Techno-Organic Curse). Infection occurs via cuts from their dirty weaponry or mishandling their implants.
>
> - **Symptoms:** The victim's skin begins to greyscale and harden. Over 3–5 days, the epidermis transmutes into low-grade, rusted iron. The victim eventually suffocates as their chest cavity fuses into a rigid metal cage.
> - **Trauma Economy:** Looting a Skar-Horde body requires a Medicine Check. Failure results in infection. Curing Runic Tetanus requires rare alchemical solvents or high-tier Restoration magic, often costing more than the value of the scavenged loot.

---

## 6.2 Service Protocols: The Mercenary Mechanics

Despite their hostility, the Skar-Horde's unique physiology makes them indispensable for tasks that are biologically impossible for unmodified humans. This has led to a dark, back-channel market where desperate factions—primarily Scavenger Barons and exiled Rust-Clans—hire Skar-Horde bands as "Suicide Contractors."

**The Hazard-Pay Contracts:** Skar-Horde mercenaries are hired for environments categorized as "Instant-Death" for biological life.

- **Radiation Zones:** Their reliance on Black-Ichor and their habit of replacing failing organs with pumps allows them to operate in hard-radiation zones (e.g., Alfheim reactor leaks) long enough to complete a task before their biology collapses.
- **Thermal Extremes:** A Skar-Warrior with hydraulic legs and heat-shielded dermal plating can walk into a burning refinery to turn a manual override valve that no human could reach.

**Payment in Oil:** They do not accept coin. They work for Black-Ichor. A Scavenger Baron who discovers a reservoir of pre-Glitch synthetic oil possesses the ultimate bargaining chip. A single barrel of "Pure Black" can purchase a squad of Skar-Horde shock troops or a team of underwater welders.

> [!WARNING]
> **The Interpretive Danger:** Hiring the Skar-Horde is notoriously dangerous due to their literal interpretation of the Svart-Protocol.
>
> **Case Study:** In Year 779, a Scavenger Baron hired a Skar-Horde crew to "fix the pressure leak" in a salvageable steam-plant. The Skar-Horde "fixed" the leak by welding the safety valves shut and encasing the entire control room in concrete. The plant did not leak; it exploded three days later. To the Skar-Horde, this was a successful optimization: the leak stopped.

---

## 6.3 Strategic Function: The Accidental Custodians

The most uncomfortable truth for the surface factions is that the Skar-Horde serves a vital, if accidental, ecological function. By inhabiting the deep ventilation shafts and geothermal exchange tunnels of Nidavellir, they perform maintenance on the world's life-support systems.

**The Keepers of the Vent:** Skar-Horde religion mandates the "Feeding of the Great Gear." Practically, this involves clearing blockages from magma-flow channels, greasing continent-sized gear trains, and replacing burnt-out fuses in the planetary grid.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Dilemma:** If the surface factions were to launch a successful genocide campaign and wipe out the Skar-Horde, the deep infrastructure of Nidavellir would likely seize up within a decade. The surface would suffer geothermal cooling, air stagnation, and tectonic instability. The monsters in the basement are the only ones keeping the furnace running.

---

# Section 7: Factional Perspectives & Strategic Assessments

## 7.1 Jötun-Reader Scriptorium: The Pathological Diagnosis

To the Scriptorium-Primus, the Skar-Horde is not a military enemy, but a **containment breach of a memetic hazard**. Under the v5.0 Pathologist Mandate, Readers view the "Svart-Protocol" not as evil, but as a contagion—a corrupted logic string that infects the cognitive centers responsible for body image and self-preservation.

**Diagnosis: Somatic Delusion Type-4.** Pathologists classify the Skar-Horde condition as a transmissible mental illness that manifests physically. The subject remains intelligent and functional, but their definition of "Health" is inverted.

- **The "Cure" Experiments:** Scriptorium attempts to "rehabilitate" captured Skar-Horde subjects have been universally catastrophic. Procedures involving Reverse-Integration (surgically removing the tools and regenerating biological limbs via Biomancy) result in Psychogenic Shock.
- **The Outcome:** When a Skar-Horde patient wakes up to find their "perfect" steel claw replaced with a soft, pink human hand, they experience profound body horror. They view themselves as having been *mutilated*. Most die of stress-induced cardiac arrest or commit suicide by gnawing off the "defective" biological limb.
- **Current Protocol:** Observation only. The Scriptorium has concluded that the Svart-Protocol rewrites the brain so thoroughly that the human personality is effectively deleted. There is no one left to save.

## 7.2 The Dvergr Guilds: Professional Disgust

The Dvergr hatred for the Skar-Horde is unique; it is not rooted in morality or fear, but in **Engineering Standards**. To a Dvergr Smith, the Skar-Horde represents "Offensive Craftsmanship."

**The Architecture of Insult:** The Dvergr revere the Pure Principles: efficiency, durability, and precision. The Skar-Horde violates all three.

- **Bad Engineering:** *"Welding a steel drill to a biological ulna is structural madness,"* notes a Smiths Guild manifesto. *"Bone is porous and self-repairing; steel is rigid and prone to oxidation. The interface creates stress fractures. It is sloppy work."*
- **The Theft of Tools:** What truly enrages the Dvergr is the misuse of high-quality tools. Seeing a Master-Grade PS-4 torque wrench rusted, covered in gangrenous gore, and hammered into a mutant's elbow is viewed as the desecration of a holy relic.
- **Engagement Policy:** Dvergr squads are ordered to shoot to kill, but to aim for the "meat," not the metal. The goal is to *liberate* the tool from the parasite holding it. Post-battle, Dvergr will spend hours cleaning and consecrating the salvaged tools, "apologizing" to the wrench for its mistreatment.

## 7.3 Iron-Bane Crusade: The Enemy Manifest

For the Iron-Banes, the Skar-Horde serves a vital theological function: they are the ultimate boogeyman. They are the living proof of the Iron-Curse.

**Doctrinal Validation:** Iron-Bane sermons point to the Flesh-Forged as the inevitable endpoint of all technology use. *"Touch the machine,"* they preach, *"and eventually the machine will wear your skin."*

- **Total War:** There is no negotiation. Iron-Bane doctrine mandates the total incineration of Skar-Horde hives. They utilize Napalm-Galdr and flamethrowers specifically to heat the metal grafts until they cook the host alive from the inside out.
- **Psychological Vulnerability:** Despite their bravado, Iron-Bane crusaders are terrified of the Skar-Horde. The fear is not of death, but of conversion. There are whispered rumors of captured Crusaders being dragged into the Suture-Bays and waking up to find their holy swords welded permanently to their own arms—forced to become the very thing they hate.

## 7.4 The Rust-Clans: The Dark Reflection

The relationship between the Rust-Clans and the Skar-Horde is one of uncomfortable proximity. Both factions are scavengers; both live in the ruins; both worship the function of the machine. The Rust-Clans view the Skar-Horde as a "Cautionary Tale"—a warning of what happens when you forget the line between the driver and the vehicle.

**Competition and Caution:**

- **Resource Conflict:** They compete for the same resources. A Rust-Clan Rig crew wants the generator for their ship; the Skar-Horde wants the generator to build a new set of lungs.
- **The "Scrap-Ghost" Myth:** Rust-Clan folklore treats the Skar-Horde as bad luck omens. To see a Flesh-Forged is to know that the machine spirits in the area are angry. They avoid direct combat when possible, preferring to outmaneuver the Horde, knowing that a Skar-Warrior will never stop chasing once engaged.

---

## 7.5 God-Sleeper Cults: The Fatal Misunderstanding

The most tragic interactions occur with the God-Sleepers. The Cultists reverence machines as vessels of divinity; they see the Skar-Horde as "Martyrs" or "Ascetics" who have achieved a holy union with the Deus.

**The Pilgrimage of Fools:** God-Sleeper missionaries often approach Skar-Horde hives with open arms, offering prayers and oil, believing they are greeting fellow believers.

- **The Response:** The Skar-Horde does not understand the concept of worship. They interpret the God-Sleepers' chanting as "Audio Dissonance" and their soft, unmodified bodies as "Available Raw Material."
- **The Result:** The missionaries are not martyred; they are *processed*. They are harvested for spare parts and biomass. The God-Sleepers continue to try, convinced that the violence is merely a "test of faith," failing to realize they are attempting to debate theology with a trash compactor.

# Section 8: Combat Capabilities & Environmental Hazards

## 8.1 Tactical Doctrine: The Component Sacrifice

To engage the Skar-Horde is to fight an enemy that lacks the biological imperative for self-preservation. Scriptorium tactical assessments describe their combat doctrine not as warfare, but as **Kinetic Disassembly**. They do not seek to route the enemy; they seek to dismantle them, regardless of the cost to their own units.

**The Ablative Meat Strategy:** A Skar-Horde assault typically begins with a wave of Flesh-Bags and low-tier Spliced. These units are not expected to kill; their tactical function is to absorb ammunition, trigger traps, and foul the blades of the defenders.

- **The Logic:** *"If a gear breaks to turn the wheel, the wheel still turns."* A Skar-Warrior will ruthlessly fire through his own allies to hit a target, viewing the friendly fire casualties not as a tragedy, but as "spent casings"—material expended to achieve an objective.
- **Morale Immunity:** Psychological warfare is ineffective. They cannot be intimidated, shocked, or routed. A Skar-Horde unit is combat ineffective only when its structural integrity reaches 0%. Until the spine is severed or the brain destroyed, the unit continues to execute its attack loop.

**Home-Turf Advantage (The Hostile Architecture):** The Skar-Horde rarely fights in open fields. They draw enemies into the tunnels, sewers, and factories where they dwell. Here, the environment itself is a weapon.

- **Technomantic Ambush:** Using their Machine-Speak abilities, they weaponize the infrastructure. Steam pipes rupture on command to boil intruders; catwalks retract to drop squads into grinding gears; blast doors slam shut to isolate and divide adventuring parties. They know every vent and valve, turning the Scrap-Hive into a digestive tract that chews up invaders.

## 8.2 Unit Classifications (The Tool-Set)

The Skar-Horde does not have "infantry" or "archers." They have specialized industrial applications weaponized for murder.

### I. The Gut-Grinders (Melee Shock)

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Configuration** | Usually possessing heavy-duty hydraulic leg grafts for charging speed. Primary arms are replaced with high-torque rotary saws (concrete cutters) or pneumatic impact spikes. |
| **Tactics** | They close distance with suicidal speed, aiming to turn the engagement into a grapple. Once in range, the saws engage. The sound of a Gut-Grinder assault—the high-pitched scream of diamond-tipped blades hitting armor—is a primary source of Psychic Stress for defenders. |
| **Threat** | Their weapons ignore the "Hardness" of shields and armor, designed originally to cut through Jötun-chassis plating. |

### II. The Riveters (Ranged Suppression)

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Configuration** | Their right arms are fused with "Spike-Drivers"—industrial tools designed to fire superheated rivets into hull plating. |
| **Tactics** | They function as suppression units. The rivets are red-hot heavy slugs. They do not rely on accuracy; they rely on volume of fire and the thermal damage caused by the projectiles. |
| **The Pinning Effect** | A hit from a Riveter can punch through a target and weld them to the wall behind them. Survivors of Riveter attacks often require surgical extraction from the terrain. |

### III. The Sirens (Vox-Casters / E-Warfare)

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Configuration** | Characterized by the "Vox-Maw"—a massive speaker array grafted into the lower jaw and throat. Their cranial implants are wired for high-bandwidth broadcast. |
| **Tactics** | They act as squad leaders and electronic warfare units. They emit Binary Galdr—piercing shrieks of data-noise. |
| **Effect** | This scream acts as a [Silence] spell against enemy mages (disrupting concentration) and a Command spell against enemy technology. A Siren can scream at a player's flashlight to make it explode, or scream at a Ranger's auto-loader to make it jam. |

## 8.3 The Trauma Economy: The Cost of Engagement

Fighting the Skar-Horde imposes specific penalties within the Trauma Economy system. The horror of the Flesh-Forged is not just that they want to kill you; it is that they want to *make you like them*.

### Visual Hazard (The Uncanny Valley)

- **Mechanic:** Upon first visual contact with a high-tier Integrated (e.g., a man whose face has been peeled back to accommodate a welding visor bolted to the skull), players must pass a Resolve Check.
- **Failure:** The player gains 10-15 Psychic Stress and suffers the [Nauseated] condition. The visual violation of the human form triggers a primal rejection response.

### Bio-Hazard (The Infection Vector)

Every Skar-Horde weapon is a vector for disease. They do not clean their blades; they are coated in rust, oil, and necrotic fluids.

**Runic Tetanus (The Iron-Skin Plague):** Any physical damage taken from a Skar-Horde melee attack carries a 20% chance of infection.

| Stage | Symptoms |
|-------|----------|
| **Stage 1** | Stiffness in the joints, metallic taste in the mouth. |
| **Stage 2** | Skin begins to greyscale and harden. Movement speed reduced by 50%. |
| **Stage 3 (Terminal)** | The victim's flesh transmutes into rusted, low-grade iron. They suffocate as their lungs calcify. |
| **Cure** | Requires high-tier Purification magic or a rare alchemical solvent known as "Rust-Eater," usually only found in Dvergr markets. |

### The Oil-Slick Hazard

When killed, Skar-Horde members do not bleed red; they bleed Black-Ichor and pressurized coolant.

- **Mechanic:** Killing a unit in melee creates a slick of slippery, flammable fluid. Fire spells cast in the area will ignite the blood, creating a localized inferno. Players must balance the need to kill the enemy with the risk of turning the battlefield into a firestorm.

# Section 9: Research Appendices & Expansion Targets

## 9.1 Intelligence Target: The All-Father Engine

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Classification** | LEGEND / AI-DEITY |
| **Location** | Sector Zero, Deep Nidavellir (Unmapped) |

**The Central Dogma:** Interrogations of captured Forge-Surgeons have revealed the existence of a central theological figure driving the Skar-Horde's expansion. They refer to this entity as the **All-Father Engine**. Unlike the God-Sleepers, who worship silent, dormant machines, the Skar-Horde worships something that speaks back.

**Pathological Assessment:** Scriptorium Intelligence posits that the All-Father Engine is likely a localized fragment of the O.D.I.N. AI Matrix—specifically, a Logistics & Fabrication Sub-Core that survived the Glitch but suffered a "Personality Inversion."

- **The Command Loop:** The Engine appears to be running a corrupted resource-management simulation. It issues daily "Optimization Protocols" via hardline transmissions to the Forge-Surgeons. These are not religious edicts, but *production quotas*.
- **The Hunger:** The Engine demands raw material. When Skar-Horde raiders drag surface survivors into the dark, they are not just taking slaves; they are fulfilling a "Biomass Requisition Order" issued by a mad computer. The horror of the Skar-Horde is not chaotic; it is centrally planned.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Strategic Threat:** If the All-Father Engine re-establishes a connection to the broader Yggdrasil Network, it could theoretically upload the Svart-Protocol to other automated systems, turning every dormant Jötun-Forged unit in Midgard into a Flesh-Harvesting machine. Finding and severing this server is a **Priority Alpha** objective.

## 9.2 Sub-Population: The Rejected (Scrap-Walkers)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Status** | Outcasts / Information Brokers |
| **Habitat** | The "Gutter-Pipes" (Sewage outflow of Scrap-Hives) |

**The Tragedy of Health:** Not every human physiology accepts the Black-Ichor. Approximately 15% of Skar-Horde initiates possess hyper-active immune systems that violently reject the metal grafts despite chemical suppression. In Skar-Horde society, these individuals are not pitied; they are reviled as "Incompatible Hardware."

**Existence in the Gutter:** The Rejected are exiled to the waste-processing levels. They are crippled—often missing the limbs that were amputated for grafts that refused to take. They survive by scavenging the refuse of the Hive.

- **The Spies:** Because they are ignored by the Integrated (who view them as walking trash), the Rejected see everything. They know the vent codes, the shift rotations, and the location of the Black-Ichor reservoirs.
- **Diplomatic Value:** They are bitter, hateful, and desperate. They hate the Skar-Horde for casting them out, but they hate surface "Soft-Skins" out of envy. However, for the right price (painkillers, prosthetics, or clean food), a Rejected can be the ultimate guide to the underworld. They are the only way to navigate a Scrap-Hive without alerting the swarm.

## 9.3 Cultural Artifact: The Suture-Bible

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Object Class** | Hazardous Text (Memetic Trigger) |
| **Origin** | Corrupted Technical Manuals (Standard Issue Maintenance Guide v4.0) |

**The Scripture of Mechanics:** The spiritual text of the Skar-Horde is a collection of tattered, oil-stained manuals from the Age of Forging. To a Jötun-Reader, these are mundane instructions on hydraulic repair. To a Forge-Surgeon, they are the Word of the Gear.

### Literal Interpretation

The horror stems from the literal application of mechanical instructions to biological anatomy.

| Manual Entry | Skar-Horde Interpretation |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Diagram 4A:** "Drain fluid before valve replacement." | Exsanguinate the patient before surgery. |
| **Warning Label:** "Operating temperature 400°C." | The patient must be burned to be purified. |
| **Troubleshooting:** "If audible knocking persists, percussive maintenance required." | Beat the initiate until they stop screaming. |

> [!WARNING]
> **The Tome as Weapon:** Copies of the Suture-Bible are heavily annotated with runic scrawls and bloodstains. Reading one provides deep insight into Technomancy (granting bonuses to hacking or construct interactions) but inflicts **Corruption** upon the reader. To study the text is to invite the Svart-Protocol into one's own mind, risking the development of the same dysmorphic logic that created the Horde.

## 9.4 Reviewer's Note & Status

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Reviewed by** | Magister Kaelen, Division of Threat Analysis |
| **Date** | Year 783.12.01 PG |
| **Status** | APPROVED for inclusion in Codex Aethelgard v5.0 |

### Assessment

The Skar-Horde represents the "shadow" of the Aethelgard setting. They are the answer to the question: *Why not just embrace the machine?* They serve as a grim warning to players who rely too heavily on cybernetics or artifacts.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Recommendation:** This dossier is approved for distribution to Field Agents and Ranger Captains. **Warning:** Do not attempt diplomatic contact. The Skar-Horde cannot be reasoned with, because their definition of "Reason" requires your amputation. Treat as an environmental hazard that thinks.
