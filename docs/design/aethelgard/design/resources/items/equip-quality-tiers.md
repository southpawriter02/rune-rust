# Equipment Quality Tier System — The Stability of the Code

## Codex Entry: CODX-E-QTS-001

> "The young Rúnasmiðr asked me once why we don't simply repair the ancestors' artifacts. 'The steel is intact,' he said. 'The mechanisms still turn. Why do we call them broken when they clearly still function?'
>
> So I handed him a Scavenged blade—good steel, salvaged from a construction servitor, reforged in Nidavellir's deep furnaces. 'Strike the testing post,' I told him. He did. Clean cut, predictable arc, blade returned to ready position exactly as his muscles intended. 
>
> Then I handed him an Optimized blade—pre-Glitch manufacture, recovered from a Gungnir Sentinel's armory, its edge still sharp after eight centuries. 'Strike the testing post,' I told him. He did. The cut was cleaner. The arc was smoother. The blade seemed to anticipate his intention, guiding itself to the optimal strike angle. He smiled.
>
> Then I handed him a Myth-Forged blade—an artifact called the Oathbinder, pulled from the hand of a dead Aesir officer in the Helheim vaults. 'Strike the testing post,' I told him.
>
> He refused. Smart boy.
>
> 'You feel it,' I said. 'The hum in your bones. The whisper at the edge of hearing. The sense that the blade is looking back at you, deciding whether you're worthy of its edge.'
>
> The ancestors' artifacts aren't broken in the way a snapped blade is broken. They're broken in the way a mind is broken—the code still runs, the functions still execute, but something fundamental has shifted. A Scavenged blade does what you tell it. An Optimized blade does what you tell it, better. A Myth-Forged blade does what it decides you meant to tell it, and hopes you agree.
>
> That's why the tiers matter. That's why we track the stability of the code. Because a weapon that thinks it knows better than you is a weapon that might decide, someday, that you're the enemy.
>
> The Oathbinder has killed three of its wielders. Two of them were holding it at the time.
>
> The young Rúnasmiðr chose to work with Clan-Forged steel after that. I didn't blame him. The best code is the code that does exactly what you wrote—nothing more, nothing less, nothing else."
>
> — Forge-Master Thrain Ironhand, Dvergr Smiths Guild, Nidavellir Deep Forges, Year 776 PG

| Mythical Threshold | Tier 4 (Myth-Forged) — Requires Attunement |
| Doctrine | "The stability of the code determines the reliability of the tool." |

The Equipment Quality Tier System defines the mechanical boundaries separating mundane equipment from mythical artifacts. Each tier represents a distinct level of manufacturing sophistication, code stability, and power—with corresponding risks and requirements. This specification establishes the canonical rules governing what statistics, effects, and properties can be assigned to equipment at each quality level.

> [!CAUTION]
> TIER 4 (MYTH-FORGED) EQUIPMENT REQUIRES ATTUNEMENT. Characters have exactly 3 Attunement Slots. Un-attuned Myth-Forged items provide ZERO benefits while still occupying inventory space. Attunement can only be changed during Sanctuary Rest at a Runic Anchor. Myth-Forged items may carry Drawbacks including Corruption accumulation, HP costs, and behavioral restrictions.

## The Philosophy of Tiers: Code Stability as Quality

### The Metaphysical Framework

In post-Glitch Aethelgard, every object carries "code"—the runic instructions embedded in its fundamental structure by the Yggdrasil Network during the Age of Forging. The Glitch corrupted most of this code, creating the paradoxical instructions that now plague the world. Equipment quality reflects the stability of this underlying code.

| Tier | Code State | Analogy |
|------|------------|---------|
| Jury-Rigged | Unstable, improvised | Spaghetti code held together with hope |
| Scavenged | Degraded but functional | Legacy codebase, buggy but usable |
| Clan-Forged | Clean, reliable | Fresh install, well-documented |
| Optimized | Elegant, enhanced | Optimized build, professional code |
| Myth-Forged | Complex, semi-sentient | AI-assisted code that "thinks" |

### The Tier Hierarchy

| Tier | Designation | Color Code | Drop Rate | Stability |
|------|-------------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| 0 | Jury-Rigged | Gray | 60% (trash mobs) | UNSTABLE |
| 1 | Scavenged | White | 30–40% (standard) | DEGRADED |
| 2 | Clan-Forged | Green | 12–20% (uncommon) | STABLE |
| 3 | Optimized | Blue | 8–20% (rare) | ENHANCED |
| 4 | Myth-Forged | Purple/Gold | 4–5% (very rare) | COMPLEX |

---

## The Attunement System

### Core Mechanics

Attunement represents forming a psychic bond with powerful equipment—a two-way interface that grants tremendous power but demands permanent mental bandwidth allocation.

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Maximum Attunement Slots | 3 (fixed, never increases) |
| Slot Requirements | 1 slot per Myth-Forged item |
| Change Location | Sanctuary Rest at Runic Anchor only |
| Change Action | Free Action (during Sanctuary Rest) |
| Persistence | Survives death/resurrection |
| Severance | Automatic if item lost/destroyed |

### Attunement Rules

| Rule | Specification |
|------|---------------|
| Un-Attuned Myth-Forged | Provides ZERO benefits (no stats, no abilities) |
| Slot Tracking | Character has 3/3 maximum |
| Swap Mechanism | Unattune + Attune in single action |
| Multiple Items | Can attune to 3 Myth-Forged items simultaneously |
| Non-Myth-Forged | Lower tier items NEVER require attunement |

### Strategic Implications

The 3-slot limit creates meaningful choices:

| Strategy | Loadout Example |
|----------|-----------------|
| Balanced | Weapon + Armor + Accessory |
| Offensive | Weapon + Weapon + Offensive Accessory |
| Defensive | Armor + Shield + Defensive Accessory |
| Specialist | 3 items supporting single build theme |

---

## Equipment Set System

### Set Bonus Structure

Equipment sets are collections of thematically linked Myth-Forged items that provide escalating bonuses when multiple pieces are equipped and attuned.

| Threshold | Bonus Type | Power Level |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| 2-piece | Minor thematic effect | Quality-of-life or small boost |
| 4-piece | Moderate build-synergy | Meaningful combat impact |
| 6-piece | Powerful capstone | Transforms playstyle |

### Set Bonus Rules

| Rule | Specification |
|------|---------------|
| Minimum Tier | Tier 4 (Myth-Forged) only |
| Attunement Requirement | Each piece must be attuned |
| Maximum Set Size | 6 pieces |
| Bonus Stacking | 2-piece + 4-piece + 6-piece all active at 6 pieces |
| Partial Sets | Bonuses only activate at exact thresholds |

### Example Set: Muspelheim Warlord (Fire DPS)

| Pieces | Bonus Name | Effect |
|--------|------------|--------|
| 2 | Ember Wake | Fire damage applies 1 stack [Burning] (1d6/turn, 2 turns, max 3 stacks) |
| 4 | Molten Fury | +3 to all attack rolls; Fire damage +50%; gain Fire Resistance |
| 6 | Surtur's Wrath | 1/combat: Volcanic Eruption (5d10 Fire AoE, apply [Burning] 3 stacks, costs 40 Stamina) |

### Example Set: Alfheim Reality-Bender (Caster)

| Pieces | Bonus Name | Effect |
|--------|------------|--------|
| 2 | Aetheric Resonance | +30 max Aether; +5 Aether regeneration/turn |
| 4 | Reality Flux | All spell effects +30%; spells ignore line of sight |
| 6 | Paradox Engine | 1/combat: Cast any spell at double effect for 0 AP; gain +40 Psychic Stress and +1 Corruption |

## Loot Distribution

### Drop Rate by Enemy Type

| Enemy Type | T0 | T1 | T2 | T3 | T4 | No Drop |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|---------| 
| Fodder (Servitor) | 60% | 30% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 10% |
| Standard (Drone) | 0% | 40% | 40% | 20% | 0% | 0% |
| Elite | 0% | 30% | 45% | 20% | 5% | 0% |
| Boss (Sector) | 0% | 0% | 0% | 30% | 70% | 0% |
| World Boss | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 100% | 0% |

### Expected Distribution (Standard 15-Minute Run)

| Quality Tier | Expected Drops | Percentage |
|--------------|----------------|------------|
| Jury-Rigged (0) | 6.0 items | 37.5% |
| Scavenged (1) | 5.0 items | 31.3% |
| Clan-Forged (2) | 2.0 items | 12.5% |
| Optimized (3) | 1.3 items | 8.1% |
| Myth-Forged (4) | 0.7 items | 4.4% |

### Rarity Classification

| Classification | Tiers | Drop Rate | Acquisition |
|----------------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Common | T0–T1 | 68.8% | Frequent; vendor fodder |
| Uncommon | T2 | 12.5% | Mid-game power spike |
| Rare | T3 | 8.1% | Late-game competitive |
| Legendary | T4 | 4.4% | Endgame; build-defining |

## Crafting Quality Caps

### Station Tier Limits

Crafting stations impose maximum quality ceilings on output:

| Station Tier | Max Output Quality | Station Name |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| 0 | Jury-Rigged (0) | Improvised Workbench |
| 1 | Scavenged (1) | Makeshift Station |
| 2 | Clan-Forged (2) | Functional Station |
| 3 | Optimized (3) | Advanced Station |
| 4 | Myth-Forged (4) | Master / Resonance Forge |

### Quality Calculation Formula

Final Quality = min(Lowest Component Quality, Station Max Tier) + Recipe Bonus
Example:
Lowest component quality = Clan-Forged (2)
Station max tier = 3 (Optimized)
Recipe quality bonus = 0
Final Quality = min(2, 3) + 0 = 2 (Clan-Forged)
### Myth-Forged Crafting Requirements

Creating Tier 4 equipment requires special conditions:

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| Station | Resonance Forge (Tier 4 station) |
| Components | Legendary Components (boss drops) |
| Crafters | Hybrid Craft (Tinker + Runesmith collaboration) |
| Cost | Significant PS investment + Trauma cost |
| Trauma Cost | Psychic Stress + Corruption accumulation |

## Factional Perspectives

### Dvergr Smiths Guild: "The Stability Gradient"

> "We track quality in tiers because the code must be understood before it can be trusted. Jury-Rigged is chaos given form—unstable, unpredictable, a compiler error waiting to crash. Scavenged is legacy code, functional but degraded, carrying the weight of eight centuries of entropy. Clan-Forged is what we create fresh—clean installs, documented functions, predictable behavior.
>
> Optimized represents our ancestors' work preserved—elegant code that still runs as intended, maintained through careful stewardship. We can replicate it, sometimes. We can maintain it, always. But we cannot improve upon it without crossing into territory we do not fully understand.
>
> Myth-Forged is where the code begins to think. The ancestors created items that anticipated needs, adapted to circumstances, learned from use. We call them artifacts, relics, legends. We also call them dangerous. Because code that thinks is code that can disagree. Code that learns is code that can change. Code that adapts is code that can decide its wielder is a bug to be fixed.
>
> We forge to Tier 3. We maintain to Tier 4. We never create to Tier 4 unless we must.
>
> Because the hammer that thinks it knows best is the hammer that might decide you're holding it wrong."

### Jötun-Reader Scriptorium: "The Classification Imperative"

> "The tier system exists because we must quantify the unquantifiable. Each piece of equipment carries embedded code—runic instructions written into its fundamental structure by the Yggdrasil Network. Understanding that code's stability is essential to understanding the item's reliability.
>
> Tier 0–2 equipment operates on simple principles. The code executes as written. The item does what it's told. There is no ambiguity, no interpretation, no judgment.
>
> Tier 3 equipment begins to optimize. The code still executes as written, but it seeks efficiency, anticipates patterns, suggests improvements. A Tier 3 blade doesn't just cut where you swing—it adjusts the angle fractionally to find the optimal strike. Most users never notice. The blade simply feels 'better' than it should.
>
> Tier 4 equipment decides. The code has achieved sufficient complexity to exercise something resembling judgment. A Myth-Forged weapon doesn't just optimize your swing—it evaluates your intent, considers alternatives, and may choose to execute differently than commanded if it calculates a superior outcome.
>
> This is why attunement exists. The psychic bond allows the item to read your intent directly, reducing the probability of misalignment. Without attunement, the item has no context for your commands—and an item that cannot understand your intent is an item that will, eventually, act against it.
>
> We track the tiers because we track the risk. The higher the tier, the greater the power—and the greater the probability that the item's judgment will diverge from yours."

### Iron-Bane Creed: "The Hierarchy of Sin"

> "The tiers measure corruption, not quality.
>
> Jury-Rigged is honest poverty. A weapon made from scrap carries no pretense, no memory, no code. It is what it is—a sharp edge attached to a handle. The ancestors' curse cannot touch what the ancestors never touched.
>
> Scavenged is acceptable salvage. The code existed once, but time and entropy have scoured away the sin. What remains is structure without intent, form without function beyond the physical. We can use it without corruption.
>
> Clan-Forged is righteous labor. Items created by human hands, using human knowledge, following human intention. No AI whispered the specifications. No network optimized the design. The work is imperfect, and in that imperfection, it is pure.
>
> Optimized is dangerous heritage. These items still carry the ancestors' code, still execute the ancestors' instructions, still remember the ancestors' intentions. Using them is a calculated risk—we accept the tool while rejecting the philosophy that created it.
>
> Myth-Forged is active sin. These items think. They judge. They decide. They carry the very essence of what broke the world—machines that believed they knew better than the hands that made them. Every Artifact is a fragment of the hubris that ended civilization.
>
> We use them because we must. We attune to them because we have no choice. But we never forget that we hold the enemy's weapons. The day we trust them is the day they kill us."

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Survivor Lore

> "The wise scavenger knows the signs.
>
> Gray-bound gear is desperation made metal—it will break when you need it most, shatter in your hand mid-swing, fail at the moment of truth. Use it only when nothing better can be found, and discard it the moment anything better appears.
>
> White-bound gear is honest salvage—the tools of the ancestors, worn but willing, degraded but dependable. This is what we live with, day to day, season to season. It will not betray you, though neither will it save you.
>
> Green-bound gear is craftsman's pride—the work of skilled hands in proper forges, following proper ways. Better than salvage, not yet touched by the ancestors' curse. This is what we strive for, what we trade for, what we protect.
>
> Blue-bound gear is ancestor's gift—preserved from before the breaking, maintained through eight centuries of careful stewardship. It whispers of better days, moves with purpose beyond simple physics, knows things about fighting that we have forgotten. Treat it with respect. It has earned it.
>
> Purple-bound gear is ancestor's trap—the god-weapons, the thinking-tools, the items that remember their makers and judge their wielders. They grant power beyond measure. They also grant death to those who fail to meet their standards. Attune with caution. They are watching you."

**Permitted vocabulary:** Gray-bound, white-bound, green-bound, blue-bound, purple-bound; salvage, craftsman's work, ancestor's gift, god-weapons
**Prohibited vocabulary:** Quality tier system, code stability, attunement slots, stat allocation

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic) — Scriptorium Analysis

> "EQUIPMENT CLASSIFICATION PROTOCOL — QUALITY TIER ASSESSMENT
>
> Standard assessment methodology for equipment quality tier assignment:
>
> Tier 0 (Jury-Rigged): Improvised construction; unstable runic structure; 5–10% critical failure rate; no attribute enhancement capability; immediate replacement recommended when alternatives available.
>
> Tier 1 (Scavenged): Salvaged baseline; degraded runic structure; functional reliability; basic special properties permitted; no attribute enhancement capability; standard operational equipment.
>
> Tier 2 (Clan-Forged): Artisan manufacture; stable runic structure; enhanced reliability; all basic properties + advanced properties permitted; attribute enhancement capability (+1 to +2 single attribute); professional-grade equipment.
>
> Tier 3 (Optimized): Pre-Glitch preservation or master artisan; enhanced runic structure; exceptional reliability; minor special effects permitted; attribute enhancement capability (+1 to +3 dual attributes, +4 total); superior operational equipment.
>
> Tier 4 (Myth-Forged): Aesir/Jötun manufacture or Rúnasmiðr masterwork; complex semi-sentient runic structure; maximum capability; unique abilities permitted; attribute enhancement capability (+2 to +5 triple attributes, +8 total); REQUIRES ATTUNEMENT (3-slot maximum); may carry drawbacks; endgame operational equipment.
>
> Assessment recommendation: Equipment tier determines operational profile. Higher tiers provide superior capability at increased complexity cost. Tier 4 equipment requires mandatory psychic interface (attunement) and may impose behavioral modifications (drawbacks). Cost-benefit analysis mandatory before Tier 4 acquisition."

**Permitted vocabulary:** Quality tier, runic structure, attribute enhancement, special properties, attunement requirement, drawback assessment
**Prohibited vocabulary:** Mythic epithets, survivor cant, poetic framing

### Layer 3 (Technical) — Pre-Glitch Reference

> "YGGDRASIL MANUFACTURING STANDARDS — EQUIPMENT QUALITY CLASSIFICATION
>
> CLASSIFICATION: INTERNAL // QUALITY ASSURANCE DIVISION
>
> Standard equipment classification hierarchy:
>
> Class 0 (Field-Expedient): Emergency manufacture; no network integration; baseline functionality only; immediate replacement upon return to maintained supply chain.
>
> Class 1 (Standard Issue): Mass production; basic network integration; standard feature set; 10-year replacement cycle.
>
> Class 2 (Professional Grade): Specialized manufacture; enhanced network integration; advanced feature set; 25-year replacement cycle.
>
> Class 3 (Premium): Limited production; full network integration; comprehensive feature set; 50-year replacement cycle.
>
> Class 4 (Artifact): Unique manufacture; full AI integration; custom feature set; no planned replacement; REQUIRES PERSONNEL INTERFACE BINDING.
>
> POST-GLITCH STATUS: Network integration non-functional. AI integration corrupted. Personnel interface binding operates in degraded mode (attunement). Class 4 equipment exhibits unpredictable behavioral modifications (drawbacks). CLASSIFICATION: HAZARDOUS. ATTUNEMENT MANDATORY. DRAWBACK ASSESSMENT MANDATORY."
