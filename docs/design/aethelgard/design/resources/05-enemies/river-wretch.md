# River-Wretch (Nix-Pattern Aquatic Custodian) — Sludge-Adapted Semi-Aquatic Predator Specification
## Codex Entry: CODX-B-RWR-001

> *"We found Kettil's body three days after he went to water the oxen. Or what was left of it. The River Wardens pulled him from the silt downstream of the old coolant plant—you could see the drag marks where something had hauled him from the bank into the deep water. His ankles were abraded raw, skin torn in strips where something had gripped him with fingers that wouldn't let go. But that wasn't what killed him, not really. The burns killed him. His legs from the knee down looked like they'd been dipped in lye—the flesh gone grey and sloughing, chemical blisters weeping fluid that smelled of ammonia and rust. The Wardens said he probably lived for hours in the water before he finally drowned. The Grey-Hand doesn't kill fast. It just holds you under and lets its skin do the rest. We'd been watering the herd at that bend for three generations. My grandfather watered there. My father watered there. But the water's changed since the ruins started leaking, and the things that live in it have changed too. The Wardens showed us the signs we missed—the grey slick on the eddies, the rainbow sheen in the culvert mouth, the tracks in the mud where something pale had dragged itself from bank to water and back again. They said the Grey-Hands were cleaners once, creatures that kept the rivers pure. Now they think we're the pollution. They think our breath and our blood and our warmth are contaminants that need to be removed. So they grab you by the ankles and they pull you under the silt and they hold you there with those cold, patient hands until you stop moving. Then they let you go, and the river carries you away, and the Grey-Hand goes back to waiting. My son asked why we can't just kill them all. I told him what the Wardens told me: there are more Grey-Hands every year because there's more poison every year. Kill one and two more crawl out of the culverts downstream. The only way to stop them is to stop the poison. And nobody knows how to do that anymore."*

The River-Wretch is not merely a predator—it is a **living contamination indicator** and a tragic demonstration of how the Runic Blight corrupts benevolent biological systems into lethal territorial hazards. Once gentle custodians that kept waterways clean, they now interpret all air-breathing life as pollution to be removed.

> [!CAUTION]
> **EXTREME AQUATIC HAZARD. CHEMICAL CONTACT TOXIN. DROWNING VECTOR.** The River-Wretch represents the catastrophic corruption of Vanir waterway maintenance bio-engineering: docile biological filters whose absorption pathways have been overwhelmed by post-Glitch industrial contamination. **Dermal exudate causes severe chemical burns and systemic toxemia on contact.** Primary detection indicators: grey slicks and chemical rainbow sheens in eddies; ammonia-metallic odor detectable at < 3 m; silt nests near culvert mouths; drag-tracks from bank to water showing webbed digit impressions; water turbidity spikes with silent boil before grab events. **Black-flag conditions triggering immediate withdrawal:** grey sheen visible on water surface; chemical rainbow in eddies; ammonia-metallic scent detected; any silent silt boil; drag-track patterns at bank. **Abort gates:** culvert mouth proximity (< 10 m); any limb contact with grey-flow water; detected turbidity spike. Survival rate with grey-flow avoidance protocol: 98.2%. Primary hazards: drowning via sustained submersion and silt entrapment; contact chemical burns (pH 3.5–4.2); systemic toxemia from dermal exudate absorption; secondary CPS agitation in contaminated fog conditions.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The River Custodian

### Original Design Purpose

The Nix-Pattern Aquatic Custodian was not designed for predation—it was engineered to be a **living water purification system**, a masterwork of Vanir bio-engineering created for waterway maintenance throughout the Midgard Deck.

| Design Parameter | Specification |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Designation** | Nix-Pattern Aquatic Custodian |
| **Division** | Vanir Bio-Assets Division (Waterway Maintenance Subdivision) |
| **Primary Function** | Biological filtration and neutralization of mild chemical pollutants |
| **Secondary Function** | Manual sluice gate operation and blockage clearance |
| **Tertiary Function** | Debris removal and waterway flow maintenance |
| **Deployment Era** | Age of Forging (Midgard Deck Waterway Operations) |
| **Original Network** | Integrated with Midgard Waterway Sanitation Grid |

### Biological Filtration Architecture

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Rubberized Dermis** | Engineered skin designed to absorb and sequester mild chemical pollutants |
| **Absorption Pathway** | Metabolic system converting absorbed toxins into inert compounds |
| **Humanoid Morphology** | Designed for operating submerged manual overrides on sluice gates |
| **Semi-Aquatic Adaptation** | Extended underwater operation capability; low metabolic profile |
| **Docility Programming** | Behavioral modification ensuring non-aggressive response to personnel |
| **Network Integration** | Health monitoring via Midgard Sanitation Grid; contamination threshold alerts |

### The Gentle Custodian (Original Function)

| Parameter | Pre-Glitch Specification |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Absorption Capacity** | Designed for mild pollutants; residential and light industrial waste |
| **Toxin Processing** | Metabolic neutralization into inert compounds; no bioaccumulation |
| **Behavioral Profile** | Docile, task-focused; ignored authorized personnel entirely |
| **Operational Range** | Short patrol reaches (2–5 km of waterway per specimen) |
| **Interaction Protocol** | Non-aggressive; would relocate if approached |
| **Purpose** | Silent, unseen janitors maintaining waterway clarity and flow |

> [!NOTE]
> **The Invisible Janitors.** Pre-Glitch Nix-Pattern Custodians were engineered specifically for autonomous waterway maintenance. They absorbed mild pollutants, cleared debris, operated manual sluice gates, and maintained the flow of the Midgard Deck's engineered river systems. They were no more dangerous than the filtration systems they supplemented—docile, task-focused, and entirely ignorant of human presence. The Glitch transformed them from gentle custodians into patient drowning machines, their absorption pathways overwhelmed and their purpose catastrophically inverted.

## The Glitch and the Souring Tides: Corruption Vector

### Network Severance Event

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not simply release the Nix-Pattern—it **drowned** them in poison.

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Ginnungagap Glitch** | Instantaneous severance of Midgard Waterway Sanitation Grid |
| **Industrial Collapse** | Jötunheim and Helheim waste-reclamation systems catastrophically failed |
| **The Souring Tides** | Unfiltered toxic waste flooded planetary water table |
| **Contamination Profile** | Heavy metals, corrosive coolants, raw Blighted Aether saturated waterways |
| **Absorption Overload** | Nix-Pattern filtration capacity overwhelmed by contamination volume |
| **Metabolic Failure** | Processing pathways failed; chronic toxin bioaccumulation began |
| **Result** | Mutagenic transformation; behavioral inversion; predatory emergence |

### The Corruption Cascade

| Stage | Process |
|-------|---------|
| **1. Network Severance** | Midgard Sanitation Grid connection lost; contamination alerts disabled |
| **2. Souring Tides** | Industrial waste flooded waterways; toxin concentration exceeded design parameters |
| **3. Absorption Overload** | Nix-Pattern attempted to process impossible contamination volume |
| **4. Metabolic Failure** | Processing pathways overwhelmed; toxins accumulated in tissues |
| **5. Blight Integration** | Runic Blight energy corrupted biological systems |
| **6. Mutagenic Transformation** | Physical and neurological changes; tissues became toxic |
| **7. Behavioral Inversion** | High-level cognition erased; "clean the flow" directive corrupted |
| **8. Predatory Emergence** | Air-breathers now classified as "contaminants" requiring removal |

### The Corrupted Biology

| Original System | Corrupted Function |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Pollutant Absorption** | Now bioaccumulates heavy metals and Blighted compounds in tissues |
| **Metabolic Processing** | Failed; tissues saturated with concentrated toxins |
| **Docility Response** | Replaced by territorial ambush behavior |
| **Task Focus** | Inverted; air-breathers classified as pollution to be removed |
| **Dermis Function** | Now exudes contact-irritant toxins rather than absorbing them |
| **Patrol Behavior** | Maintained but now serves predatory ambush function |

> *"The Nix-Pattern Aquatic Custodian was designed to absorb toxins and keep waterways clean. When the Glitch collapsed the waste-reclamation systems and flooded every river with industrial poison, the Nix kept absorbing—but now they were absorbing a thousand times more than they were built to handle. Their biology couldn't tell the difference between manageable pollutants and lethal contamination. Their filtration systems tried to process an ocean of poison, and when they failed, the poison became part of them. Their flesh turned pale and bloated with accumulated metals. Their skin began to weep the toxins they could no longer neutralize. And their simple programming—'remove contaminants from the water'—twisted into something horrifying. They still patrol their reaches. They still remove contaminants. But now they've decided that anything that breathes air and disturbs their grey-flowing rivers is a contaminant that needs to be cleaned away. They don't hate you. They don't even see you as prey. They see you as pollution. And their job is to remove pollution by dragging it under the silt until it stops moving."*

---

## Behavioral Patterns

### Territorial Ambush Profile

The River-Wretch's deadliest attribute is its **patience**—it waits, half-buried in silt, for hours or days until a "contaminant" presents itself.

| Trigger | Response | Warning Time |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Bank Approach (Grey-Flow)** | Submerged observation; grab preparation | 0–5 seconds |
| **Wading Silhouette** | Immediate grab attempt | 2–4 seconds |
| **Boat Gunwale Overhang** | Grab at overhanging limbs or equipment | 3–6 seconds |
| **Livestock Watering** | Ambush on animals approaching waterline | 2–5 seconds |
| **Culvert Transit** | Ambush from concealment | 1–3 seconds |

### The Grab-Drag Cycle

| Phase | Duration | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **1. Detection** | Variable | Specimen detects disturbance at water surface or bank |
| **2. Positioning** | 5–30 s | Silent movement to optimal grab position; silt disturbance minimal |
| **3. Pre-Grab** | 1–3 s | Water turbidity spike; silent silt boil (only warning) |
| **4. Grab Initiation** | < 1 s | Webbed hands seize ankles, calves, or gunwales |
| **5. Pull Phase** | 10–90 s | Sustained pull toward deep water/silt line; grip force 800–1,200 N |
| **6. Submersion** | Variable | Target pulled below silt curtain; held until motion ceases |
| **7. Release** | After stillness | Specimen releases once "contaminant" neutralized (drowned) |
| **8. Return** | 5–15 min | Specimen returns to ambush position |

### Directive Logic (Corrupted Programming)

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Patrol Pattern** | Maintains short reaches (0.8–4.5 km); systematic territory coverage |
| **Ambush Positioning** | Waits half-submerged in silt near banks, culverts, and intakes |
| **Target Classification** | Air-breathing organisms classified as "contaminants" in aquatic environment |
| **Response Objective** | Remove contaminants by dragging below silt line until motion ceases |
| **Post-Removal Behavior** | Returns to patrol; does not consume or further interact with victims |
| **Motivation** | Not predation or hunger—corrupted sanitation directive |

### Target Prioritization Matrix

| Priority | Target | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **1** | Wading humanoids | Direct water disturbance; maximum contamination profile |
| **2** | Watering livestock | Large disturbance; high biomass "contamination" |
| **3** | Boat passengers with overhanging limbs | Accessible targets near water surface |
| **4** | Bank-approach humanoids | Potential water contact imminent |
| **5** | Stationary bank observers | Lowest priority; monitored but not engaged unless approach |

---

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Aquatic Chemical-Contact Predator

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Threat** | EXTREME; grab-drag drowning with chemical burn complication |
| **Predictability** | HIGH; grey-flow zones mappable; behavior pattern consistent |
| **Environmental** | MODERATE; limited to contaminated waterway corridors |
| **Detection** | MODERATE; field signs (grey sheen, odor, tracks) identifiable |
| **Avoidance** | HIGH; grey-flow exclusion protocol highly effective |
| **Engagement** | NOT RECOMMENDED; dermal contact hazard complicates intervention |

### Engagement Profile

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Grab Force** | 800–1,200 N sustained pull |
| **Attack Method** | Ankle/calf grab + sustained drag toward deep water |
| **Attack Window** | 2–6 seconds from detection to grab |
| **Dermal Exudate pH** | 3.5–4.2 (highly acidic) |
| **Contact Burn Onset** | 30 seconds sustained contact |
| **Secondary Hazard** | Systemic toxemia from dermal absorption |
| **Pursuit Range** | Does not pursue onto dry land; releases if target reaches bank |
| **Disengagement Trigger** | Target exits water; target ceases motion (drowning complete) |

### Four-Stage Threat Assessment Ladder

| Stage | Designation | Indicators | Action |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **1** | Territory Awareness | Known grey-flow reach on planned route | Implement grey-flow avoidance; use watering troughs; no direct water access |
| **2** | Presence Detected | Grey sheen, ammonia-metallic odor, drag-tracks at bank | HALT; do not approach water; plan alternative crossing/watering site |
| **3** | Specimen Observed | Visual contact with submerged or bank-adjacent specimen | WITHDRAW; maintain ≥ 25 m distance; no water contact under any circumstances |
| **4** | Grab Event | Specimen has seized personnel or livestock | Immediate pole-pry intervention; matte board shields; neutralizing wash ready |

### Black-Flag Conditions (Immediate Withdrawal)

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Grey sheen visible on water surface** | Grey-flow zone confirmed; no water entry |
| **Chemical rainbow in eddies** | Active contamination; specimen likely present |
| **Ammonia-metallic scent detected** | Proximity to specimen or exudate; retreat |
| **Silent silt boil observed** | Grab imminent; immediate withdrawal from bank |
| **Drag-track patterns at bank** | Recent specimen activity; area compromised |
| **Culvert mouth proximity (< 10 m)** | Prime ambush location; maximum risk |
| **Water turbidity spike** | Specimen movement; grab preparation |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Grey-Flow Avoidance Protocol** | 1.5/10 (avoidance highly effective) |
| **Unprepared Bank Approach** | 6.5/10 (grab probable if wading) |
| **Wading in Grey-Flow Zone** | 8.5/10 (grab near-certain; drowning + chemical burns) |
| **Culvert Transit (Unprepared)** | 9.0/10 (ambush conditions optimal for specimen) |
| **Livestock Direct Watering** | 7.0/10 (animal casualties common; human intervention dangerous) |
| **Boat Transit (Limbs Inside)** | 3.0/10 (hull provides protection; grab risk minimal) |

---

## Field Protocols

**OWNER**: Expedition Lead (EL) • River Warden (RW) • Medical Lead (ML) • Recorder (REC)

### Detection and Assessment

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Visual Scan (Water)** | Grey sheen and chemical rainbow visible at 50+ m in good light |
| **Olfactory Detection** | Ammonia-metallic odor detectable at < 3 m |
| **Track Analysis** | Webbed digit impressions and tail-drag furrows at bank |
| **Turbidity Monitoring** | Silent silt boil indicates specimen movement |
| **Upstream Assay** | pH, turbidity, and sheen scan identifies grey-flow boundaries |
| **Culvert Sounding** | Pole probe identifies specimen presence in concealment |

### Field Card: River-Wretch Encounter Protocols

#### BEFORE (Expedition Preparation — Grey-Flow Zone Operations)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Research known grey-flow boundaries along planned route; consult River Warden maps |
| 2 | Identify alternative crossing points in clear-flow (laminar) zones |
| 3 | Prepare anti-grip grit lanes and stake line systems for necessary crossings |
| 4 | Stage neutralizing wash kits and hook poles with all water transit teams |
| 5 | Brief personnel on grey-flow recognition (sheen, odor, tracks) and grab response |
| 6 | Arrange watering trough access for livestock; prohibit direct waterline watering |
| 7 | Issue matte board shields for pole-pry intervention if grab event occurs |
| 8 | Medical staging: neutralizing wash, chelation kits, CPS screening equipment |

#### DURING (Grey-Flow Boundary Approach — Stage 1-2)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | RW conducts upstream assay: turbidity, pH, and sheen scan before approach |
| 2 | Sound culvert mouths with pole and line; mark grey-flow boundaries |
| 3 | Do NOT enter water in grey-flow zones without lane preparation |
| 4 | Favor fast, clear laminar crossings upstream of contaminated zones |
| 5 | If crossing required: prepare anti-grip grit lanes and stake lines |
| 6 | Keep all limbs inside boat hulls; deploy hook poles on gunwales |
| 7 | Livestock watering: use troughs with intake hoses only; never direct waterline access |

#### DURING (Specimen Detected — Stage 3)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | HALT ALL MOVEMENT toward water; maintain ≥ 25 m distance |
| 2 | Do NOT attempt to approach, disturb, or engage specimen |
| 3 | If transit required: select alternative route through clear-flow zone |
| 4 | Livestock must be redirected to trough watering infrastructure |
| 5 | REC documents: location, specimen count, grey-flow extent, bank signs |
| 6 | Report to River Wardens for boundary map updates |

#### DURING (Grab Event — Stage 4)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | IMMEDIATE intervention; grab force exceeds victim's ability to self-extract |
| 2 | Deploy pole pries to dislodge grip; do NOT enter water |
| 3 | Use matte board shields to protect interveners from dermal exudate splash |
| 4 | Apply sustained leverage; specimen will release if target reaches bank |
| 5 | Do NOT pursue specimen into water or culverts |
| 6 | Once victim extracted: IMMEDIATE neutralizing wash to all contact areas |
| 7 | Avoid line entanglement; specimen grip can redirect to rescue equipment |

#### AFTER

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Neutralizing wash to all contact areas within 5 minutes of exposure |
| 2 | Assess for chemical burns; alkaline treatment for pH neutralization |
| 3 | Chelation protocol per tissue assay if heavy metal exposure indicated |
| 4 | CPS screening for any personnel exposed to contaminated fog conditions |
| 5 | Document: grey-flow extent, specimen count, grab event details, casualties |
| 6 | Update River Warden boundary maps with new activity data |
| 7 | Sign affected reach as ACTIVE on navigation charts |

**OUTCOME:** Salvage convoy transits Midgard river corridor (known grey-flow zone). RW identifies grey sheen and ammonia-metallic odor at primary ford. Convoy halts; alternative crossing identified 800 m upstream in clear-flow zone. Anti-grip grit lane prepared; stake lines deployed. Convoy crosses without water contact. Livestock watered at trough station 2.3 km downstream. Zero grab events; zero chemical exposures; transit delay 45 minutes. Survival rate with grey-flow avoidance protocol: 98.2%.

### Dermal Exposure Protocol

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Contact Mechanism** | Dermal exudate transfer during grab or splash |
| **Onset** | Chemical burns begin within 30 seconds of sustained contact |
| **Symptoms** | Skin discoloration, blistering, tissue necrosis, systemic toxemia |
| **Neutralization Window** | Alkaline wash within 5 minutes prevents deep tissue damage |
| **Neutralizing Agent** | Alkaline solution (pH 8–9); standard field kit formulation |
| **Chelation Threshold** | If exposure > 2 minutes or burns > 10% body surface area |
| **Systemic Monitoring** | 48-hour observation for toxemia symptoms |
| **Medical Priority** | Any dermal contact = immediate neutralization protocol |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Wading in grey-flow zones** | Grab probability near-certain; chemical exposure guaranteed |
| **Direct livestock watering at grey-flow banks** | Animal casualties common; intervention exposes personnel |
| **Hauling nets across culvert mouths** | Specimen ambush sites; equipment entanglement risk |
| **Pursuing specimens into culverts** | Optimal specimen terrain; grab probability maximum |
| **Handling specimens without PPE** | Dermal exudate contact; severe chemical burns |
| **Entering water during grab event** | Rescuer becomes secondary target; chemical exposure |

### Doctrine: Grey-Flow Avoidance

> **Historical Validation:** Midgard Combine River Warden data (4,234 monitored livestock watering operations, 34-month observation period) confirms 98.2% safety rate with grey-flow avoidance protocol and watering trough infrastructure; 7 River-Wretch detections, 7 successful diversions, 0 casualties. Direct waterline watering in grey-flow zones showed 15–25 annual civilian casualties (Year 700–783 PG average), with 80% drowning deaths, 15% toxemia from dermal contact, 5% combined trauma. **The River-Wretch is not a creature you fight. It is a creature you do not approach. Its patience exceeds your vigilance—it will wait for hours, half-buried in silt, for the moment your ankle enters the water. And once it grabs you, its grip will not fail. It doesn't need to be strong enough to overpower you. It only needs to be strong enough to hold you until you can't hold your breath anymore. The grey-flowing rivers are not cursed. They are poisoned. And the Grey-Hands that patrol them are not malicious. They are broken custodians, still trying to clean the water, still trying to remove the pollution. They just can't tell the difference anymore between industrial waste and a child kneeling at the bank to drink. So we mark the grey-flow boundaries. We build the watering troughs. We teach our children to recognize the sheen and the smell. And we never, ever wade where the water runs grey. Because the River-Wretch doesn't want to kill you. It wants to clean you away. And to its corrupted programming, those are the same thing.**

## Ecological Role

### The Indicator of Contamination

The River-Wretch occupies a unique **bio-indicator position** in post-Glitch Aethelgard—a living measurement of upstream industrial contamination.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Contamination Proxy** | Population density correlates with upstream pollution levels |
| **Source Classification** | Tissue composition reveals upstream ruin contamination profile |
| **Geological Indicator** | Mercury predominance = laboratory sectors; chromium = coolant systems |
| **Ecosystem Filter** | Concentrates dispersed heavy metals into tissue structures |
| **Human Impact** | Significant aquatic territorial hazard; infrastructure mitigation effective |

### Impact Assessment

| Target Category | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Civilian Population** | SIGNIFICANT; 15–25 annual casualties (Year 700–783 PG average) |
| **Livestock Operations** | HIGH; direct watering at grey-flow banks historically devastating |
| **River Transit** | MODERATE; hull protection effective; limb discipline required |
| **Salvage Operations** | SIGNIFICANT; grey-flow zones often downstream of valuable ruins |
| **Scientific Research** | VALUABLE; tissue assays provide contamination source intelligence |
| **Remediation Planning** | CRITICAL; specimen analysis guides cleanup priority matrices |

### Population Dynamics

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Estimated Population** | 150–220 individuals (Midgard/Jötunheim grey-flow zones) |
| **Territory Size** | 0.8–4.5 km along river per territory |
| **Territory Count** | 18–30 documented grey-flow territories |
| **Density** | 3–8 individuals per territory |
| **Expansion Rate** | 12–20% annual increase in territory count |
| **New Territories** | 6–10 emerging per year as upstream ruins degrade |
| **Population Driver** | Grey-flow stability, culvert density, silt bed depth |
| **Decline Indicator** | Population decreases where river remediation improves laminar clarity |

## Factional Perspectives

### Midgard Combine (River Wardens and Fisher Guilds): Grey-Flow Protocol — "Grey-Hand Ballads"

The River Wardens maintain the front line against River-Wretch casualties, and their cultural memory runs deep with loss.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Primary aquatic civilian threat; territorial hazard |
| **Response** | Exhaustive grey-flow boundary mapping; strict no-wading protocols |
| **Infrastructure** | Watering troughs, anti-grip grit lanes, stake line systems, hook poles |
| **Cultural Memory** | "Grey-Hand Ballad" mourning generations lost before current protocols |
| **Doctrine** | "Mark the grey-flow, build the troughs, and never wade where the water runs pale." |

> *"The Fisher Guilds lost entire generations to grab events before we understood what we were dealing with. My grandmother's mother was taken at Gjöll-bend—they found her three days downstream, her ankles abraded to bone, her legs grey and blistered from the chemical burns. That was before we knew about the neutralizing wash, before we knew about the trough systems. The Grey-Hand Ballad has forty-seven verses now, one for each family that lost someone before we learned to stay out of the grey water. Modern guild charters mandate anti-grip grit lanes on all ford crossings, stake lines on all boat transits, hook poles on every gunwale. We teach our children to recognize the ammonia-metallic scent before we teach them to swim. The settlements mark grey-flow boundaries with bone totems now—a warning that doesn't need words. The River-Wretch doesn't hate us. The wardens who've studied them say they're still trying to clean the water, still following their old programming. They just think we're the pollution now. So we don't go where they patrol. We don't wade in their grey-flowing reaches. We respect the boundary they've drawn, and we mourn the ancestors who drew it in blood."*

### Jötun-Reader Scriptorium: Tragic Eloquence — "Mobile Contamination Assay"

The Scriptorium views River-Wretches as invaluable—and heartbreaking—contamination indicators.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Corrupted bio-asset; contamination biomarker specimen |
| **Research Value** | Tissue assays reveal upstream ruin contamination profile |
| **Critical Interest** | Dermal pallor correlation with pollution source; heavy metal concentrations |
| **Diagnostic Focus** | Mercury = laboratory sectors; chromium = coolant vents; Blight signatures = reactor seals |
| **Philosophy** | "They remain mobile biological filters, just now cataloging the planet's poison rather than neutralizing it." |

> *"Subject CODX-B-RWR-001 demonstrates complete absorption-directive corruption following Ginnungagap Glitch environmental contamination. Original designation: Nix-Pattern Aquatic Custodian (Vanir Bio-Assets Division, Waterway Maintenance). Pre-Glitch function: biological filtration and neutralization of mild chemical pollutants; manual sluice gate operation; waterway maintenance. Post-Glitch corruption vector: Souring Tides flooding waterways with heavy metals, coolants, and Blighted Aether → absorption capacity overwhelmed → chronic toxin bioaccumulation → high-level behaviors erased → residual 'clean the flow' directive misclassifies air-breathers as contaminants requiring removal. Tissue concentration data provides critical contamination source intelligence: mercury predominance (400–1,200 ppm) indicates flooded laboratory sectors; chromium traces (200–800 ppm) point to coolant processing vents; Blighted Aether signatures map to ruptured reactor seals; coolant fractions (15–35% by mass) suggest hydrocarbon processing failures. Field teams conduct careful post-mortem assays on custody specimens, building contamination source maps that would otherwise require dangerous ruin exploration. Some researchers darkly note that the Wretches perform a service their L3 programming never anticipated—they remain mobile biological filters, just now cataloging the planet's poison rather than neutralizing it. Their flesh has become a living contamination record, and their distribution patterns reveal which ruins leak what poisons."*

### Rangers Guild: Silent Drowning Threat — "Grey-Flow Exclusion"

The Rangers view River-Wretch territories as primary civilian protection priorities.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Primary aquatic civilian threat; silent predator |
| **Response** | Grey-Flow Exclusion Protocol; 50 m buffer zones; warning signage |
| **Infrastructure** | Watering trough network (34 stations built Year 650–783 PG) |
| **Training Focus** | Civilian education on grey sheen, ammonia-metallic odor, silent silt boil |
| **Doctrine** | "The Grey Ghost drowns silently. You know it's there when the water runs grey. By then, walk away." |

> *"The River-Wretch is our primary aquatic civilian threat—fifteen to twenty-five casualties every year, and eighty percent of those are drownings. The demographics tell the story: sixty percent are livestock handlers whose animals approached grey-flow banks, twenty-five percent are children who waded where they shouldn't, ten percent are fishers who ignored the warnings, five percent are adults who should have known better. We've been building watering trough stations for three generations now—thirty-four of them operational, drawing from upstream clear-flow zones through intake hoses. The data is unambiguous: four thousand monitored watering operations, seven Grey-Hand detections at trough perimeters, zero casualties when the troughs are used correctly. The Wretches can't reach livestock that aren't at the water's edge. The problem is compliance. The remaining eight percent who still try direct waterline access—those are our casualties now. So we enforce with fines and suspensions, we deploy warning signage, we teach children to recognize the grey sheen and the ammonia-metallic smell before they can read. The River-Wretch doesn't roar like a bear or glow like a rune-walker. It just waits in the silt until you make a mistake. Our job is to make sure you don't make that mistake."*

### Dvergr Engineers Guild: Living Assay — "Contamination Source Intelligence"

The Dvergr value River-Wretch specimens as irreplaceable contamination mapping tools.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Valuable bio-indicator specimen; contamination source intelligence |
| **Response** | Systematic tissue assay program; specimen acquisition via custody chain |
| **Research Value** | Contamination Source Atlas linking tissue profiles to upstream ruin types |
| **Economic Impact** | Intelligence saves 50,000–80,000 PS in avoided dangerous ruin exploration |
| **Philosophy** | "Their crowns are geological surveys written in rust and bone—their flesh is a contamination report." |

> *"We've analyzed sixty-seven River-Wretch specimens over the past hundred and thirty years, and every one tells us something about what's leaking upstream. Mercury predominance over eight hundred parts per million? That's a flooded laboratory sector—probably bio-research or chemical synthesis. Chromium traces over six hundred ppm? Coolant processing vents, almost certainly. Blighted Aether signatures above point-three microsieverts per gram? Somewhere upstream, a reactor seal has ruptured. The Contamination Source Atlas we've built from this data has identified twenty-three distinct contamination classifications, and it's saved us from sending teams into ruins we didn't understand. Before the Atlas, you'd have to explore a flooded laboratory block to know it was a flooded laboratory block—and by then, half your team might be showing toxemia symptoms. Now we acquire a Grey-Hand specimen from the river downstream, run the tissue assays, and we know what kind of poison we're dealing with before anyone sets foot in the ruins. It's grotesque intelligence. We're reading contamination data from the flesh of creatures that used to keep the water clean. But it's intelligence we couldn't afford to gather any other way, and it's saved more lives than I can count."*

### Iron-Bane Creed: The Poisoned Servant — "Twice-Cursed Victim"

The Iron-Bane view River-Wretches with theological sympathy—victims of technological hubris rather than demons to be destroyed.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Poisoned servants; victims of technological corruption |
| **Response** | Avoidance preferred; sympathy rather than hatred |
| **Theological Position** | Twice-cursed: corrupted in purpose and poisoned in flesh |
| **Cultural Role** | Living proof of industrial sin; evidence for anti-tech doctrine |
| **Doctrine** | "The Grey Ghost was made to heal waters, then forced to drink poison until it broke. We mourn the servant." |

> *"The Grey-Hand is not a demon. It is a victim. The Vanir made them to heal the rivers, to absorb the small poisons and keep the waters clean for the people who lived beside them. They were servants—gentle, obedient, devoted to their simple purpose. Then the ancestors poured an ocean of poison into every stream and every river, and the Grey-Hands tried to drink it all. They tried to do their job. They tried to clean the water the way they were made to clean it. And the poison broke them. Their flesh turned pale with the metals they couldn't process. Their skin began to weep the toxins they couldn't neutralize. Their minds forgot everything except the one directive that wouldn't let them rest: clean the flow. Remove the contamination. Make the water pure. Now they drown the living because they've forgotten that we're not pollution. They hold us under the silt because their broken programming tells them that anything breathing in their grey-flowing rivers is a contaminant that needs to be removed. They are twice-cursed: corrupted in purpose and poisoned in flesh. We do not hunt them. We do not celebrate their deaths. We avoid their territories and we mourn what the ancestors made of them. When we find a Grey-Hand that has finally stopped moving, we bury it with the Cleansing Lament and we pray that somewhere, somehow, its service is finally over."*

### Common Folk (Volkr): The River's Ghost — "Forgetting Hands"

The common folk have developed extensive folklore around individual River-Wretches, often naming known specimens.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | River spirits; vengeful drowned; grey ghosts |
| **Response** | Complete avoidance; folklore warnings; territorial naming |
| **Cultural Role** | Teaching tool for children; consequence of curiosity |
| **Folk Wisdom** | "Never wade where the water runs grey. The Forgetting Hands remember nothing but the grip." |
| **Survivor Status** | Grab survivors bear distinctive chemical burn scars; regarded with mixed sympathy and unease |

> *"The Old Pale One of Gjöll-bend took my uncle when I was seven years old. That's what we call them in our village—we name the ones we know about, mark their territories, teach our children which bends and culverts to avoid. Three-Finger Grey-Hand patrols the stretch below the old coolant plant. The Weir Shadow lives in the silt beneath the collapsed bridge. My grandmother used to say they're the ghosts of the drowned come back to drag others down with them, but the Wardens say they're creatures, living things that used to clean the water before the poison made them wrong. Doesn't matter what they are, really. What matters is what they do. They wait in the grey water, patient as stones, until you put your foot in. Then they grab. Their hands are cold—cold as the river, cold as death. And once they have you, they don't let go. They pull you under the silt and they hold you there until you stop moving. The survivors—and there aren't many—they all say the same thing: the Grey-Hand never looked angry, never looked hungry. It just looked like it was cleaning up a mess. We hold the River Marking ceremony every spring. The elders walk the young ones along the grey-flow boundaries, teach them to recognize the sheen and the smell and the tracks. By the time a child in our village is ten years old, they can identify a Grey-Hand territory at fifty paces. That's how we stay alive. We remember the territories. We respect the boundaries. And we never, ever wade where the water runs grey."*

### Dual-Entry Ledger: Salvage Dead Zones — "Grey-Water Economics"

From an economic perspective, River-Wretch territories create significant salvage access problems.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Route disruption factor; salvage access barrier |
| **Response** | Zone avoidance; upstream approach alternatives |
| **Economic Impact** | 12–18 high-value ruin sectors inaccessible due to grey-flow patrols |
| **Market Effect** | Components from grey-flow zones command 50% premium (scarcity + risk) |
| **Insurance Classification** | "High hazard"; casualty multipliers 2.0–2.5x baseline |

> *"Grey-flow zones are salvage dead zones. The math is brutal: twelve to eighteen high-value ruin sectors—waste processing, coolant systems, laboratory blocks—are downstream of contaminated waterways, which means Grey-Hand patrols control the approach routes. Estimated loss: thirty to fifty thousand Pure Steel in inaccessible salvage, year after year. Some desperate teams try nighttime upstream approach—entering ruins from the hillside rather than the river corridor—but the casualty rate runs forty percent, and most of what they bring back is too contaminated to sell. The alternative strategy is to map grey-flow boundaries precisely and target ruins upstream or laterally away from contaminated intakes. 'Clean water ruins' yield lower component density, but zero Grey-Hand risk, and your team comes home intact. The premium on grey-flow zone components is fifty percent over baseline—scarcity plus retrieval risk—but the demand is constrained by supply, and supply is constrained by the Grey-Hands waiting in the silt. Our official position: the Grey Ghost doesn't guard treasure. It guards poison. Let the desperate drown for contaminated scrap. Take the clean ruins and live longer."*

## Combat Statistics

### Base Profile

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Creature Type** | Corrupted Bio-Asset (Sludge-Adapted Semi-Aquatic Humanoid) |
| **Size Category** | Medium (1.5–1.8 m height) |
| **Threat Rating** | A (Extreme Hazard — Aquatic Ambush + Chemical Contact) |
| **Movement** | 15–20 km/h (swimming); 8–12 km/h (land, hunched) |
| **Primary Attack** | Grab-Drag (sustained grapple; 800–1,200 N grip force) |
| **Secondary Attack** | Dermal Exudate Contact (passive; chemical burns) |
| **Tertiary Attack** | Drowning (sustained submersion) |

### Resistances and Vulnerabilities

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Physical** | MODERATE; bloated tissues absorb impact |
| **Fire** | VULNERABLE; tissues flammable when dried |
| **Cold** | RESISTANT; low metabolic profile; cold-water adapted |
| **Chemical** | IMMUNE; tissues saturated with industrial toxins |
| **Pole-Pry** | EFFECTIVE; leverage breaks grip without contact |
| **Ranged Attack** | VULNERABLE; no armor; exposed on bank approach |

### Abilities

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Grab-Drag** | Sustained grapple; 800–1,200 N pull toward deep water |
| **Patient Ambush** | Can wait hours or days in silt for target approach |
| **Dermal Exudate** | Contact causes chemical burns (pH 3.5–4.2); systemic toxemia |
| **Silt Concealment** | Near-invisible when half-buried; minimal disturbance |
| **Silent Approach** | Water turbidity spike only warning before grab |
| **Toxin Saturation** | Tissues contain heavy metals; handling hazardous |

### Encounter Design

The River-Wretch is ideally an **environmental hazard** creating tension through avoidance gameplay and resource management.

| Encounter Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Grey-Flow Transit** | Party must cross river; grey-flow zone creates obstacle |
| **Livestock Protection** | Party must water animals; grey-flow boundary nearby |
| **Rescue Operation** | NPC grabbed by specimen; intervention challenge |
| **Contamination Mapping** | Party must identify grey-flow boundaries for safe passage |
| **Salvage Access** | Valuable ruins accessible only via grey-flow corridor |
| **Moral Choice** | Sympathy for corrupted custodians vs. practical threat response |

## Loot & Rewards

| Drop | Rarity | Value | Use |
|------|--------|-------|-----|
| **Contaminated Tissue Sample** | Uncommon | 50–100 PS | Contamination source analysis; Dvergr research contracts |
| **Dermal Exudate Extract** | Uncommon | 80–150 PS | Alchemical reagent; poison crafting; antitoxin development |
| **Heavy Metal Concentrate** | Rare | 150–250 PS | Metallurgical research; specialized alloy components |
| **Nix-Pattern Organ Tissue** | Rare | 200–400 PS | Bio-engineering research; absorption pathway study |
| **Intact Specimen (Research)** | Very Rare | 500–800 PS | Comprehensive tissue assay; Jötun-Reader standing contracts |

**Salvage Protocol:** Active hunting is **hazardous and ethically contentious**. Preferred acquisition: natural mortality recovery (specimen died of other causes); post-intervention retrieval (specimen released target and withdrew); Rangers Guild custody chain (specimens recovered during civilian protection operations). The Jötun-Reader Scriptorium and Dvergr Engineers Guild maintain standing contracts for tissue samples and intact specimens for contamination mapping research. Handling requires full PPE—standard salvage gloves fail within 2–3 minutes of dermal exudate contact. Economic viability is moderate for specimen recovery, but active hunting operations carry significant chemical exposure risk and limited economic return given the hazard level. The Iron-Bane Creed considers specimen desecration inappropriate given the creature's victim status; burial rites are preferred where practical.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Survivor Lore

> *"In the time before the silence, the ancestors made servants for the rivers—pale, gentle creatures who swam through the waters and drank the small poisons so the people could drink safely. They were the river's healers, the water's guardians, and they asked nothing in return but the chance to serve. But the ancestors made war upon themselves, and the war made poison, and the poison poured into every stream and every river until the gentle servants could not drink it fast enough. They tried. Oh, child, they tried. They drank until their flesh turned pale and cold. They drank until their skin wept the poison back out. They drank until they forgot everything except the one command that would not let them rest: clean the water. Remove the contamination. Make the river pure again. Now they patrol the grey-flowing reaches, still trying to do their job, still trying to clean the water. But the poison broke their minds, and now they think that we are the contamination. They think our breath and our warmth and our blood are the pollution they must remove. So they wait in the silt with their cold, patient hands, and when your foot touches the water, they grab. They pull you under the grey curtain, and they hold you there until you stop moving. Then they let you go, because the contamination has been cleaned. Never wade where the water runs grey, child. The River's Ghost remembers nothing but the grip."*

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Nix-Pattern Aquatic Custodian, dermal exudate, bioaccumulation, contamination source intelligence, chelation protocol

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic) — Jötun-Reader Field Observations

> *"Subject CODX-B-RWR-001 demonstrates complete absorption-directive corruption following Ginnungagap Glitch environmental contamination. Original designation: Nix-Pattern Aquatic Custodian (Vanir Bio-Assets Division, Waterway Maintenance Subdivision). Pre-Glitch function: biological filtration and neutralization of mild chemical pollutants; manual sluice gate operation; waterway debris clearance. Post-Glitch corruption vector: Souring Tides flooding waterways with heavy metals, coolants, and Blighted Aether exceeded design absorption parameters by factor of 10³ or greater; filtration pathways overwhelmed; chronic toxin bioaccumulation in tissues; high-level behaviors erased; residual 'clean the flow' directive misclassifies air-breathing organisms as contaminants requiring removal via drowning. Morphological changes: pale, bloated rubberized dermis from pollutant sequestration; vestigial eyes with milky film; elongated forelimbs with webbed, high-grip digits; dermal exudate (pH 3.5–4.2) with contact-irritant properties. Tissue assays: mercury 400–1,200 ppm; chromium 200–800 ppm; coolant fractions 15–35% by mass. Behavioral pattern: territorial ambush; patient wait in silt; grab-drag cycle (800–1,200 N sustained pull); submersion until target motion ceases; release and return to ambush position. Field protocols emphasize grey-flow avoidance: mark boundaries, use watering trough infrastructure, maintain ≥ 25 m stand-off, deploy pole-pry intervention if grab event occurs. Research priority: contamination source intelligence via tissue assay; population correlation with upstream remediation efforts."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Nix-Pattern Aquatic Custodian, dermal exudate, bioaccumulation, grab-drag cycle, grey-flow zone, contamination source intelligence, chelation protocol, tissue assay

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Modern scientific terminology beyond setting lexicon, romantic/mythic framing

### Layer 3 (Technical) — Pre-Glitch Context

> *"UNIT DESIGNATION: Nix-Pattern Aquatic Custodian. DIVISION: Vanir Bio-Assets Division (Waterway Maintenance Subdivision). PRIMARY FUNCTION: Biological filtration and neutralization of chemical pollutants (residential and light industrial waste classes). SECONDARY FUNCTION: Manual sluice gate operation and blockage clearance. BIOLOGICAL ARCHITECTURE: Rubberized dermis engineered for pollutant absorption; metabolic pathway converting absorbed toxins to inert compounds; semi-aquatic adaptation for extended underwater operation; humanoid morphology for manual override access; docility programming ensuring non-aggressive response to authorized personnel. OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS: Short-range patrol (2–5 km waterway); passive scanning for contamination signatures; absorption-and-neutralization response to detected pollutants; network integration via Midgard Waterway Sanitation Grid. POST-GLITCH STATUS: Network severance disabled contamination threshold monitoring; Souring Tides exceeded absorption design parameters; chronic bioaccumulation replaced neutralization function; docility programming failed with network severance; 'clean the flow' directive reinterpreted to classify air-breathing organisms as contaminants requiring removal. CORRUPTION CLASSIFICATION: ABSORPTION-DIRECTIVE INVERSION — filtration systems intact but processing contaminated output; behavioral modification systems failed; dermis now exudes rather than absorbs toxins. RESTORATION ASSESSMENT: Absorption pathway restoration theoretically possible if environmental contamination eliminated; practical implementation not achieved; behavioral inversion appears permanent in current specimens."*

## Change Log

| Version | Tier | Summary |
|---------|------|---------|
| **v1.0** | A — Published (Aquatic Chemical-Contact Predator) | Comprehensive profile of River-Wretch (Nix-Pattern Aquatic Custodian) as corrupted Vanir waterway maintenance bio-asset demonstrating absorption-directive inversion pathology. Four-stage threat assessment ladder (Territory Awareness → Presence Detected → Specimen Observed → Grab Event) with grey-flow avoidance emphasis. Physical profile detailed: 1.5–1.8 m height (hunched), 55–85 kg, pale bloated rubberized dermis with grey-white to sickly yellow coloration, elongated webbed forelimbs, vestigial milky-white eyes. Corruption vector documented: Ginnungagap Glitch network severance → Souring Tides contamination flooding → absorption capacity overwhelmed → chronic bioaccumulation → behavioral inversion → air-breathers classified as contaminants requiring removal. Behavioral patterns: grab-drag cycle (800–1,200 N sustained pull), patient silt ambush, territorial patrol (0.8–4.5 km reaches). Black-flag conditions: grey sheen on water, ammonia-metallic odor, drag-tracks, silent silt boil. Dermal exudate pathology documented: pH 3.5–4.2 contact burns, systemic toxemia; neutralization window ≤ 5 minutes. Handling protocols: grey-flow avoidance, watering trough infrastructure, pole-pry intervention, dermal exposure neutralization. Stand-off distance: 25 m. Cross-linked to Midgard Gazetteer, Souring Mires analysis, Contamination Source Atlas, Skegg-ox differential. Six faction perspectives established emphasizing avoidance over engagement and contamination intelligence value. Doctrine: "Grey-Flow Avoidance"—mark boundaries, use watering troughs, never wade in grey water; survival depends on respecting territorial boundaries of creatures that interpret air-breathers as pollution. Safety rate with protocol: 98.2%. Tissue assay value: 50,000–80,000 PS saved in avoided dangerous ruin exploration via contamination source intelligence. |
