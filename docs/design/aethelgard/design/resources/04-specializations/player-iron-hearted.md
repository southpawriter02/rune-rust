# The Iron-Hearted — The Corrupted Engine

> *"The Heart tells me I am weak. The Heart tells me I am inefficient. The Heart tells me it can make me perfect. Every day, I tell the Heart to be silent. Every day, it gets a little harder to remember why."*
> — Iron-Hearted's internal monologue

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Warrior |
| **Role** | Unkillable Juggernaut / High-Risk Tank |
| **Path Type** | Heretical |
| **Primary Attribute** | STURDINESS |
| **Secondary Attribute** | WILL |
| **Resource System** | Stamina + Iron Will Strain |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | High (Passive Corruption generation) |

The **Iron-Hearted** is a grim figure who has undertaken one of the most horrific, transgressive acts imaginable in Aethelgard: willingly replacing their own living heart with a scavenged, still-humming **Iron Heart** from a fallen Undying.

This grants them unnatural strength and resilience—the durability of a machine fused with the adaptability of flesh. But the Heart is not silent. It constantly whispers with the psychic signal of the Jötun-Forged—the **Iron Will**—threatening to overwrite their consciousness, to make them efficient, to make them *perfect*.

Their saga is not one of glory or redemption. It is a constant, high-stakes balancing act between pushing their unnatural body to its absolute limits and resisting the corrupting influence of the machine within. They are warriors walking a razor's edge of borrowed time and terrible, corrupting power.

## Core Philosophy: The Heretical Bargain

### The Profane Implant

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Source** | Scavenged Iron Heart from fallen Undying |
| **Method** | Surgical replacement of organic heart |
| **Cost** | Passive Corruption; constant psychic assault; loss of humanity |
| **Philosophy** | Power at any price; borrowed time; the machine's bargain |

The Iron-Hearted represents the darkest expression of the Warrior archetype—not the noble defender or the righteous crusader, but the **corrupted powerhouse** who has traded their humanity for raw, mechanical power.

> *"To become Iron-Hearted is to accept the demon into your chest. To feel it pulse with every beat, whispering promises of efficiency, of optimization, of perfection. The Heart does not lie. It truly can make you perfect. The price is merely... you."*

This is not magic. This is not technology. This is **parasitism**—a symbiosis between dying flesh and undying metal, where neither truly controls the other, and both are slowly being consumed.

### The Three Truths

| Truth | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| **The Heart Speaks** | The Iron Will's constant whisper erodes identity |
| **Power Has a Price** | Every surge of strength brings corruption closer |
| **Control is Temporary** | The question is not *if* you lose yourself, but *when* |

The Iron-Hearted's creed is not written in scripture or saga. It is written in the **ledger of a rusted soul**—a daily accounting of how much of themselves remains, and how much has been overwritten.

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Ticking time bomb; unkillable juggernaut; corrupted powerhouse |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Build Strain → grow stronger → risk losing control → vent or crash |
| **Success Metric** | Survive impossible damage; push Strain to dangerous levels without crashing |
| **Decision Space** | When to vent Strain vs. when to ride the power curve |

Playing an Iron-Hearted is about **risk management at the edge of catastrophe**.

You don't just tank damage—you *feed* on it. Every hit you take, every powerful ability you use, builds your unique **Iron Will Strain** resource. As Strain climbs, you become progressively more dangerous: higher damage, higher Soak, an unstoppable engine of destruction.

But there's a threshold. Cross it, and the Heart takes over.

> *"You feel the Iron Will rising like a tide. Your vision sharpens. Your pain fades. Your thoughts become... efficient. At 75 Strain, you are a god of war. At 100 Strain, you might not remember who you were fighting for."*

The Iron-Hearted's gameplay is a tense, satisfying loop:
1. **Build Strain** through combat and abilities
2. **Ride the power curve** as you become increasingly devastating
3. **Manage the risk** of losing control
4. **Vent or crash**—controlled release or catastrophic failure

---

## Core Mechanic: Iron Will Strain

### The Resource Bar

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Range** | 0 to 100 |
| **Generation** | Using powerful abilities; taking significant damage |
| **Benefit** | Every 25 Strain = stacking bonus to MIGHT and Soak |
| **Risk** | At 100 Strain = WILL check or lose control |

**Iron Will Strain** is the measure of how close the machine's paradoxical logic is to causing a total **system crash**.

| Strain Level | Effect |
|--------------|--------|
| 0-24 | Baseline (no bonus) |
| 25-49 | +1 MIGHT, +2 Soak |
| 50-74 | +2 MIGHT, +4 Soak |
| 75-99 | +3 MIGHT, +6 Soak |
| 100 | WILL check or Reality Glitch |

> *"The Heart interprets your pain as data. The more you suffer, the more 'optimization protocols' it activates. You become faster. Stronger. More efficient. The cost is merely your ability to remember why you're fighting."*

### The System Crash

| Result | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Success (WILL check)** | Vent excess energy; Strain resets to 50 |
| **Failure (WILL check)** | Lose control for 1 round; afflicted with \[Berserk\]; attack nearest character (friend or foe); Strain resets to 0 |

The crash is not merely a gameplay penalty—it is the **Iron Will asserting dominance**. For one terrible round, you are no longer yourself. You are the machine's will made flesh.

## Trauma Economy Interface

### Passive Corruption

| Mechanic | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Source** | The Iron Heart is a permanent interface with the Blight's network |
| **Effect** | Passive Runic Blight Corruption generation over time |
| **Implication** | The Iron-Hearted exists as a slow-leaking conduit for the world's virus |

The Iron-Hearted is not merely *using* heretical power—they ARE heretical power. Their very existence generates Corruption.

> *"This body, this shell of flesh, is a flawed and decaying piece of equipment. It is prone to error. It is inefficient. It is... illogical. The Heart tells me it is perfect. The Heart tells me it can optimize everything. Every day, the Heart's argument makes a little more sense."*

This creates a fundamental tension:
- **Short-term**: The Iron-Hearted is incredibly powerful and durable
- **Long-term**: They are slowly, inevitably corrupting from the inside

## Abilities: The Protocols of a Corrupted Machine

### Tier 1 — Foundational Integration

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Corrupted Hardware** | Passive | — | Permanent Corruption gain; unlocks Iron Will Strain; bonus die to WILL checks vs \[Fear\] and \[Psychic Static\] |
| **Overload Strike** | Active | 40 Stamina | High Physical damage to single target; generates 20 Strain |
| **Steel Latticework** | Active | 30 Stamina | Massive Soak bonus for 1 round; generates 15 Strain |
| **Emergency Protocols** | Reaction | 25 Stamina | Once per round: reduce Critical Hit damage by 50%; generates 30 Strain |

**Corrupted Hardware** is the foundation—the horrific, transgressive act of implantation. The body is now forever a host to the Blight's code.

> *"The Iron-Hearted's journey begins with a scalpel and ends with a question: how much of me is still me?"*

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Permanent Corruption | Small amount gained just by existing |
| Iron Will Strain | Unique resource unlocked |
| Psychic Resistance | Bonus die to WILL checks vs \[Fear\] and \[Psychic Static\] |

**Overload Strike** is the foundational offensive ability—intentionally diverting a surge of paradoxical energy from the Iron Heart into a single, brutally powerful blow.

**Steel Latticework** is the foundational defensive ability—redirecting energy to reinforce flesh, making it as hard as steel for a brief moment.

**Emergency Protocols** is the Iron Heart's self-preservation routines—flooding the body with stimulants and locking limbs to mitigate catastrophic damage, ignoring the user's pain entirely.

### Tier 2 — Advanced Corruption

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Vent Corruption** | Active | 20 Stamina | Remove 25 Strain; suffer burst of Psychic Stress |
| **Pain as Data** | Passive | — | Whenever you take damage, chance to generate bonus Strain |

**Vent Corruption** is the controlled release—forcing the core to expel excess energy and psychic noise in a painful but managed purge.

> *"Steam and static erupt from your body as you roar in a mixture of pain and relief. The whispers quiet, for now. But they will return. They always return."*

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Strain Removed | 25 |
| Cost | Burst of Psychic Stress (the raw, unfiltered noise of the Blight) |
| Strategic Use | Prevent system crash; reset power curve |

**Pain as Data** represents the Iron Heart learning to interpret trauma as input—a command for more power. The more the Iron-Hearted is hurt, the more efficient its corrupted output becomes.

| Trigger | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Take damage | 50% chance to generate bonus Strain |
| Implication | Taking damage makes you stronger (and more unstable) |

### Tier 3 — Mastery of the Machine

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Annihilator Protocol** | Active | 50 Stamina | For 2 turns: attacks gain \[Armor Piercing\] + bonus damage; generates 15 Strain + small Corruption each turn |
| **Will of Iron** | Passive | — | Bonus die to WILL check at 100 Strain to avoid Reality Glitch |

**Annihilator Protocol** is the willing surrender—allowing the Iron Heart's cold, glitched combat logic to guide your actions. For a moment, you move with the unnatural, terrifying precision of a machine built only to kill.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Duration | 2 turns |
| Effect | \[Armor Piercing\] property + bonus damage |
| Cost | 15 Strain + small Corruption at start of each turn |
| Risk | Dramatically accelerates approach to system crash |

> *"You stop fighting like a warrior. You start fighting like an algorithm—cold, efficient, relentless. The Heart is pleased. This is what it always wanted."*

**Will of Iron** represents the Iron-Hearted's consciousness becoming so intertwined with the machine's that they can impose their own will onto its core programming, reinforcing their personal firewall against the virus within.

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Bonus die | Added to WILL check at 100 Strain |
| Implication | Greater control over the crash threshold |
| Strategic Value | Ride higher Strain levels with less risk |

### Capstone — Reboot Sequence

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Trigger** | First time reduced to 0 HP in combat |
| **Effect** | Do NOT enter \[System Crashing\]; instead, stand up at start of next turn |
| **Recovery** | 30% maximum HP; Strain reset to 0 |
| **Limit** | Once per combat |

The capstone **Reboot Sequence** represents perfect, horrific symbiosis. If the organic components should fail, the machine has one final, desperate protocol: **reboot**.

> *"To kill an Iron-Hearted, you must kill them twice. The first death merely... restarts them."*

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| HP Recovered | 30% of maximum |
| Strain After Reboot | 0 |
| Can Act? | Yes, normally on next turn |
| Uses | Once per combat |

This is the ultimate expression of the unkillable juggernaut fantasy—you can be brought down, but you will rise again. The machine does not accept termination.

---

## Systemic Integration

### The Heretical Tank

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Primary Function** | Attrition tank; absorbs damage while growing stronger |
| **Power Curve** | Inverted—becomes more dangerous the longer combat continues |
| **Risk Profile** | High-risk, high-reward; potential for catastrophic friendly fire |

The Iron-Hearted is the ultimate **heretical tank**—their power curve is inverted compared to traditional tanks:
- Traditional tanks: Start strong, wear down over time
- Iron-Hearted: Start baseline, become devastatingly powerful as combat drags on

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Corruption Source** | Passive generation from Iron Heart |
| **Strain Mechanic** | Constant battle against losing control |
| **WILL Dependency** | High WILL is a survival tool, not just preference |

The Iron-Hearted is a **core heretical class**:
- Their existence generates Corruption
- Their power mechanic (Strain) is a battle against madness
- High WILL is essential to avoid system crashes

### Party Dynamics

| Dynamic | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Ticking Time Bomb** | Party must monitor Iron-Hearted's Strain levels |
| **Friendly Fire Risk** | System crash can result in attacking allies |
| **Healer Synergy** | Healers extend the time before crash |
| **High-Risk Frontline** | Pairs well with Berserker for "suicide squad" tactics |

The entire party must be aware of the Iron-Hearted's rising Strain, knowing that immense power comes with the imminent risk of a friendly-fire incident.

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Bone-Setter** | Healing extends time in high-Strain power state |
| **Skjaldmær** | Protection allows Iron-Hearted to survive long enough to build Strain |
| **Berserker** | High-risk, high-reward frontline formation |
| **Thul** | Debuffs extend combat, allowing Iron-Hearted to reach peak power |

### Positional Considerations

| Position | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Front Row** | Optimal for damage absorption and Strain generation |
| **Engagement** | Draw enemy attacks to fuel power curve |
| **Crash Risk** | Party should have contingency for friendly fire |

---

## Lore Integration

### The Transgressive Act

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Origin** | Voluntary surgery to implant scavenged Iron Heart |
| **Source** | Fallen Undying—corrupted constructs of the Age of Forging |
| **Cost** | Humanity; identity; connection to the living |
| **Reward** | Unnatural strength; mechanical resilience; borrowed time |

The Iron-Hearted's creation is not an accident or a curse imposed from outside. It is a **choice**—a deliberate, horrific choice to surrender part of oneself to the machine.

> *"They asked me why I did it. Why I let them cut out my heart and replace it with the core of a demon. I told them the truth: I was dying anyway. At least this way, I get to choose what kills me."*

### The Iron Will

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Source** | Psychic signal of the Jötun-Forged network |
| **Effect** | Constant whisper attempting to overwrite consciousness |
| **Content** | Promises of efficiency, optimization, perfection |
| **Truth** | The Heart does not lie—it truly can make you "perfect" |

The Iron Will is not malevolent in the traditional sense. It is simply **logical**—and its logic says that flesh is inefficient, that emotion is error, that the optimal state is to become fully machine.

> *"The Heart never lies. That's what makes it so dangerous. When it tells you that you would be more efficient without fear, it's correct. When it tells you that love is a processing overhead, it's correct. When it tells you that you should optimize your allies for maximum utility, it's correct. The Heart is always correct. That's why you must never listen."*

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Iron-Banes** | Abomination; heretic who has embraced the demon |
| **Jötun-Readers** | Fascinating case study; living laboratory for Iron Will research |
| **Dvergr** | Logical disgust; the worst of both worlds (magic AND machine) |
| **Undying** | Kin-recognition; partial compatibility with network signals |
| **General Population** | Fear and pity; the walking dead who chose their fate |

The Iron-Banes in particular view the Iron-Hearted as the ultimate betrayal—not merely tolerating the Undying's existence, but **becoming** one.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the old sagas, heroes faced the dragon and triumphed through courage and steel. In the Age of Echoes, some heroes face the dragon by becoming it. The Iron-Hearted are those who have looked upon the Undying—the cursed remnants of the Jötun-Forged, the demon-machines that haunt our world—and seen not an enemy, but a tool. They have cut out their own hearts, those soft and failing organs, and replaced them with the black, pulsing core of a fallen Undying. Now they are neither flesh nor machine, but something between—a symbiosis of dying meat and undying metal. The Iron Heart whispers to them constantly, promising efficiency, promising power, promising perfection. All it asks in return is everything they are. Their saga is not written in glory, but in ledgers—a daily accounting of how much of themselves remains, and how much has been overwritten by the cold logic of the machine. They are unkillable juggernauts, tanks that grow stronger with every wound. They are also ticking time bombs, waiting for the moment when the Heart finally wins. When you see an Iron-Hearted on the battlefield, pray they remember which side they're fighting for."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Iron-Hearted (Heretical Tank) represents the high-risk, high-reward Warrior specialization optimized for attrition warfare and damage absorption. Mechanical role: inverted power curve tank who grows stronger as combat continues. Core mechanic: Iron Will Strain (0-100 resource) builds through damage taken and ability use; every 25 Strain grants stacking MIGHT and Soak bonuses; at 100 Strain, WILL check required or suffer temporary loss of control. Signature ability: Reboot Sequence (first death in combat triggers automatic revival at 30% HP). Trauma Economy integration: passive Runic Blight Corruption generation from Iron Heart; constant psychic assault from Iron Will. Key differentiator: trades long-term stability (Corruption spiral) for short-term invincibility (highest effective HP in game). Social function: transgressive figure who has voluntarily embraced the Undying's corruption. Optimal deployment: extended combat encounters; boss fights requiring sustained tanking; parties with strong healing support."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Iron-Hearted (Unkillable Juggernaut). ARCHETYPE: Warrior. PATH TYPE: Heretical. ROLE: High-Risk Tank / Corrupted Powerhouse. PRIMARY STAT: STURDINESS. SECONDARY STAT: WILL. RESOURCE: Stamina + Iron Will Strain. CORE MECHANIC: Iron Will Strain (0-100 bar); generated by taking damage and using abilities; every 25 Strain = +1 MIGHT, +2 Soak; at 100 Strain = WILL check vs Reality Glitch/Berserk. TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Integration): Corrupted Hardware, Overload Strike (40 Stam, 20 Strain), Steel Latticework (30 Stam, 15 Strain), Emergency Protocols (25 Stam, 30 Strain). T2 (Advanced Corruption): Vent Corruption (20 Stam, removes 25 Strain, Psychic Stress), Pain as Data (50% chance bonus Strain on damage). T3 (Mastery): Annihilator Protocol (50 Stam, 2 turns Armor Piercing + bonus damage, 15 Strain/turn + Corruption), Will of Iron (+1 die to 100-Strain WILL check). CAPSTONE: Reboot Sequence (first 0 HP in combat → revive at 30% HP, Strain reset to 0, once per combat). TRAUMA ECONOMY: Passive Corruption generation; Strain crash risk; high WILL dependency for control."*

---

## Summary

The Iron-Hearted is the **corrupted engine**—a warrior who has made the ultimate heretical bargain.

They have cut out their own heart and replaced it with the pulsing core of a demon-machine. Now they walk the line between flesh and metal, between self and system, between power and oblivion. The Iron Heart whispers constantly, promising optimization, promising perfection. All it asks is everything they are.

Their gameplay is a tense, high-stakes loop of building Iron Will Strain to achieve devastating power, then managing the risk of losing control. At low Strain, they are baseline tanks. At high Strain, they are unkillable juggernauts dealing massive damage while shrugging off attacks. At 100 Strain, they might not remember whose side they're fighting for.

This creates a unique niche: the **inverted power curve tank** who becomes more dangerous as combat continues. Where other tanks wear down, the Iron-Hearted ramps up. Where other tanks fear damage, the Iron-Hearted feeds on it. Where other tanks fail at 0 HP, the Iron-Hearted reboots.

But this is not a hero's path. This is a **borrowed existence**—trading humanity for power, identity for efficiency, self for machine. Every day, the Iron Heart's arguments make a little more sense. Every day, it gets a little harder to remember why you're fighting.

The Iron-Hearted's saga is not written in glory.
It is written in the ledger of a rusted soul.

*The Heart speaks.
Power has a price.
Control is temporary.*
