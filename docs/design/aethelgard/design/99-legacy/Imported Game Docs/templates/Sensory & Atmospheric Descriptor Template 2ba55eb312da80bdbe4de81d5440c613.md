## Intensity Guidelines

### Subtle Intensity

- Noticed only if paying attention
- Background ambiance
- Sets mood without demanding attention

**Example (Sound)**: "Water drips somewhere. A steady, patient rhythm."

### Moderate Intensity

- Clearly noticeable
- Contributes actively to atmosphere
- May hint at dangers or opportunities

**Example (Sound)**: "Metal groans overhead—this corridor is structurally compromised."

### Oppressive Intensity

- Demands attention
- Creates immediate emotional response
- Often indicates immediate danger or extreme conditions

**Example (Sound)**: "THE CURSED CHOIR SWELLS. Harmonies that should not exist tear at your sanity."

---

## Writing Guidelines

### Engagement Rules

1. **One sense per descriptor** (mixing happens at the system level)
2. **Immediate impact** - describe what's happening now
3. **Active voice** - "Water drips" not "Water is dripping"
4. **Specific details** - "rust flakes" not "debris"
5. **Emotional resonance** - what does this make the character feel?

### Avoid

- Generic descriptions ("it smells bad")
- Passive voice
- Over-explanation
- Breaking immersion with game terms
- Repetitive structures

### Sound-Specific Tips

- Use onomatopoeia sparingly but effectively
- Rhythm matters: "Plink. Plink. Plink."
- Direction and distance create spatial awareness
- Silence is a sound category

### Smell-Specific Tips

- Smells trigger memory and emotion
- Chemical/industrial smells suggest danger
- Organic smells suggest life or death
- Absence of smell is unsettling

### Atmosphere-Specific Tips

- Temperature affects everything
- Lighting defines visibility and mood
- Particles make air feel tangible
- Surface conditions affect movement
