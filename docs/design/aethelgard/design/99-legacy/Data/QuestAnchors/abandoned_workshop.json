  "Name": "[Abandoned Workshop]",
  "Description": "A makeshift repair bay carved from a collapsed maintenance tunnel. The walls are lined with salvaged tools, scavenged automaton parts, and jury-rigged diagnostic equipment. A Dvergr tinkerer has claimed this space as their refuge - one of the few living souls willing to delve this deep into [The Roots]. The air smells of hot metal and ozone from ongoing repair work.",
  "Archetype": "Chamber",
  "SuggestedNodeType": "Branch",
  "NarrativeText": "Grelda Ironbraid, a renegade Dvergr engineer, has been scavenging Pre-Glitch technology from the ruins for decades. She's remarkably pragmatic about the dangers - 'The servitors leave you alone if you don't threaten their patrol routes, and the Glitch-touched fauna are more afraid of you than you are of them.' She offers to upgrade equipment, trade crafting materials, or share knowledge of the ruins... for a price.",
  "FlavorText": "A workbench dominates the center, covered in half-disassembled servitor components. Emergency lighting powered by a salvaged Iron Heart reactor provides steady illumination. A warning sign in Old Aetheric reads: 'Touch nothing. Ask first. Pay always.'",
