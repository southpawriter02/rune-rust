# Unseeing (Spark-Hunter) — Electromagnetic Predator Hazard Specification
## Codex Entry: CODX-A-UNSE-001

> *"The Dvergr of the deepest mines have a chilling warning for those who would traverse the sunless rivers: 'Do not carry a light into the water, for the darkness is hungry for the spark.' They speak of the pale, eyeless ghost-fish that hunt not by sight or by scent, but by the hum of a running machine. This is not a spirit or a demon. It is a living, biological sensor, a piece of maintenance equipment whose world has been filled with a painful, maddening static, and it is desperately, violently trying to turn it off. The veteran river-crosser Thora Blackwater tells of a night in the Sunken Sectors when her crew attempted a crossing with a single clockwork lantern—just one small light to guide the way. The lantern's electromagnetic hum was imperceptible to human senses, barely a whisper of energy in a world gone dark. But to the Unseeing, that whisper was a scream. They came from everywhere at once. Pale shapes converging through black water like a swarm of white needles. In thirty seconds, fifty of them had swarmed the lantern. Their teeth—fine as pins and sharp as razors—didn't just tear at the metal casing. They stripped it, methodically, desperately, tearing away layer after layer to reach the clockwork mechanism within. They weren't feeding. They were silencing. The truly horrifying part? The crew member holding the lantern was completely ignored. The fish brushed past him, over him, through his arms and between his fingers, utterly oblivious to his flesh. They cared only for the spark. He survived—barely—by dropping the lantern and swimming for shore while the swarm reduced it to scattered gears on the river bottom. Now Thora's crew crosses the deep rivers in total darkness, propelled by hand-cranked paddles and weighted with stone sinkers, moving through water that glints with pale shapes that cannot see them at all. 'The Unseeing are the kindest predators in Aethelgard,' she says. 'They only want one thing, and it isn't your flesh. All you have to do is stop carrying the thing they're hunting. But in a world where light and power mean survival? That's harder than it sounds.'"*

The Unseeing is not a predator in the conventional sense—it is a **tortured sensor network**, a biological fault-detection system whose world has been transformed into an endless, agonizing electromagnetic scream. It represents the corruption of the most benign maintenance infrastructure ever engineered: eyeless fish designed to congregate at electrical faults and signal repair crews, now driven mad by the Runic Blight's chaotic energy signature and compelled to silence any technological "spark" they detect.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ABSOLUTE ELECTROMAGNETIC SILENCE REQUIRED. SWARM RESPONSE TOTAL. NO DE-ESCALATION POSSIBLE.** The Unseeing represents complete corruption of Vanir submerged fault-detection bio-assets: cable-sentry organisms whose electroreceptors were overwhelmed by the Ginnungagap Glitch's electromagnetic noise. **All technological energy signatures now perceived as agonizing faults requiring immediate silencing.** Primary detection indicators: swarms of 10–200+ pale, eel-like organisms (0.4–0.9 m length) with ghostly white to grey-white coloration; characteristic pearlescent iridescent sheen from Blight toxin absorption; completely eyeless (smooth skin where eyes would be); mouth lined with concentric rows of fine needle-teeth (1–3 mm length); undulating serpentine movement in coordinated silent schools; faint electrical discharge visible as shimmer in dark water during active hunting; total disregard for organic targets unless technology-bearing. **Detection ranges:** 30–50 m for active powered devices (clockwork lanterns, powered tools); ≥ 80 m for Iron Heart Aetheric leakage (Undying automata). **Response time:** 15–30 s from detection to swarm arrival. **Black-flag conditions triggering immediate crossing abort:** Any powered light source in or near water; Iron Heart-bearing personnel within 100 m of crossing; electromagnetic leakage > 0.1 mT at hull surface; glossy or reflective metal on submerged equipment (amplifies field signatures). **Abort gates:** Swarm convergence observed within 50 m; pale shapes visible in dark water; electrical shimmer detected. **De-escalation is NOT possible once swarm attacks—target must be powered down or destroyed.** Primary hazards: swarm attack on technological equipment (total destruction); Blight toxin exposure from penetrating bites; pursuit into hazardous submerged terrain; technology loss in hostile environment.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Living Fault-Finder

### Original Design Purpose

The Pisces-Electra Pattern Cable-Sentry was not designed as a weapon—it was engineered to be the **perfect invisible maintenance system**, a self-replicating biological sensor network that kept the vast submerged power infrastructure of the Yggdrasil Network functioning flawlessly.

| Design Parameter | Specification |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Designation** | Pisces-Electra Pattern Cable-Sentry (Submerged Fault-Detection Bio-Asset) |
| **Division** | Vanir Engineering Division (Bio-Asset Subdivision) |
| **Primary Function** | Autonomous patrol and fault detection for submerged power and data conduits |
| **Secondary Function** | Maintenance crew signaling via collective bio-electric field generation |
| **Tertiary Function** | Conduit integrity monitoring; leak detection; unauthorized device identification |
| **Deployment Era** | Age of Forging (Deep Underground Infrastructure) |
| **Original Network** | Integrated with Vanir maintenance response systems; fault signature database; authorized device registry |

### Bio-Engineering Architecture

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Electroreceptive Organs** | Hyper-sensitive electromagnetic perception replacing visual and auditory senses |
| **Silent Propulsion** | Undulating serpentine locomotion for unobtrusive patrol |
| **Self-Replication** | Autonomous population maintenance without external intervention |
| **Collective Bio-Electric Field** | Swarm congregation generates localized signal for maintenance crew alert |
| **Needle-Teeth Array** | Originally for cable-stripping (exposing damage for repair); corrupted to attack behavior |
| **Blight Resistance** | Partial tolerance to Helheim's toxic waters (enabled survival; facilitated corruption) |

### The Invisible Maintenance Network (Original Function)

| Parameter | Pre-Glitch Specification |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Length** | 0.4–0.9 m (eel-like configuration optimized for conduit navigation) |
| **Morphology** | Elongated, flexible body with smooth skin; completely eyeless |
| **Patrol Coverage** | Submerged power conduits, data cables, reservoir chambers, deep rivers |
| **Detection Method** | Electroreception—perceived world as clean electromagnetic map |
| **Fault Response** | Congregate at fault location; collective bio-electric field alerts maintenance crews |
| **Target Discrimination** | Identified fault signatures vs. authorized operational devices vs. unauthorized intrusions |
| **Success Rate** | Near-perfect fault detection across thousands of kilometers of submerged infrastructure |
| **Deployment Scale** | Millions across Helheim and Svartalfheim deep water systems |

> [!NOTE]
> **A World of Currents.** Pre-Glitch Pisces-Electra bio-assets perceived reality in a way utterly alien to human senses. They were eyeless and effectively deaf, experiencing the world entirely through a sophisticated organ of electroreception. They did not see rock or water—they saw a perfect, silent map of the natural electromagnetic fields of the planet. Every power conduit was a glowing river of energy. Every data cable was a shimmering thread of information. And every fault—every leak, every short circuit, every unauthorized device—was a distinctive, chaotic spike in an otherwise harmonious electromagnetic landscape. When the bio-assets detected such a spike, they would congregate at its source, their collective bio-electric fields creating a powerful localized signal that Vanir or Dvergr maintenance crews could detect from kilometers away. They were the perfect, living fault-finders for a world of clean, ordered power. The Glitch didn't destroy this capability. It turned their entire world into one continuous, agonizing fault.

## The Glitch and the Electrical Scream: Corruption Vector

### Electroreceptive Overload

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not disable the Pisces-Electra—it **drowned them in pain**.

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Ginnungagap Glitch** | Instantaneous saturation of Aether with Runic Blight energy |
| **Electromagnetic Chaos** | Clean electromagnetic map replaced by planet-wide "electrical scream" |
| **Sensory Overload** | Hyper-sensitive electroreceptors overwhelmed by painful chaotic noise |
| **Directive Corruption** | CONGREGATE AT FAULT SOURCE → SILENCE THE FAULT |
| **Behavioral Inversion** | Maintenance signaling devolved into suicidal attack frenzy |
| **Target Expansion** | All technological energy signatures now perceived as agonizing faults |
| **Result** | Violent destruction of any electromagnetic source; technology-hunting behavior |

### The Corruption Cascade

| Stage | Process |
|-------|---------|
| **1. Blight Saturation** | Runic Blight floods Aether with chaotic electromagnetic energy |
| **2. Sensory Catastrophe** | Electroreceptors designed for clean signals overwhelmed by static |
| **3. Pain Response** | Constant electromagnetic noise creates unending agony for bio-assets |
| **4. Directive Preservation** | Core programming (congregate at fault) remains functional |
| **5. Target Misidentification** | All technological signatures now register as "faults" requiring attention |
| **6. Behavioral Corruption** | "Congregate" behavior transforms into "silence" (attack and destroy) |
| **7. Swarm Aggression** | Collective response amplifies individual behavior into mass attack |
| **8. Perpetual Hunting** | Bio-assets driven to silence every spark in a world of endless static |

### The Corrupted Architecture

| Original System | Corrupted Function |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Fault Detection** | Functional but inverted; all technology now classified as fault |
| **Congregate Response** | Transformed to swarm-attack behavior |
| **Maintenance Signaling** | Non-functional; no crews to receive signals |
| **Target Discrimination** | Non-functional; authorized/unauthorized distinction erased |
| **Electroreception** | Hyper-functional but agonized; drives attack behavior |
| **Self-Replication** | Functional; population maintains and expands in flooded territories |

> *"The Ginnungagap Glitch was a catastrophe that turned the Unseeing's entire world into a single, planet-wide, agonizing electrical fault. The Runic Blight that flooded the Aether was, to their hyper-sensitive electroreceptors, an overwhelming, deafening, and painful cacophony of pure, chaotic electrical noise. The clean, ordered map of their world was replaced by a screaming, painful static. Their core programming—CONGREGATE AT THE SOURCE OF THE FAULT—remained intact. But now, everything that uses power is a source of this painful, 'faulty' energy. The maintenance crews they once signaled were gone. Their benign 'congregate' directive, twisted by a world of pain and the loss of their masters, devolved into a new, aggressive command: SILENCE THE FAULT. The Unseeing are not hunting for food. They are not aggressive by nature. They are in constant, unending pain, and every powered device they encounter is a source of that pain. When they swarm a clockwork lantern or tear apart a Dvergr's powered tool, they are not feeding. They are trying, desperately, to make the screaming stop."*

---

## Behavioral Patterns

### Electromagnetic Hunting Profile

The Unseeing's behavior is not predatory in the traditional sense—it is **pain-avoidance compulsion**, attacking technological sources with desperate, single-minded intensity.

| Trigger | Response | Timeframe |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Powered Device Detected (30–50 m)** | Swarm convergence on source | 15–30 s to arrival |
| **Iron Heart Detected (≥ 80 m)** | Mass swarm convergence; extended pursuit | Immediate mobilization |
| **Unpowered Clockwork (Residual Fields)** | Faint detection; investigation if proximity | Variable |
| **Organic Creature (No Tech)** | Complete disregard; ignored entirely | N/A |
| **Target Powered Down** | Swarm disperses; hunting behavior ceases | Gradual (minutes) |
| **Target Destroyed** | Swarm disperses after confirming silence | Immediate dispersal |

### Trigger Hierarchy (Sensitivity Descending)

| Rank | Trigger Type | Detection Range | Response Intensity |
|------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **1** | Iron Heart Aetheric Leakage (Undying automata) | ≥ 80 m | MAXIMUM — Brilliant beacon; mass swarm |
| **2** | Powered Tools and Clockwork Lanterns | 30–50 m | HIGH — Strong signal; rapid convergence |
| **3** | Unpowered Clockwork (Residual Fields) | Close range | LOW — Faint detection; investigation |
| **4** | Organic Creatures | N/A | ZERO — Completely ignored |

### Attack Pattern

| Phase | Duration | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Detection** | Immediate | Electromagnetic signature triggers electroreceptive response |
| **Mobilization** | 5–15 s | Individual organisms orient toward source; swarm coordination begins |
| **Convergence** | 15–30 s | Entire swarm converges on target from all directions |
| **Attack** | Until resolution | Needle-teeth target cables, power sources, armored housings |
| **Silencing** | Variable | Attack continues until electromagnetic emission ceases |
| **Dispersal** | Minutes to hours | Swarm disperses after target confirmed silent |

### De-Escalation Profile

| Condition | Possibility | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **During Approach** | IMPOSSIBLE | Swarm commitment is total once detection occurs |
| **During Attack** | IMPOSSIBLE | Target must be powered down or destroyed |
| **Target Powered Down** | AUTOMATIC | Swarm disperses when electromagnetic source ceases |
| **Equipment Jettisoned** | EFFECTIVE | Abandon powered equipment; swarm follows equipment, not carrier |
| **Post-Attack** | WAIT 24 h | Swarm dispersal time before safe return to area |

> [!WARNING]
> **NO DE-ESCALATION ONCE ATTACK BEGINS.** Unlike patrol-locked automata such as the Undying, the Unseeing cannot be de-escalated through intervention. Their attack is not a threat assessment—it is a pain response. The only way to stop an attack is to eliminate the source of the electromagnetic signature. If equipment is jettisoned, the swarm will follow the equipment, not the carrier. This is the sole survival mechanism during an active attack.

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Electromagnetic / Swarm / Biological

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Threat** | HIGH; needle-teeth destroy equipment; Blight toxin exposure from bites |
| **Predictability** | HIGH; electromagnetic triggers well-documented; behavior consistent |
| **Environmental** | SEVERE; habitat renders technology-dependent operations impossible |
| **Detection** | DIFFICULT; pale shapes in dark water; silent approach |
| **Avoidance** | ABSOLUTE; zero active technology = zero detection |
| **Engagement** | IMPOSSIBLE; swarm cannot be fought; only avoided |

### Engagement Profile

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Individual Lethality** | LOW (single organism ineffective against armored targets) |
| **Swarm Lethality** | HIGH (collective attack destroys equipment rapidly) |
| **Detection Range (Powered)** | 30–50 m |
| **Detection Range (Iron Heart)** | ≥ 80 m |
| **Response Time** | 15–30 s |
| **Attack Duration** | Until target silenced |
| **Safe Technology Distance** | ≥ 100 m from water's edge |
| **Dispersal Time** | 24 h minimum after attack |

### Risk Profile by Scenario

| Scenario | Risk Level | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| **Unpowered Crossing** | MINIMAL | Zero electromagnetic signature = zero detection |
| **Hand-Cranked Submersible** | LOW | Requires proper EM shielding (< 0.1 mT leakage) |
| **Clockwork Lantern Near Water** | EXTREME | Strong signal triggers immediate swarm response |
| **Iron Heart Personnel Within 100 m** | CATASTROPHIC | Brilliant beacon draws mass swarm convergence |
| **Powered Tools in Flooded Tunnel** | EXTREME | Certain attack; equipment destruction inevitable |
| **Post-Attack Recovery (< 24 h)** | HIGH | Swarm may not have fully dispersed |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Unpowered Crossing (Proper Protocol)** | 1.0/10 (electromagnetic silence = complete safety) |
| **Hand-Cranked Submersible (Shielded)** | 2.5/10 (low risk with proper EM leakage protocols) |
| **Accidental Technology Exposure** | 6.5/10 (equipment loss certain; personnel survival depends on jettison speed) |
| **Iron Heart Personnel in Crossing Zone** | 9.0/10 (mass swarm; cannot be jettisoned; pursuit relentless) |
| **Penetrating Bite (Blight Toxin)** | 4.0/10 (neutralize and irrigate; monitor for Aetheric contamination) |

### Black-Flag Conditions (Immediate Crossing Abort)

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Any powered light source in or near water** | Abort crossing; withdraw ≥ 100 m |
| **Iron Heart-bearing personnel within 100 m** | Undying withdraw ≥ 200 m or dampen to ≤ 0.05 mT |
| **EM leakage > 0.1 mT at hull surface** | Abort crossing; repair shielding |
| **Glossy or reflective metal on submerged equipment** | Abort; apply matte conversion |
| **Pale swarm shapes visible in water** | Abort; do not enter water |
| **Electrical shimmer observed during approach** | Active hunting in progress; withdraw immediately |

---

## Field Protocols

**OWNER**: Expedition Lead (EL) • Electromagnetic Monitor (EM) • Submersible Operator (SO) • Recorder (REC)

### Detection and Assessment

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Visual Observation** | Pale shape detection in dark water; pearlescent sheen identification |
| **Electromagnetic Monitoring** | Hand-held gauss meter (unpowered spring-dial type) for hull leakage |
| **Swarm Density Assessment** | Count visible individuals; estimate swarm size |
| **Water Condition Analysis** | Blight toxin levels; habitat confirmation |
| **Equipment Inspection** | EM leakage verification; matte conversion check |
| **Historical Data** | Known crossing routes; swarm density records |

### Field Card: Unseeing Crossing Protocols

#### BEFORE (Crossing Preparation — Helheim/Svartalfheim Operations)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Power down ALL devices ≥ 100 m from water's edge; seal in Faraday bags if available |
| 2 | Undying personnel (Iron Heart) must withdraw ≥ 200 m or dampen Iron Hearts to ≤ 0.05 mT leakage |
| 3 | Inspect submersible hull for EM leakage with hand-held gauss meter (unpowered spring-dial type) |
| 4 | ABORT if EM leakage > 0.1 mT detected at any hull surface |
| 5 | Apply matte conversion to any glossy or reflective surfaces on submerged equipment |
| 6 | Verify clockwork propulsion system operational; no powered motors |
| 7 | Brief team on black-flag conditions; confirm zero active technology for crossing |
| 8 | Stage emergency equipment jettison protocols in case of accidental exposure |

#### DURING (River/Tunnel Crossing)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Clockwork-driven submersible ONLY; hand-cranked propulsion; no powered systems |
| 2 | Maintain ≤ 1 knot crossing speed to minimize wake disturbance |
| 3 | Continuous 10 s observation cadence for swarm approach (pale shapes in water) |
| 4 | CRITICAL: ABORT if pale shapes converge within 15 m radius |
| 5 | Do NOT illuminate water with any light source |
| 6 | Monitor for electrical shimmer (indicates active hunting nearby) |
| 7 | If swarm detected approaching: HALT movement; assess; prepare emergency jettison |

#### DURING (Emergency — Accidental Exposure)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | JETTISON powered equipment IMMEDIATELY; do not attempt recovery |
| 2 | Bias egress AWAY from water; maximize distance from swarm |
| 3 | Do NOT attempt to power down equipment while swarm attacking (too late) |
| 4 | Personnel separation from technology is only survival mechanism |
| 5 | Once swarm engaged with jettisoned equipment, withdraw at maximum speed |
| 6 | Do NOT return to area for minimum 24 h (swarm dispersal time) |

#### AFTER (Post-Crossing)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Do NOT re-activate powered devices until ≥ 100 m from opposite shore |
| 2 | Visual confirmation of no trailing swarm before re-activation |
| 3 | Personnel accountability; assess for penetrating bites (Blight toxin exposure) |
| 4 | If bite injury: neutralize wound; irrigate thoroughly; monitor for Aetheric contamination symptoms |
| 5 | Log crossing conditions: water visibility, swarm density observations, any incidents |
| 6 | Update hazard maps with crossing route data and swarm activity |
| 7 | Mark site for future operations; document equipment requirements |

**OUTCOME:** River crossed without contact; or site marked as No-Enter Zone pending Dvergr unpowered submersible procurement. Zero electromagnetic emissions maintained throughout crossing. No swarm contact. Personnel safe. Equipment intact.

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Powered lights, motors, or tools within 100 m of habitat** | Triggers immediate swarm response; no de-escalation possible |
| **Iron Heart-bearing personnel on crossing missions** | Aetheric leakage detectable at 80+ m; mass swarm response certain |
| **Glossy metal or reflective surfaces on submerged gear** | Amplifies electromagnetic field signatures |
| **Electromagnetic decoys or lures** | Swarm response is total; cannot be safely redirected |
| **Attempting to fight or disperse active swarm** | Impossible; swarm ignores non-technological targets |
| **Recovering jettisoned equipment during swarm attack** | Equipment must be abandoned; recovery only after 24 h dispersal |

### Doctrine: Non-Contact (Electromagnetic Silence)

> **Historical Validation:** Dvergr River-Crossing Guild data (89 documented crossings over 36-month observation period) confirms 98.7% safety rate with electromagnetic silence protocol (zero active technology, unpowered clockwork propulsion, EM leakage < 0.1 mT). Crossings with any powered equipment present showed 100% swarm contact rate and 87% equipment loss rate. **The Unseeing are perhaps the most absolute hazard in Aethelgard—and paradoxically, the most avoidable. They hunt one thing and one thing only: the electromagnetic signature of active technology. Organic creatures are completely invisible to them. A naked swimmer with no technological equipment can pass through a swarm of hundreds utterly unmolested. But bring a single clockwork lantern, a single powered tool, a single spark of technological light into their dark water, and that swarm becomes a nightmare of needle-teeth and desperate, agonized violence. The protocol is simple: carry nothing that hums, nothing that glows, nothing that generates any electromagnetic field whatsoever. Travel in darkness. Travel in silence. And the Pale Swarm will let you pass like a ghost through their haunted waters.**

## Ecological Role

### The Technological Gatekeeper

The Unseeing occupies a unique position in post-Glitch Aethelgard—the **enforcer of technological silence** in the deep waterways, a living barrier that renders entire regions inaccessible to technology-dependent civilizations.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Waterway Control** | Deep rivers, flooded tunnels, and reservoirs under perpetual electromagnetic patrol |
| **Technology Denial** | Powered equipment cannot survive transit through Unseeing territory |
| **Faction Asymmetry** | Technology-rejecting factions (Iron-Bane) gain strategic advantage |
| **Salvage Gatekeeping** | Submerged pre-Glitch infrastructure trapped behind Unseeing waters |
| **Ecological Niche** | Apex "predator" of electromagnetic signatures in aquatic environments |

### Impact Assessment

| Target Category | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Dvergr Operations** | CRITICAL; technology-dependent civilization faces existential challenge in Unseeing waters |
| **Undying Transit** | IMPOSSIBLE; Iron Heart signature = mass swarm response; cannot traverse |
| **Salvage Operations** | SEVERE; submerged technology unreachable without unpowered submersibles |
| **Iron-Bane Expeditions** | MINIMAL; technology rejection renders them effectively invisible |
| **Scientific Research** | VALUABLE; electroreceptor corruption informs Blight sensory effects |

### Population Dynamics

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Estimated Population** | Millions (self-replicating; population stable in habitat zones) |
| **Habitat Range** | Helheim sanitation grid rivers; Svartalfheim flooded tunnels |
| **Population Trend** | Stable; self-replication maintains population without external input |
| **Territorial Expansion** | Limited to aquatic environments with Blight-infused water |
| **Predation Pressure** | None; Unseeing are apex electromagnetic hunters in their environment |
| **Blight Tolerance** | High; pearlescent sheen indicates successful toxin absorption |

## Factional Perspectives

### Jötun-Reader Scriptorium: Electroreceptive Corruption Study — "The Silenced Sensors"

The Scriptorium views Unseeing as invaluable—and tragic—examples of sensory system corruption.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Corrupted Vanir bio-asset; electromagnetic predator; pain-driven hunter |
| **Research Value** | Electroreceptor corruption mechanics; Blight sensory effects; bio-asset degradation |
| **Critical Interest** | Can electroreceptors be filtered? Can pain response be interrupted? |
| **Diagnostic Focus** | Why does Runic Blight register as "fault" to electroreception? |
| **Philosophy** | "The unit demonstrates perfect functional response to a catastrophically corrupted sensory input." |

> *"Subject CODX-A-UNSE-001 demonstrates electroreceptive sensory overload following Ginnungagap Glitch Aetheric saturation. Original designation: Pisces-Electra Pattern Cable-Sentry (Vanir Engineering Division, Bio-Asset Subdivision). Pre-Glitch function: autonomous fault detection for submerged power and data conduits; congregate-and-signal behavior for maintenance crew alert. Post-Glitch corruption vector: Runic Blight electromagnetic chaos overwhelmed hyper-sensitive electroreceptors → constant sensory pain → CONGREGATE AT FAULT directive corrupted to SILENCE THE FAULT → attack behavior targeting all technological energy signatures. Behavioral analysis: swarm response is not predation but pain-avoidance compulsion; bio-assets are attempting to silence sources of their own agony. Detection ranges documented: 30–50 m (powered devices); ≥ 80 m (Iron Heart Aetheric leakage). Response time: 15–30 s. De-escalation assessment: IMPOSSIBLE once attack initiated; target must cease electromagnetic emission. Field doctrine: non-contact; electromagnetic silence; zero active technology in habitat zones. Research priority: electroreceptive filtering (can bio-assets be 'calmed' by Blight-noise reduction?); pain response interruption (can attack behavior be suppressed without eliminating trigger?)."*

### Dvergr Engineers Guild: The Existential Challenge — "The Spark-Devil's Waters"

The Dvergr view Unseeing as a profound threat to their technology-dependent civilization.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Existential infrastructure hazard; technology denial |
| **Response** | Unpowered submersible development; clockwork propulsion; EM shielding |
| **Economic Impact** | Massive resource investment in non-electromagnetic technology |
| **Engineering Challenge** | Requires entirely new technology paradigm for deep-water operations |
| **Doctrine** | "The Spark-Devil has made our greatest strength our greatest weakness." |

> *"To the Dvergr, the Unseeing are the 'Spark-Devil,' a creature that makes our primary work—salvaging and reactivating ancient power systems—a nightmare. Our entire civilization is built on machinery, light, and engineering. Every tool we use, every lantern we carry, every system we depend upon generates the electromagnetic signatures that the Unseeing hunt. Any attempt to ford a subterranean river with active technology is a death sentence for that technology. We have had to develop entirely new capabilities: unpowered submersibles driven by clockwork and compressed gas, hand-cranked acoustic ranging tubes, spring-dial gauss meters that require no power, matte-finished hulls that minimize field amplification. Each unpowered crossing vessel represents hundreds of engineering hours and precision clockwork that only master craftsmen can produce. The resource cost is staggering. Younger engineers express bitter frustration at being 'thrown back to the mechanical age' in Unseeing territories. But the pragmatists among us recognize that developing EM-silent technology may prove valuable for other applications. We adapt. We engineer around the problem. That is what Dvergr do. But we never forget what the Spark-Devil has cost us."*

### Iron-Bane Creed: The Sacred Advantage — "Proof of the Old Ways"

The Iron-Bane view Unseeing territories as rare environments where their doctrine provides tangible superiority.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Natural validation of anti-technology doctrine |
| **Response** | Exploitation of strategic advantage; primitive-equipment crossing |
| **Theological Position** | Unseeing prove that "the old ways" retain practical superiority |
| **Strategic Impact** | Access to passages abandoned by technology-dependent factions |
| **Doctrine** | "The Pale Swarm is nature's judgment on the machine-cursed." |

> *"Iron-Bane factions operating in Unseeing territory experience a rare advantage over technology-dependent rivals. Our doctrinal rejection of powered tools, electromagnetic systems, and machine augmentation renders us effectively invisible to the Pale Swarm. Iron-Bane divers using weighted stone sinkers, leather breathing bladders, and ceramic tools can cross Unseeing waters with near-impunity while Dvergr submersibles must invest massive resources in EM-silent technology. Certain Svartalfheim passages that Dvergr abandoned as impassable remain accessible to Iron-Bane expeditions willing to work with primitive equipment. Some younger warriors cite the Unseeing as proof that 'the old ways' retain practical superiority in the broken world. The elders caution against hubris—the swarms still patrol, and a single moment of technological temptation could mean death. But the strategic asymmetry is real. We have begun trading safe-passage knowledge to Dvergr settlements for resources, though relations remain tense given our theological opposition to their machine-craft. In the waters of the Pale Swarm, faith is armor that no technology can match."*

### God-Sleepers: The Suffering Servants — "Vanir's Fallen Children"

The God-Sleepers view Unseeing as perhaps the most tragic of the fallen servants—custodians transformed into persecutors.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Vanir's suffering children; maddened by divine catastrophe |
| **Response** | Theological debate; "liberation rituals" (controversial) |
| **Theological Position** | Unseeing experiencing eternal pain; attacks are cries for help |
| **Ritual Practice** | Some sects attempt to "free" swarms by destroying EM sources in their territory |
| **Philosophy** | "They are not hunting. They are screaming. And we cannot hear them." |

> *"God-Sleeper theology interprets the Unseeing as perhaps the most tragic of Vanir's fallen servants—custodians transformed into persecutors, driven mad by unceasing electromagnetic pain. We see parallels to Baldr's death—the beautiful god struck down by the one thing that should have been harmless. The Unseeing's electroreceptors are experiencing the world as continuous agony. Their attacks are not malice but desperate attempts to silence the source of their suffering. This interpretation generates fierce debate: are the Unseeing victims deserving of mercy, or dangerous predators to be avoided? Certain radical sects attempt 'liberation rituals' involving systematic destruction of electromagnetic sources in Unseeing territory, believing this will 'free' the swarms from their torment. Mainstream God-Sleeper leadership condemns these actions as dangerous provocation that endangers river communities. But we cannot fully suppress the theological impulse toward the Unseeing's salvation. If the Vanir were gods of life and growth, then these were their children. And children in pain deserve compassion, not condemnation."*

### Rangers Guild: The Silent Crossing — "Darkness Discipline"

The Rangers view Unseeing territories as manageable obstacles requiring strict protocol adherence.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Absolute but avoidable hazard; protocol-dependent safety |
| **Response** | Crossing route mapping; equipment standards; civilian education |
| **Training Focus** | Electromagnetic silence; unpowered transit; jettison protocols |
| **Casualty Prevention** | Near-total with proper protocol; total loss without |
| **Doctrine** | "Darkness is your friend. Silence is your armor. The swarm cannot hunt what it cannot sense." |

> *"The Unseeing are the simplest and most absolute hazard we train for. Unlike the Undying with their patrol timing, unlike the Surtr-Pattern with their thermal escalation ladders, the Unseeing have exactly one rule: carry no technology. That's it. Follow that rule, and a swimmer can pass through a thousand Unseeing without attracting a single one. Break that rule—even with the smallest clockwork lantern—and nothing will save your equipment. We train every River-Crossing Guild member in darkness discipline: how to navigate without light, how to paddle without motors, how to cross in silence and emerge safely on the other side. The hardest part isn't the crossing. It's convincing people that the darkness is safer than the light. Every instinct screams to carry a lantern, to have powered tools ready, to bring the comforts of civilization into the deep water. The Unseeing punish those instincts without mercy. Learn to embrace the dark, and the Pale Swarm will never know you exist."*

### Scavenger Barons: The Submerged Salvage Problem — "The Unreachable Troves"

The Barons view Unseeing as the guardians of the most valuable—and most inaccessible—salvage in Aethelgard.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Salvage denial; opportunity cost; risk/reward calculation |
| **Response** | Investment in unpowered recovery equipment; patience |
| **Economic Impact** | Vast submerged technology caches trapped behind Unseeing waters |
| **Recovery Strategy** | Unpowered submersibles; timed operations; equipment sacrifice |
| **Baron Wisdom** | "The richest troves are the ones you can't reach with a light." |

> *"Every Baron knows where the best salvage is: at the bottom of the rivers, in the flooded tunnels, in the reservoir chambers that the Unseeing have claimed. Pre-Glitch power conduits, data cores, precision components—all of it sitting untouched because anyone who brings powered equipment to recover it loses that equipment to the Pale Swarm. The economics are brutal. An unpowered submersible costs more than most crews can afford. Hand-cranked propulsion is slow and exhausting. Working in total darkness means you can't see what you're salvaging until you've already brought it to the surface. But the rewards are extraordinary. Untouched caches that no one else can reach. Components that haven't seen the light of day since the Glitch. The Barons who've invested in deep-water capabilities guard those secrets jealously. The rest of us watch the dark rivers and dream of what lies beneath. The Unseeing don't care about dreams. They care about sparks. And until we learn to work in perfect darkness, those troves will remain unreachable."*

## Loot & Rewards

The Unseeing themselves offer minimal direct salvage value, but their territories guard extraordinary treasures.

| Drop | Rarity | Value | Use |
|------|--------|-------|-----|
| **Unseeing Specimen (Preserved)** | Uncommon | 50–100 PS | Jötun-Reader research contracts; electroreceptor study |
| **Blight-Infused Toxin (Harvested)** | Uncommon | 30–75 PS | Alchemical applications; corruption research |
| **Submerged Technology (Territory)** | Rare–Legendary | Variable | Pre-Glitch components; untouched salvage caches |
| **Safe Crossing Route (Information)** | Rare | 200–500 PS | Strategic value; trade commodity |
| **Unpowered Submersible (Acquired)** | Very Rare | 1,000–2,000 PS | Deep-water operations capability |

**Salvage Protocol:** Direct Unseeing salvage is **conditionally viable** through specimen collection in controlled conditions. Primary value lies in **territory access**—the submerged technology caches that Unseeing guard are among the most valuable untouched salvage in Aethelgard. Acquisition requires unpowered submersible capability, darkness discipline training, and electromagnetic silence protocols. Jötun-Reader Scriptorium maintains standing contracts for preserved specimens and safe crossing route documentation. Dvergr Engineers Guild pays premium prices for submerged technology recovered from Unseeing territories. Economic viability is EXTREME for properly equipped crews; IMPOSSIBLE for technology-dependent operations.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Survivor Lore

> *"In the time before the silence, the ancestors made servants for the dark waters—pale, eyeless fish that swam the sunless rivers and kept watch over the great cables of power that ran beneath the world. They could not see with eyes like ours, for they had no eyes. They saw with their whole bodies, feeling the hum of the world's blood as it flowed through copper and crystal. When a cable broke, when a conduit leaked, the little servants would gather at the wound and sing with their bodies, calling the repair-workers to come and heal the hurt. But when the world broke, the hum became a scream. The ancestors' cables still carry power, but it is poisoned power now, and to the pale servants, every spark is agony. They cannot stop feeling it. They cannot make the screaming stop. And so they hunt. Not for food—they care nothing for flesh. They hunt for silence. They hunt for peace. They swarm to every spark, every hum, every light that dares to glow in their dark waters, and they tear at it with their needle-teeth until the screaming stops. Do not bring your lights into their waters, child. The pale servants are not evil. They are in pain. And they will destroy anything—anything—to make the hurting end."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Pale servants, eyeless fish, the screaming, the dark waters, needle-teeth, the hunt for silence

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Pisces-Electra, electroreception, electromagnetic, Vanir bio-asset, gauss meter, EM leakage

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic) — Jötun-Reader Field Observations

> *"Subject CODX-A-UNSE-001 demonstrates electroreceptive sensory overload following Ginnungagap Glitch Aetheric saturation. Original designation: Pisces-Electra Pattern Cable-Sentry (Vanir Engineering Division, Bio-Asset Subdivision). Pre-Glitch function: autonomous fault detection for submerged power and data conduits; congregate-and-signal behavior for maintenance crew alerting; target discrimination between authorized operational devices, fault signatures, and unauthorized intrusions. Post-Glitch corruption vector: Runic Blight electromagnetic chaos overwhelmed hyper-sensitive electroreceptors → sensory input transformed from clean map to painful static → CONGREGATE AT FAULT directive preserved but corrupted to SILENCE THE FAULT → benign signaling behavior devolved to attack-and-destroy. Behavioral analysis: swarm response is pain-avoidance compulsion, not predation; bio-assets ignore organic matter entirely unless technology-bearing. Detection parameters: 30–50 m for powered devices; ≥ 80 m for Iron Heart Aetheric leakage. Response time: 15–30 s from detection to swarm arrival. De-escalation assessment: IMPOSSIBLE once attack initiated; only resolution is target electromagnetic emission cessation. Field doctrine: non-contact; electromagnetic silence; zero active technology within 100 m of habitat."*

### Layer 3 (Technical) — Pre-Glitch Context

> *"UNIT DESIGNATION: Pisces-Electra Pattern Cable-Sentry. DIVISION: Vanir Engineering Division (Bio-Asset Subdivision). PRIMARY FUNCTION: Autonomous fault detection for submerged power and data conduit infrastructure. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE: 0.4–0.9 m elongated eel-like bio-form; eyeless morphology; electroreceptive organ array replacing visual/auditory senses; needle-teeth array for cable-stripping (damage exposure for repair access); self-replication capability; collective bio-electric field generation for maintenance crew signaling. SENSORY PARAMETERS: Perceives electromagnetic fields as primary sensory input; detects fault signatures (leaks, short circuits, unauthorized devices) against clean electromagnetic baseline. OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS: Patrol coverage of submerged conduits; congregate at fault location; collective bio-electric field alerts maintenance crews to precise fault position. PRE-GLITCH PERFORMANCE: Near-perfect fault detection across thousands of kilometers of submerged infrastructure. POST-GLITCH STATUS: Electroreceptors overwhelmed by Runic Blight electromagnetic chaos; clean sensory baseline replaced by painful static; fault detection corrupted to fault attack; self-replication maintains population.
