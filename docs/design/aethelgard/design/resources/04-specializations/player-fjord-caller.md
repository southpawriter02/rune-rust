The **Fjord-Caller** is the warden of an older, purer sound.

They are not Mystics who channel the tainted Aether. They are **Resonance Technicians**—master naturalists and musicians who have learned to use massive, resonant horns to replicate the infrasonic "Deep Song" of Aethelgard's colossal sea serpents. Their power is not a manipulation of corrupted code, but an application of **pure, uncorrupted physics**.

In a world saturated with the maddening, anti-logical scream of the Runic Blight, the Fjord-Caller's resonant horns create vibrations that **harmonize with the world's stable, foundational code**, temporarily overwriting the Blight's static in a localized area.

They are powerless in a desert. But on the coast, they are a god.

Their saga is a song of primal stability against a cacophony of corrupted data.

## Core Philosophy: The Art of the Deep Song

### The Three Principles

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **The Serpent's Bargain** | Feed the beast; receive its protection—survival through appeasement |
| **The Pure Frequency** | The world's original code still hums beneath the static; find it, mimic it, reassert it |
| **The Coast is Everything** | Your power is tied to the sea; away from water, you are merely a musician |

The Fjord-Caller's creed is not written in scripture or saga. It is written in the **language of resonance**—tide, tremor, the deep-water hum of leviathans, and the silence between waves.

> *"The ancestors watched as the great serpents ignored wooden fishing vessels but viciously attacked armored Aesir craft. The serpents did not hunger for flesh, but for metal. The first Fjord-Caller was a desperate fisherman who jettisoned his salvaged scrap to survive, brokering the first silent deal."*

This is not worship. This is not domestication. This is a **protection racket with a leviathan**.

The Fjord-Callers did not seek to conquer the horrors of the new world, nor did they pray to them. They made a deal. And in doing so, they have become the undisputed masters of the one thing everyone else has lost: the horizon.

### The Coherent Path

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Source** | Pure physics and naturalist observation, not heresy |
| **Method** | Resonant horn mimicry of primal, uncorrupted frequencies |
| **Cost** | Low Psychic Stress; Enrage Serpent carries moderate cost |
| **Philosophy** | The world's stable code still exists; tune to it, don't corrupt it |

Unlike the Rust-Witch who channels entropy or the Echo-Caller who weaponizes trauma, the Fjord-Caller maintains **coherent discipline**. Their horn's pure tones actively counteract the psychic noise of the Cursed Choir rather than amplifying it.

This is a sustainable path—demanding in its environmental requirements, but not self-destructive.

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Primal diplomat; master of a specific, devastating domain |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Position → call → control the environment → reshape the battlefield |
| **Success Metric** | Coastal encounters dominated; allies protected from Psychic Stress |
| **Decision Space** | Environmental positioning, ability timing, serpent risk management |

Playing a Fjord-Caller is about **turning the coastline into your personal weapon**.

You are the most situational but potentially the most powerful environmental controller in the game. In standard combat, you contribute modest support. But when the fight is near water, you become an unstoppable force multiplier—calling waves to reposition enemies, summoning the fury of sea serpents, and creating zones of pure resonance that shield your allies from the Blight's maddening static.

> *"Your horn is not an instrument of magic, but a sonic key that can pacify the rage of ancient beasts, call forth the fury of the tide, and enrage the great serpents of the deep. You are powerless in a desert, but on the coast, you are a god."*

Your power is environmental. The Fjord-Caller's gameplay is a puzzle of positioning and luring—maneuvering combat toward the coast where your abilities can reshape reality itself.

## Abilities: The Songs of the Sea

### Tier 1 — Foundational Calls

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Child of the Tides** | Passive | — | Immune to movement penalties from water/mist; passive Psychic Stress resistance |
| **Warning Horn** | Active | 40 Stamina | Low Sonic damage to Front Row; chance to inflict \[Disoriented\] for 1 turn |
| **Song of Passage** | Active | 35 Stamina | Out of combat; WILL check to pacify beast-type enemies, allowing passage |

**Child of the Tides** represents the Fjord-Caller's lifetime spent by the sea, their senses attuned to its pure, rhythmic hum. This connection grounds them against the world's chaotic static.

At higher ranks, this passive extends to include enhanced perception of underwater movement and automatic detection of serpent proximity—critical for navigating contested coastal waters.

**Warning Horn** is the bread-and-butter disruption ability—a short, sharp, deafening blast that mimics the warning call of a territorial sea creature. The pure, un-glitched sound is physically jarring to creatures accustomed to the Blight's noise.

> *"You sound a short, sharp blast—a sound that mimics the warning call of a territorial sea creature. The pure, coherent tone is jarring to creatures accustomed to the Blight's constant static."*

**Song of Passage** is the art of the primal truce. The Fjord-Caller plays a low, soothing melody that temporarily overwrites the agitating psychic static in the area, pacifying beasts that would otherwise attack on sight.

### Tier 2 — Advanced Songs

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Song of Sanctuary** | Active | 45 Stamina | Creates zone of Aetheric Stability; allies in zone have Psychic Stress negated |
| **Tidal Surge** | Active | 50 Stamina | \[Coastal\] only; Pull enemies from Back to Front Row; cleanse Corruption debuffs |
| **Voice of the Deep** | Passive | — | +1 turn duration on all debuffs and beneficial zones |

**Song of Sanctuary** is the Fjord-Caller's defining support ability—the creation of a "quiet zone" that acts as a temporary firewall against the eternal scream.

| Zone Effect | Duration |
|-------------|----------|
| Aetheric Stability | 2 turns (+1 with Voice of the Deep) |
| Psychic Stress Negation | Portion of incoming Stress negated |
| Position | Party's back row |

> *"You sound a deep, resonant note that creates a localized field of pure, stable vibration. This 'quiet zone' acts as a temporary firewall against the Blight's maddening influence."*

**Tidal Surge** is the signature environmental control ability—a deep note that vibrates in harmony with the sea itself, calling forth a powerful, cleansing wave.

| Effect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| Pull all enemies from Back Row to Front Row | \[Coastal\] environment |
| Cleanse one Corruption-based debuff | Resolve check |
| \[Knocked Down\] on enemies in Front Row | STURDINESS check |

> *"The wave does not merely reposition—it cleanses. Enemies hit by the pure, untainted tide may have corruption-based debuffs washed away."*

**Voice of the Deep** represents the Fjord-Caller's deepening mastery. Their calls resonate more perfectly with the world's stable code, extending the duration of all effects.

### Tier 3 — Mastery of the Coast

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Enrage Serpent** | Active | 65 Stamina | \[Coastal\] only; summon Sea Serpent for devastating AoE attack |
| **Shattering Chord** | Active | 60 Stamina | High Sonic damage; massive bonus vs Mechanical/Forlorn; chance \[Stun\] |

**Enrage Serpent** is the Fjord-Caller's most dangerous song—the aggressive, territorial roar of a colossal sea serpent, a sound of pure, untainted primal fury.

| Requirement | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| \[Coastal\] environment | Sea Serpent entity appears |
| Difficult WILL check | Devastating AoE attack against enemy party |
| Psychic Cost | Moderate Psychic Stress on the Fjord-Caller |

> *"You unleash the most dangerous song you know: the aggressive, territorial roar of a great sea serpent. If one is present in the region, it will hear the challenge and respond with mindless, destructive fury."*

**Warning:** In the original specification, Enrage Serpent could target friend or foe. The revised version directs the serpent's attack at enemies, but the terror of calling such a beast still inflicts Psychic Stress.

**Shattering Chord** is the precision strike ability—finding the precise resonant frequency of a corrupted machine or glitching metaphysical entity and unleashing a single, pure, sustained note designed to cause catastrophic system failure.

| Target Type | Bonus |
|-------------|-------|
| Standard | High Sonic damage |
| Mechanical | Massively increased damage |
| Forlorn | Massively increased damage |
| Critical Hit vs Mechanical/Forlorn | High chance \[Stun\] |

### Capstone — Song of the World-Serpent

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Cost** | 80 Stamina, once per combat |
| **Requirement** | \[Coastal\] environment |
| **For Allies** | Cleanse significant Psychic Stress; immunity to mental debuffs for 2 turns |
| **For Enemies** | High Sonic damage; \[Stunned\] for 1 turn |

The capstone **Song of the World-Serpent** represents the ultimate expression of the Fjord-Caller philosophy—the forbidden melody that mimics the deep, world-shaking groan of Jörmungandr, the mythical serpent whose rhythm set the original, stable code of reality.

> *"For a moment, you don't just mimic the song; you reassert it. You unleash a wave of pure, foundational resonance across the entire battlefield. Corrupted forms are temporarily overwhelmed by the pure, un-glitched logic of the world's intended state."*

This is not a call to a creature. This is a call upon **the spirit of the sea itself**—a momentary reassertion of the world's original code.

## Systemic Integration

### Environmental Dependency

| Environment | Fjord-Caller Capability |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Non-Coastal** | Tier 1 abilities only; significantly reduced effectiveness |
| **Coastal (Standard)** | Full ability access; standard effectiveness |
| **Coastal (Serpent Territory)** | Full access; Enrage Serpent available |
| **Deep Fjord** | Maximum effectiveness; Song of the World-Serpent at full power |

The Fjord-Caller's power is **environment-locked**. Their Tier 2 and higher abilities can only be used in a \[Coastal\] environment—any room directly adjacent to a large body of water (the sea, a fjord, a massive lake).

This creates a unique strategic niche: **the biome master** who transforms from modest support into a god-like controller based purely on positioning. A party with a Fjord-Caller will actively maneuver combat toward coastal areas.

**AI Counter-Play:** Intelligent enemies will recognize the threat of a Fjord-Caller. In coastal environments, the Fjord-Caller becomes a high-priority target. Enemies with Push or Pull abilities will actively try to move the Fjord-Caller *away* from the water's edge to disable their most powerful abilities.

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Coherent (minimal negative Trauma interactions) |
| **Self-Inflicted Risk** | Low-Medium (Enrage Serpent costs moderate Psychic Stress) |
| **Mitigation** | Child of the Tides provides passive Psychic Stress resistance |
| **Unique Feature** | Song of Sanctuary and Song of the World-Serpent actively reduce ally Psychic Stress |

The Fjord-Caller is a **Coherent** specialization with a unique defensive capability: they are one of the few specializations that can actively **reduce** Psychic Stress for their allies.

Song of Sanctuary creates zones of Aetheric Stability that negate incoming Psychic Stress. Song of the World-Serpent cleanses significant accumulated Stress from the entire party. This makes the Fjord-Caller invaluable for extended operations in high-Stress environments—provided those environments are coastal.

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Galdr-Casters** | Tidal Surge pulls enemies into water; lightning spells become devastating |
| **Controllers** | Formation disruption enables AoE roots, zones, and crowd control |
| **Tanks** | Tidal Surge repositions threats; Song of Sanctuary protects back line |
| **Trauma-Heavy Builds** | Song of Sanctuary and World-Serpent manage accumulated Psychic Stress |
| **Jötun-Readers** | Information sharing; coordinated analysis of serpent behavior |

The Fjord-Caller is the **master of setup**—repositioning enemies, disrupting formations, and creating opportunities for devastating follow-up.

> *"With Galdr-Casters: pull them into the water, then call the lightning. With Controllers: disrupt their formation, then root them in place."*

### Positional Considerations

| Position | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Near Water's Edge** | Full ability access; maximum effectiveness |
| **Away from Water** | Tier 1 only; significantly reduced power |
| **In Water** | Child of the Tides prevents movement penalties |

The Fjord-Caller is optimized for **coastal edge operation**—close enough to the water to call upon its power, positioned to project that power across the battlefield.

## Lore Integration

### Social Function in Aethelgard

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Gatekeeper** | Controls access to safe sea passage; no coastal travel without Fjord-Caller aid |
| **Ferrymen of the Damned** | Pilots outside ships through serpent-patrolled waters for exorbitant fees |
| **Tide-Sage** | Clan leadership role; reads "Wurm-Sign" to determine tribute timing |
| **Serpent-Pacter** | Maintains the Pact of Iron and Salt with the clan's patron Hafgufa |

The Fjord-Caller is not a lone operator. They are the product of an entire culture—the **Fjord-Caller clans** of Midgard's coast, who have survived by learning to pay the toll to the sea's new, armored kings.

> *"The Midgard Combine, the Dvergr, and even the Jötun-Readers are all utterly incapable of safe sea travel without Fjord-Caller aid. They operate a lucrative and dangerous trade as pilots, guiding outside ships through treacherous, serpent-patrolled waters."*

### The Pact of Iron and Salt

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **The Tribute** | Constant supply of high-quality scrap metal to the clan's patron Hafgufa |
| **The Guardian** | Well-fed Hafgufa views the clan's fjord as territory; attacks other threats |
| **The Gong of the Deeps** | Massive submerged resonant gong; signals tribute offering |
| **The Wurm-Sign** | Subtle shifts in tide and deep-water tremors; read by the Tide-Sage |

This is not friendship. This is not domestication. This is a **protection racket with a leviathan**.

> *"Each clan is bound to a specific, territorial Hafgufa. They must provide it with a constant, reliable supply of high-quality scrap metal—the 'Chum of Rust.' In return, the well-fed serpent views the clan's fjord as its territory and will fiercely attack any other threat that enters its waters."*

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Iron-Banes** | View symbiosis with "metal-scaled beasts" as heresy; rely on Callers for transport |
| **God-Sleepers** | Uncertain whether Hafgufa are divine sea-gods or monsters |
| **Jötun-Readers** | Desperate to study the bio-sonar communication; see it as key to understanding |
| **Midgard Combine** | Essential trade partners; control all coastal commerce |
| **Dvergr** | Grudging respect; pay exorbitant fees for safe passage |

The Fjord-Callers ignore them all. Their attention is focused on the one truth that matters: the tide, the gong, and the great, armored god that sleeps and hunts in their deep, dark waters.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the old tales, the sea was death—a vast, toxic grave ruled by great serpents. The folk of the coast learned a different truth. They watched the leviathans ignore wooden boats but savagely attack armored ships. The serpents did not hunger for flesh, but for metal. The first Fjord-Caller was a desperate fisherman who threw his salvage overboard to survive—and in doing so, struck the first bargain. Now the Fjord-Callers feed the serpents, and the serpents guard the fjords. They do not have navies; they have pet krakens. Their horns do not call to spirits—they call to the great armored gods of the deep, and the gods answer. When a Fjord-Caller sounds the Gong of the Deeps, the sea itself rises to obey. They are the ferrymen of the damned, the gatekeepers of the horizon, and without their blessing, no ship sails and no cargo moves. The people of Midgard fear the monsters. The Fjord-Callers made a deal."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Fjord-Caller (Resonance Warden) represents the Coherent Adept specialization optimized for environmental control and Psychic Stress mitigation. Mechanical role: situational controller with environment-locked abilities. Key differentiator: power scales with coastal proximity (Tier 2+ abilities require \[Coastal\] environment). Core mechanic: Resonant Horn tool-based casting using Stamina, producing \[Sonic\] effects. Signature ability: Song of the World-Serpent (once-per-combat battlefield reset that cleanses ally Psychic Stress and Stuns all enemies). Social function: gatekeeper of coastal travel—operates protection racket with Hafgufa megafauna, pilots ships through serpent territories. Trauma Economy interaction: Low-Medium risk; unique capability to reduce ally Psychic Stress via Song of Sanctuary and World-Serpent. Optimal deployment: coastal expeditions, extended operations requiring Stress management, encounters benefiting from formation disruption."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Fjord-Caller (Resonance Warden). ARCHETYPE: Adept. PATH TYPE: Coherent. ROLE: Environmental Controller / Support. PRIMARY STAT: WITS. SECONDARY STAT: WILL. RESOURCE: Stamina. CORE MECHANICS: Resonant Horn (tool requirement), Environmental Dependency (\[Coastal\] lock on T2+ abilities), Sonic damage type, Psychic Stress mitigation. TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Calls): Child of the Tides, Warning Horn, Song of Passage. T2 (Advanced Songs): Song of Sanctuary, Tidal Surge, Voice of the Deep. T3 (Mastery): Enrage Serpent, Shattering Chord. CAPSTONE: Song of the World-Serpent (once per combat, ally Stress cleanse + mental immunity 2 turns, enemy Sonic damage + Stun 1 turn). ENVIRONMENT LOCK: T2+ abilities require \[Coastal\] tag. COUNTERS: Inland environments, Push/Pull abilities moving Caller from water. SYNERGIES: Galdr-Casters (water + lightning), Controllers (formation disruption), Trauma-heavy builds (Stress mitigation)."*

## Summary

The Fjord-Caller is the **warden of an older, purer sound**.

They do not channel corrupted Aether seeking power. They do not pray to the leviathans of the deep. They made a deal—a brutal, pragmatic bargain that has made them the undisputed masters of Aethelgard's coastlines.

Their resonant horns produce vibrations that harmonize with the world's stable, foundational code, temporarily overwriting the Blight's maddening static. In coastal environments, they become unstoppable force multipliers—calling waves to reposition enemies, summoning the fury of sea serpents, and creating zones of pure resonance that shield allies from Psychic Stress.

This creates a unique niche: the **biome master** who transforms from modest support into a god-like controller based purely on positioning. A party with a Fjord-Caller will actively maneuver combat toward coastal areas, because on the coast, the Fjord-Caller is a god.

But this power comes with a price: environmental dependency.

The Fjord-Caller understands that in the Age of Echoes, power is not freely given. It is bargained for. They feed the serpents, and the serpents guard the fjords. They read the Wurm-Sign, and the tide answers. They sound the Gong of the Deeps, and the sea rises to obey.

*The people of Midgard fear the monsters.
The Fjord-Callers feed them.
This is the simple, brutal truth that separates them from the rest of humanity.*
