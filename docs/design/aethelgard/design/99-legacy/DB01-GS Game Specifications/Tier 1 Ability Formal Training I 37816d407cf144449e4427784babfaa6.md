## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Formal Training I is the Atgeir-wielder's **foundational doctrine**—the rigorous, unwavering discipline instilled through formal martial training. Unlike savage instinct or primal rage, the Atgeir-wielder's prowess comes from endless drills, practiced footwork, and intellectual understanding of combat endurance.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Permanently increase Stamina regeneration by +5 per turn
- **Secondary:** Grant +1 bonus die to resist [Staggered] status
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The disciplined warrior whose efficiency surpasses raw strength

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Moderate (sustain enhancement)
- **Always Active:** No resource cost for passive benefits
- **Sustainability Focus:** Enables continuous use of control abilities
- **Coherent Warrior:** Pure martial discipline with no Trauma Economy interaction

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Atgeir-wielder has trained for *years*. Not in the wild fury of a Berserkr or the desperate scrapping of a Strandhögg, but in the **measured discipline of a professional**. Every breath is controlled. Every movement is efficient. Every stance is perfected through ten thousand repetitions.

This training creates a warrior whose endurance is not raw toughness, but **practiced efficiency**. They expend less energy per strike, recover faster between exchanges, and maintain their footing when others would stumble.

### Thematic Resonance

Formal Training establishes the Atgeir-wielder as the thinking warrior—proof that discipline and technique can match or exceed raw power.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Stamina Regeneration Bonus

**Passive Effect:**

- +5 Stamina regenerated at the start of each combat turn
- Stacks with base regeneration and other bonuses
- Enables sustained use of control abilities

### Stagger Resistance

**Passive Effect:**

- +1 bonus die to all STURDINESS-based Resolve Checks vs [Staggered]
- Applies to any source of [Staggered] effect

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Turn Start:** Add +5 to Stamina regeneration calculation
2. **Stagger Attempt:** When [Staggered] would be applied, add +1 die to Resolve
3. **Continuous:** Both effects are always active

---

## IV. Progression Path

### Rank 1 (Base — This Ability)

- +5 Stamina regeneration per turn
- +1 die to resist [Staggered]

### Rank 2 (Expert — 20 PP)

- +8 Stamina regeneration per turn
- +1 die to resist [Staggered]
- **New:** Also gain +1 die to resist [Disoriented]

### Rank 3 (Mastery — Capstone)

- +10 Stamina regeneration per turn
- +2 dice to resist [Staggered] and [Disoriented]
- **New:** First Stamina-costing ability each combat costs 10 less Stamina
- **New:** Immune to [Staggered] while in Disciplined Stance

---

## V. Tactical Applications

1. **Sustained Control:** More Stamina = more control ability uses per combat
2. **Stability:** Resist effects that would drain Stamina or break rhythm
3. **Frontline Endurance:** Maintain active control for extended engagements
4. **Foundation:** Enables resource-intensive abilities like Line Breaker
5. **Formation Anchor:** Stay effective while allies rotate positions

---

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Disciplined Stance:** Reduced Stamina drain enables longer stance durations
- **Line Breaker (Tier 2):** High-cost ability benefits from regen boost
- **Hook and Drag (Tier 2):** Sustain multiple control attempts per combat
- **STURDINESS investment:** Stacking bonuses make Stagger near-impossible

### Negative Synergies

- **Short combats:** Less value in quick encounters
- **Resource-light builds:** Diminishing returns if not using Stamina abilities
