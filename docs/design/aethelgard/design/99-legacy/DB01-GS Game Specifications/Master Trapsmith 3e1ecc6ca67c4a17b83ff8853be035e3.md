## Thematic Description

> *"You don't just disarm traps—you improve them, repurpose them, and deploy them with lethal precision."*
> 

The Master Trapsmith has evolved beyond mere disarmament. You understand trap engineering at a fundamental level—how to enhance salvaged mechanisms, how to deploy them for maximum effect, and how to create traps that even experienced explorers cannot detect.

## Mechanical Implementation

### Passive Component

- All traps you place have **+1 turn duration** and **+1d6 damage**
- Can **carry and deploy** traps salvaged from ruins

### Active Component: Deploy Advanced Trap

- **Cost**: 35 Stamina + 2 Trap Components
- **Action**: Standard Action
- **Cooldown**: 2 turns (per trap)

**Trap Options:**

| Trap Type | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Impaling** | 4d8 Physical damage + [Bleeding] (3 turns) |
| **Entangling** | [Rooted] 3 turns + [Slowed] 2 turns after |
| **Concussive** | 3d6 damage (3×3 area) + [Stunned] (1 turn) |

### Rank 2

- **Damage Bonus**: Advanced traps gain **+2d8 damage**
- **Capacity**: Can place **2 traps per combat**
- **PP Cost**: 5

### Rank 3

- **Action Economy**: Can place traps as **Bonus Action**
- **Stealth**: Traps are **invisible** even to creatures with trap detection
- **Duration**: All effects last **+1 turn**
- **PP Cost**: 5

## Advanced Trap Details

### Impaling Trap

- **Damage**: 4d8 Physical (+2d8 at Rank 2)
- **Bleed**: [Bleeding] for 3 turns (1d6 Physical/turn)
- **Best For**: Single high-HP targets, sustained damage

### Entangling Trap

- **Control**: [Rooted] 3 turns → [Slowed] 2 turns
- **No Damage**: Pure control effect
- **Best For**: Priority target lockdown, chokepoint defense

### Concussive Trap

- **AoE**: Affects 3×3 area
- **Damage**: 3d6 (+2d8 at Rank 2)
- **Stun**: [Stunned] 1 turn (2 at Rank 3)
- **Best For**: Groups, ambush initiation

## Synergies

### Internal (Ruin-Stalker Tree)

- **Disarm Mechanism**: Salvaged components fuel trap deployment
- **Hazard Mapping**: Mark trap placement locations
- **Anomaly Sense I**: Position traps at choke points

### External (Party Composition)

- **Controllers**: Entangling traps extend control chains
- **Burst damage**: Impaling bleed + burst = high DPS
- **AoE specialists**: Concussive groups enemies for follow-up

---

## Tactical Applications

### Ambush Preparation

1. Scout enemy patrol routes
2. Place traps at chokepoints
3. Lure enemies through trapped area
4. Capitalize on control effects

### Defensive Positioning

1. Identify likely enemy approach
2. Layer Entangling + Concussive traps
3. Create kill zones for ranged allies
4. Fall back behind trap lines if pressed

### Rank 3: Bonus Action Placement

- Deploy trap + attack in same turn
- React to enemy positioning dynamically
- Combat trap placement viable
