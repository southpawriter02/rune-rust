### **Ability Overview**

**Specialization:** Jötun-Reader (System Pathologist)

**Tier:** 1 (Foundational Analysis)

**Type:** Active (Standard Action)

**Prerequisite:** Unlock the Jötun-Reader Specialization (10 PP)

**Cost:** 3 PP

### **Description**

The Jötun-Reader performs a diagnostic observation of a single foe, clinically documenting its structural flaws and failure states like a pathologist examining a cadaver. Through careful observation of movement patterns, armor construction, energy emissions, and behavioral tells, they identify critical vulnerabilities that can be exploited by their allies.

### **Mechanics**

**Action Cost:** Standard Action, 30 Stamina

**Resolution:** A **WITS**-based diagnostic check against a target.

- **Success:** Reveals one of the target's **Resistances** and one of their **Vulnerabilities** through careful observation.
- **Critical Success:** Reveals *all* Resistances and Vulnerabilities, and a hint about their behavioral patterns or AI Archetype.

**Framing:** This is **passive observation**, not active manipulation. The Jötun-Reader:

- Watches how the target moves and protects itself
- Observes which attacks it flinches from or ignores
- Notes structural weak points in armor or body
- Reads behavioral patterns and failure states
- Documents findings for tactical exploitation

**Psychic Cost:** This direct observation of corrupted processes inflicts a **small amount of Psychic Stress** on the Jötun-Reader—staring into the crash is traumatic.

### **Thematic Justification**

The Jötun-Reader does not "scan" enemies with technology or "decompile their source code." They are clinical observers who use their extensive knowledge of anatomy, engineering, and corruption patterns to identify weaknesses the same way a pathologist identifies cause of death—through systematic observation and pattern recognition.

### **Integration Notes**

- **Core Ability:** This is the Jötun-Reader's signature ability and primary combat contribution.
- **Setup Gameplay:** Designed to enable "analyze → exploit" combo patterns with Exploit Design Flaw (Tier 2).
- **Information Economy:** Provides critical tactical information that increases party effectiveness.
- **Trauma Economy:** Low-cost Stress generation creates constant mental pressure on the Jötun-Reader.
