## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Ranger |
| **Role** | Battlefield Controller / Formation Breaker / Glitch Exploiter |
| **Path Type** | Coherent |
| **Primary Attribute** | FINESSE |
| **Secondary Attribute** | MIGHT |
| **Tertiary Attribute** | WITS |
| **Resource System** | Stamina |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | Low (only Corruption Siphon Chain causes Psychic Stress) |

The **Hlekkr-master** ("Fetter-Master" or "Chain-Master") is the Ranger specialization that exploits the unstable physics of a glitching reality.

They are masters of chains, hooks, and nets, but their true expertise lies in their uncanny timing. They see the battlefield as a **flawed machine** full of jerky movements and desynchronized actions, and they use their tools to snag, pull, and manipulate these glitches to their advantage.

In a world where the Runic Blight makes physics unstable and creatures prone to stuttering like corrupted software, the Hlekkr-master is a grimly pragmatic combatant. They've learned that the more corrupted a foe, the less coherent its connection to physical space. Their chains don't just bind—they **exploit system errors**, yanking glitching enemies through space, locking malfunctioning servos, and triggering cascade failures.

To choose the Hlekkr-master is to embrace the fantasy of the brutal tactician who turns chaos into control. Your saga is written in the snap of chains and the screams of enemies dragged into kill zones. You are not a hero—you are a controller who makes the system's errors work for you.

## Core Philosophy: Exploiting the Lag

### The Pragmatist of a Broken World

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Corruption = Vulnerability** | The more glitched they are, the easier they are to manipulate |
| **Position is Power** | Control where enemies stand, control the fight |
| **Pragmatic Domination** | A trapped enemy is a dead enemy |

In a reality where the Runic Blight has made the world's physics unstable and its inhabitants prone to "glitching," the Hlekkr-master has learned to **exploit the lag**. They are not heroes; they are controllers who turn their enemy's corrupted nature against them through superior leverage and a cruel, tactical acumen.

> *"Most fighters see a Forlorn and think 'threat.' I see a Forlorn and think 'opportunity.' Its connection to physical reality is fraying. Its movements are jerky, desynchronized. When I throw my hook, I'm not aiming at where it is—I'm aiming at where it will be when its glitching body catches up with itself. And when I pull, it slides through space like a bad packet across a corrupted network. The Blight makes them sick. I make them useful."*

Their saga is a brutal story of using the system's errors to create their own perfect, deadly opportunities.

### The Coherent Controller

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Source** | Physical tools; timing; tactical acumen |
| **Method** | Ensnare → Reposition → Exploit → Punish |
| **Cost** | Low (only Corruption Siphon Chain causes Stress) |
| **Philosophy** | Turn the enemy's corruption against them |

The Hlekkr-master is a **coherent** specialization. All abilities are physical and skill-based—they exploit the Blight but don't channel it. This makes them one of the safest controller options for parties concerned about Trauma Economy accumulation.

> *"The Rust-Witch channels entropy. The Blight-Weaver communes with chaos. I do neither. My chains are iron. My hooks are steel. My nets are weighted rope. I don't bargain with the Blight for power—I simply observe that corrupted things move badly, and I exploit that fact with physics. The Blight is a disease. I am a predator that hunts the sick."*

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Brutal tactician; battlefield puppeteer; the one who dictates positioning |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Ensnare → Reposition → Exploit → Punish |
| **Success Metric** | Enemies controlled; formations broken; allies set up for kills |
| **Decision Space** | Where to drag enemies; which targets to lock down; when to chain-pull |

Playing a Hlekkr-master is about **tactical manipulation**.

Your gameplay loop is:
1. **Ensnare**: Apply control effects (\[Rooted\], \[Slowed\]) to lock enemies down
2. **Reposition**: Use Pull/Push to drag enemies into hazards or away from allies
3. **Exploit**: Target highly corrupted enemies for increased effect
4. **Punish**: Deal bonus damage to controlled/helpless targets

> *"One turn, I throw my net and root the Forlorn in place. The next, I hook the back-row caster and drag it into melee range where our Berserkr is waiting. The turn after that, I lock down the mechanical guardian with Unyielding Grip while our Galdr-caster completes their chant. I don't deal damage—I create opportunities for everyone else to deal damage."*

You are the party's **tactical manipulator**—the specialist who breaks enemy formations, drags priority targets into kill zones, locks down dangerous foes, and creates opportunities for your allies.

### The Trade-Off

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Control value: 10/10 (best in game) | Personal damage: 3/10 (worst among Rangers) |
| Party damage amplification: 9/10 | Requires allies to capitalize on control |
| Formation disruption: extreme | Vulnerable if enemies close distance |

The Hlekkr-master has **very low personal damage output**. Your value is in control and positioning, not kills. You need allies to capitalize on the opportunities you create.

> *"I am not the executioner. I am the one who holds the condemned in place while the executioner swings. My chains don't kill—they ensure that someone else's blade does."*

## Core Mechanics: The Three Pillars

### Pillar 1: Formation Breaking (Forced Movement)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Physically move enemies with Pull/Push effects |
| **Effect** | Break formations; drag targets into kill zones |
| **Unique Feature** | Only specialization with comprehensive forced movement toolkit |
| **Scaling** | Effectiveness increases against corrupted enemies |

**Forced Movement** is the signature mechanic. A "Grappling Hook Toss" allows the Hlekkr-master to physically **Pull** a vulnerable, glitching enemy out of position. They can use their tools to forcibly move enemies, breaking formations and dragging high-priority targets into kill zones.

> *"The ranged enemy thinks it's safe in the back row. My hook disagrees. One throw, one pull, and suddenly it's standing in front of our Hólmgangr. The formation that protected it is broken. The distance that kept it safe is gone. Position is power—and I control position."*

| Tool | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Grappling Hook Toss** | Pull single target from back row to front |
| **Sweeping Fetter** | AoE control across an entire row |
| **Chain Scythe** | Damage + Pull multiple enemies simultaneously |

### Pillar 2: System Snagging (Exploiting Corruption)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Increased effectiveness against corrupted enemies |
| **Effect** | Higher success rates; easier pulls; better locks |
| **Unique Feature** | Only controller whose effectiveness scales with enemy corruption |
| **Philosophy** | The more glitched they are, the easier they are to manipulate |

This is the Hlekkr-master's **defining pillar**. They have learned that the more corrupted a foe is, the less coherent its connection to the physical world. Their abilities are uniquely effective against foes with high Runic Blight Corruption. A \[Blighted\] creature's erratic movements make it an easier target for their nets and hooks.

> *"A coherent enemy resists my pull. They have a firm grip on physical reality. But a corrupted enemy? Their connection to space is already fraying. When I throw my hook, it catches on their glitching form more easily. When I pull, they slide through reality like bad data across a corrupted network. Most specialists struggle with corrupted enemies. I thrive against them."*

| Corruption Level | Effect |
|------------------|--------|
| **Low Corruption** | Standard difficulty |
| **Medium Corruption** | Increased success rate on control effects |
| **High Corruption** | Significantly increased success; enemies are "puppets" |

### Pillar 3: Positional Exploitation (Pragmatic Domination)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Bonus effects against controlled/helpless enemies |
| **Effect** | Damage bonuses; guaranteed hits; cascade failures |
| **Synergy** | Creates feedback loop: control → exploit → more control |

The Hlekkr-master has a simple philosophy: **a trapped enemy is a dead enemy**. They have a predator's instinct for capitalizing on a foe's immobility or confusion. Their passive abilities grant them bonuses for attacking enemies that have been repositioned, snared, or are suffering from Blight-induced glitches.

> *"When I hit a rooted enemy, I hit harder. When I strike a stunned enemy, I never miss. When I attack a seized machine, I trigger cascade failures. Every control effect I apply creates an exploitation window. And I have been trained to exploit every window I create."*

## Abilities: The Fetter's Arsenal

### Tier 1 — Foundational Control

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Pragmatic Preparation I** | Passive | — | Bonus to initiative; extra tool charges; always have what you need |
| **Grappling Hook Toss** | Active | 30 Stamina | Pull single target from back row to front; bonus success vs corrupted |
| **Netting Shot** | Active | 25 Stamina | Apply \[Slowed\] for 2 turns; bonus duration vs corrupted enemies |

**Pragmatic Preparation I** is the foundation—the grim, professional mindset of a true controller.

| Bonus | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Initiative | Bonus die to act before enemies can position |
| Tool Charges | Extra uses of chains, hooks, and nets per expedition |
| Passive | Always active; represents meticulous preparation |

> *"In a world of glitches and unpredictable, chaotic foes, the Hlekkr-master trusts in the reliable weight of iron chains and the undeniable physics of a well-thrown hook. Before every expedition, they check their tools twice. In the field, they are never caught without the right fetter for the job."*

**Grappling Hook Toss** is the signature ability—battlefield manipulation through brute physics.

| Rank | Pull Distance | Damage | Special |
|------|---------------|--------|---------|
| Rank 1 | 1 row | Low Physical | Base pull effect |
| Rank 2 | 2 rows | Moderate Physical | Bonus accuracy vs \[Blighted\] |
| Rank 3 | 3 rows | Moderate Physical | Can drag through hazards for bonus damage |

> *"The Hlekkr-master hurls a heavy, barbed hook at a distant enemy. When it connects, they brace and pull. The enemy is wrenched from its position and dragged into melee range. Against corrupted enemies, the hook seems to catch more easily—their unstable forms offer less resistance to being yanked through space."*

**Netting Shot** is the foundational control ability—simple physics applied to glitching targets.

| Rank | Duration | Effect | Special |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| Rank 1 | 2 turns | \[Slowed\] | Base control |
| Rank 2 | 3 turns | \[Slowed\] | Bonus duration vs corrupted |
| Rank 3 | 3 turns | \[Slowed\] + \[Rooted\] on crit | Can anticipate glitch patterns |

> *"The weighted net spreads in the air, descending on the target like a physical assertion of stillness. Against glitching enemies, the Hlekkr-master has learned to throw where they will be a half-second before they arrive. The result: the enemy materializes directly into the trap."*

### Tier 2 — Advanced Tactics

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Snag the Glitch** | Passive | — | All control abilities have increased success vs high-Corruption enemies |
| **Unyielding Grip** | Active | 45 Stamina | Apply \[Seized\] to Undying/mechanical enemies for 1 turn |
| **Punish the Helpless** | Passive | — | Bonus damage to \[Rooted\], \[Stunned\], \[Seized\], or \[Disoriented\] enemies |

**Snag the Glitch** is the core of the Hlekkr-master's philosophy—exploit the compromised.

| Trigger | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Target has moderate Corruption | +1d10 to control ability success |
| Target has high Corruption | +2d10 to control ability success |
| Target is \[Blighted\] | Control effects auto-succeed on natural 7+ |

> *"The Hlekkr-master develops an intuitive sense for the Blight's rhythm. They can anticipate the momentary flickers and stutters of a corrupted foe, making their ensnaring tools preternaturally accurate against such targets. Where others see horror in the Blight's effects, the Hlekkr-master sees opportunity."*

**Unyielding Grip** is the anti-machine disabling tool—a brutal, physical system interrupt.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cost | 45 Stamina |
| Effect | \[Seized\] for 1 turn (prevents all actions) |
| Targets | Undying and mechanical enemies |
| Special | Aims at sparking servos and malfunctioning joints |

> *"The Hlekkr-master's hook is aimed not at flesh, but at a sparking, malfunctioning servo. When it connects, they lock it in place, forcing a critical system error. The machine stutters, freezes, and for one precious turn, does nothing. Against the Undying, the grip catches on their paradoxical joints, locking their corrupted forms in place."*

**Punish the Helpless** is the damage amplification passive—the predator's instinct.

| Rank | Bonus Damage | Effect |
|------|--------------|--------|
| Rank 2 | +1d10 Physical | Attacks vs controlled enemies hit harder |
| Rank 3 | +3d10 Physical | Advantage on attacks; DoT on hit |

> *"The Hlekkr-master has a simple philosophy: a trapped enemy is a dead enemy. They have a predator's instinct for capitalizing on a foe's immobility or confusion. When they strike a helpless target, they exploit the restricted movements to hit weak points with brutal, focused damage."*

### Tier 3 — Mastery of the Leash

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Chain Scythe** | Active | 50 Stamina | AoE damage + Pull to all enemies in row; bonus vs corrupted |
| **Corruption Siphon Chain** | Active | 40 Stamina + 5 Psychic Stress | Drain Corruption from enemy; apply \[Vulnerable\] |

**Chain Scythe** is the crowd control tool—damage plus forced repositioning across an entire formation.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cost | 50 Stamina |
| Damage | Moderate Physical to all enemies in target row |
| Effect | Pull all damaged enemies toward Hlekkr-master |
| Special | Against corrupted enemies, blade catches more easily; pulls succeed more often |

> *"The weapon is deceptively simple—a heavy scythe blade forged from dark iron, connected to a reinforced chain that wraps around the Hlekkr-master's forearm. When swung, the chain extends to its full length, and the blade arcs through the air in a wide, sweeping curve. Anyone caught in its path is cut, and the momentum of the spinning blade carries it onward to the next target. As the chain retracts, each enemy hit can be pulled toward the Hlekkr-master. The result: damage plus forced repositioning across an entire enemy formation."*

**Corruption Siphon Chain** is the risky utility—the one ability that touches the Trauma Economy.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cost | 40 Stamina + 5 Psychic Stress |
| Effect | Drain Corruption from enemy; apply \[Vulnerable\] for 2 turns |
| Risk | Only Hlekkr-master ability that causes Psychic Stress |
| Reward | \[Vulnerable\] increases all damage to target by 50% |

> *"The Hlekkr-master extends their chain and channels a dangerous technique—one that brushes against the corruption they usually only exploit from a distance. The chain wraps around a corrupted enemy and drains a portion of their Blight, applying the \[Vulnerable\] condition. The enemy becomes a glass cannon, taking 50% more damage from all sources. But the Hlekkr-master absorbs psychic backlash—a reminder that even exploiting the Blight has costs."*

### Capstone — Master of Puppets

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Passive: Cascade Vulnerability** | All enemies you Pull gain \[Vulnerable\] automatically |
| **Active: Puppet Master** | Once per combat, seize complete control over one enemy's movement for 2 turns |
| **Cost** | 60 Stamina (active component) |

The capstone **Master of Puppets** is the moment the Hlekkr-master transcends from controller to **battlefield puppeteer**.

**Passive Component: Cascade Vulnerability**

| Trigger | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Pull any enemy | Target gains \[Vulnerable\] for 1 turn |
| Implication | Every Pull becomes a 50% damage amplification window |

> *"This transforms every Pull from a simple repositioning tool into a damage amplification window. Pull an enemy into melee range, and your party's melee fighters hit 50% harder. Pull an enemy into a caster's prepared spell, and the spell deals 50% more damage. Pull an enemy through a hazard, and the hazard damage is amplified. The Hlekkr-master becomes the setup artist for the entire party's burst damage."*

**Active Component: Puppet Master**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cost | 60 Stamina |
| Limit | Once per combat |
| Duration | 2 turns |
| Effect | Complete control over one enemy's movement (not actions) |
| Special | Can force enemy to walk into hazards, ally attacks, or off cliffs |

> *"The Hlekkr-master wraps their chains around a single enemy and seizes complete control. For two turns, they dictate where that enemy goes. They can force it to walk into hazards, position it for ally attacks, or simply hold it in place while the party focuses on other threats. The enemy still acts on its turn—but it goes where the Hlekkr-master commands."*

## Systemic Integration

### The Coherent Controller

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Primary Function** | Battlefield control; forced movement; formation breaking |
| **Power Source** | Physical tools; timing; tactical acumen |
| **Unique Contribution** | Only specialization with comprehensive Pull/Push toolkit |

The Hlekkr-master is a **coherent** Ranger specialization. All abilities are physical and skill-based—they exploit the Blight but don't channel it.

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Coherent (Low Trauma risk) |
| **Corruption Sources** | None |
| **Psychic Stress Sources** | Only Corruption Siphon Chain (+5 Stress per use) |
| **Player Experience** | Safe controller option; exploit without corruption |

The Hlekkr-master proves that **coherent control can match heretical power**:
- No self-inflicted Corruption
- Only one ability causes Psychic Stress (and it's optional)
- Effectiveness scales with enemy corruption (you exploit, not channel)
- Safe path for parties avoiding Trauma Economy spirals

> *"The Rust-Witch trades soul for power. The Echo-Caller screams themselves into madness. I trade nothing. My chains are iron. My hooks are steel. The only Stress I take is when I choose to use the Siphon Chain—and that's a calculated risk, not a spiral. I am living proof that you can control the corrupted without becoming corrupted yourself."*

### Corruption Mechanics Integration

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Unique Niche** | Corruption makes enemies easier to control, not harder |
| **Tactical Implication** | Parties specifically want Hlekkr-master against high-corruption encounters |
| **Philosophy** | "The more glitched, stuttering, and unstable they are, the easier they are to yank around" |

Most specialists struggle with corrupted enemies. The Hlekkr-master **thrives** against them.

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Melee Strikers** | You pull vulnerable targets into their range; Cascade Vulnerability amplifies their damage |
| **Environmental Hazard Users** | You force enemies into their traps/zones |
| **Glass Cannons** | You lock down threats while they cast; your control buys them time |
| **Hólmgangr** | You \[Root\] secondary enemies while they duel their \[Challenged\] target |
| **Berserkr** | You pull scattered enemies into their cleave range |

**Negative Synergies:**

| Ally | Issue |
|------|-------|
| **Other Controllers** | Redundant control; one is usually enough |
| **Ranged-Only Parties** | Your pulls bring enemies closer to everyone |

> *"The Galdr-caster needs three turns to complete their spell. I lock down the melee threats with Netting Shot. I drag the back-row caster into our front line with Grappling Hook. I seize the mechanical guardian with Unyielding Grip. By the time the Galdr-caster's chant completes, every enemy is exactly where we need them to be—and they're all \[Vulnerable\] from my pulls. The spell lands. The encounter ends. I dealt maybe 50 total damage. I enabled 500."*

### Positional Considerations

| Position | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Back Row** | Optimal; safe for chain throwing; maintains distance |
| **Mid Row** | Acceptable; can pull from either direction |
| **Front Row** | Suboptimal; better for melee specialists |

---

## Lore Integration

### The Fetter's Calling

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Philosophy** | Pragmatic domination; exploit weakness; control through leverage |
| **Training** | Years studying Blight patterns; timing glitch cycles; perfecting throws |
| **Function** | Turn the enemy's corruption against them |
| **Status** | Respected as tacticians; feared as captors |

The Hlekkr-master represents the philosophy that **the world's sickness can be exploited**. In a reality where corrupted creatures stutter and glitch like broken software, the Hlekkr-master has learned to read those glitches and exploit them with brutal precision.

> *"The old warriors tried to fight the Blighted with strength. They were overwhelmed by numbers. The mystics tried to cure them with magic. They were corrupted themselves. The Hlekkr-masters took a different path: we do not fight the Blight, we do not cure it. We use it. Every glitch is a vulnerability. Every stutter is an opening. We turn the enemy's sickness into their chains."*

### The Tools of Control

| Tool | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Grappling Hook** | Heavy barbed iron; pulls enemies through space |
| **Weighted Net** | Rope and lead; applies \[Slowed\] and \[Rooted\] |
| **Chain Scythe** | Dark iron blade on reinforced chain; AoE damage + pull |
| **Binding Chains** | Pure iron links; the universal fetter |

The Hlekkr-master's power is not magic—it is **physics and timing**. Their tools are iron, steel, and rope. Their expertise is knowing when a glitching enemy will be vulnerable and where to place the chain.

> *"My chains are not enchanted. My hooks are not runed. My nets are weighted rope, nothing more. The magic is in the timing. The power is in knowing that a corrupted enemy will flicker left in three seconds, and throwing my hook to where they will be when they flicker. I don't need magic. I need physics and patience."*

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Iron-Banes** | Respected colleagues; both exploit corrupted enemies |
| **Jötun-Readers** | Valued support; Readers identify, Hlekkr-masters control |
| **Grove-Clans** | Cautious respect; pragmatic methods, but effective |
| **Rust-Witches** | Professional distance; "they channel, we exploit" |
| **General Population** | Feared; "the ones with chains who drag you where they want" |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the Age of Echoes, when reality itself stutters and glitches like corrupted code, the Hlekkr-master has learned to read the lag. They are not heroes who stand against the Blight with sword and courage—they are predators who have learned that the Blight makes prey easier to catch. Their chains are iron. Their hooks are steel. Their nets are weighted rope. But their true weapon is timing—the uncanny ability to know when a glitching enemy will flicker, where their unstable form will materialize, and how to place a fetter in that exact spot. They are the battlefield puppeteers, the ones who dictate where enemies stand and where enemies fall. Their saga is written not in kills, but in control—in formations broken, priority targets dragged into kill zones, and deadly threats locked in place while allies deliver the finishing blow. They are the grimly pragmatic proof that you don't need to channel the Blight to defeat it. You just need to understand that corrupted things move badly. And that badly-moving things are easy to catch."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Hlekkr-master (Chain-Master/Fetter-Master) represents the Ranger specialization optimized for battlefield control through forced movement and corruption exploitation. Mechanical role: tactical controller and formation breaker. Core mechanics: Forced Movement (Pull/Push with Grappling Hook Toss, Chain Scythe), System Snagging (increased effectiveness vs corrupted enemies via Snag the Glitch), and Positional Exploitation (bonus damage to controlled enemies via Punish the Helpless). Key differentiator: only specialization with comprehensive Pull/Push toolkit; only controller whose effectiveness scales with enemy corruption level. Signature ability: Master of Puppets (Cascade Vulnerability makes all pulls apply \[Vulnerable\]; Puppet Master grants complete movement control over one enemy). Trauma Economy integration: Low risk; coherent path with no Corruption; only Corruption Siphon Chain causes Psychic Stress (+5 per use). Social function: pragmatic tactician who exploits the Blight without channeling it. Optimal deployment: high-corruption encounters; parties with strong damage dealers who need setup; formation-based enemy groups."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Hlekkr-master (Chain-Master/Glitch Exploiter). ARCHETYPE: Ranger. PATH TYPE: Coherent. ROLE: Battlefield Controller / Formation Breaker / Glitch Exploiter. PRIMARY STAT: FINESSE. SECONDARY STAT: MIGHT. TERTIARY STAT: WITS. RESOURCE: Stamina. CORE MECHANICS: Forced Movement (Pull/Push), System Snagging (bonus vs corrupted), Positional Exploitation (bonus vs controlled). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Control): Pragmatic Preparation I (passive), Grappling Hook Toss (30 Stamina, single Pull), Netting Shot (25 Stamina, \[Slowed\]). T2 (Advanced Tactics): Snag the Glitch (passive, +success vs corrupted), Unyielding Grip (45 Stamina, \[Seized\] to Undying/mechanical), Punish the Helpless (passive, +damage vs controlled). T3 (Mastery): Chain Scythe (50 Stamina, AoE damage + Pull), Corruption Siphon Chain (40 Stamina + 5 Stress, drain Corruption + \[Vulnerable\]). CAPSTONE: Master of Puppets (Passive: all Pulls apply \[Vulnerable\]; Active: 60 Stamina, control one enemy's movement for 2 turns, once per combat). TRAUMA ECONOMY: Low risk; coherent path; no Corruption; only Corruption Siphon Chain causes Stress (+5 per use)."*

## Summary

The Hlekkr-master is the **glitch exploiter**.

They are tactical controllers who have learned that corrupted things move badly—and that badly-moving things are easy to catch. Their chains, hooks, and nets are not magical tools but physical implements wielded with perfect timing against glitching enemies whose connection to physical reality is already fraying.

Their gameplay is a strategic dance of ensnaring, repositioning, and capitalizing on the chaos created by the Blight. They have very low personal damage output, but their ability to completely control enemy positioning, drag priority targets into kill zones, and amplify ally damage through \[Vulnerable\] makes them one of the most valuable support specialists in the game.

This creates a unique niche: the **coherent battlefield controller** who exploits corruption without channeling it. Where others struggle against highly corrupted enemies, the Hlekkr-master thrives—the more glitched the target, the easier it is to yank around like a puppet.

The capstone Master of Puppets represents the ultimate expression of this philosophy—the moment when the Hlekkr-master transcends from controller to battlefield puppeteer, transforming every Pull into a damage amplification window and seizing complete control over one enemy's very movement.

This is not magic. This is physics and timing.
The Blight makes them sick.
I make them useful.

*A trapped enemy is a dead enemy.
The more corrupted they are, the easier they are to yank around.
Control where they stand, control the fight.*
