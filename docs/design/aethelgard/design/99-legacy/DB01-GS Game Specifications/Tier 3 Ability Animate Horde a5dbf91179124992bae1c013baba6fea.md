## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Animate Horde is the God-Sleeper Cultist's **mass summoning ability**—the evolution of their minion-master identity from single construct to overwhelming swarm. This delivers the fantasy of the heretical commander leading an army of glitching metal.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Summon multiple weaker minions simultaneously
- **Secondary:** Establish action economy dominance through numbers
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The verse that awakens an army of dead metal

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High (3 minions = 3 additional actions)
- **Environmental Requirement:** Requires 2+ [Scrap Piles]
- **Weaker Individual Units:** Swarmlings are weaker than Constructs
- **AP Cost:** Significant investment, but efficient per minion

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Cultist raises their voice in a powerful verse—not a whispered prayer, but a *command* that echoes through the battlefield. Every pile of scrap, every piece of debris, every shard of rusted metal hears the call and *answers*.

The scrap doesn't assemble into single, humanoid forms. Instead, smaller shapes rise—crawling, skittering, glitching things that move with the erratic energy of corrupted code. They are not soldiers; they are a *swarm*, a tide of animated debris that floods toward the enemy.

### Thematic Resonance

Animate Horde is the Cultist's moment of true power—when their faith transcends individual creation and becomes mass animation. The battlefield becomes their congregation, and every piece of dead metal answers their sermon.
