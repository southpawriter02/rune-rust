## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Keeper of Sagas I establishes the Thul's identity as the **master of oral histories and fatal flaws**. This foundational passive ensures their Rhetoric and investigative abilities are always superior, reinforcing their role as the party's analytical mind.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** +1 bonus die to all Rhetoric skill checks
- **Secondary:** +1 bonus die to investigate checks for creature lore/weaknesses
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The walking library of histories, laws, and recorded failures

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Moderate for Tier 1 passive (dual-skill bonus)
- **Skill Dependency:** Value scales with frequency of Rhetoric/investigate use
- **Foundation:** Sets up all other Thul abilities which rely on Rhetoric

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Thul's mind is a **vast archive**—not of inspirational tales, but of cautionary ones. They remember every recorded failure, every broken oath, every tactical blunder in the histories. They know the laws that were broken, the promises that were betrayed, the flaws that doomed heroes and villains alike.

When they study an enemy, they are not looking for glory; they are searching for the cracks in their saga.

### Thematic Resonance

In Aethelgard, knowledge of the past is power. The Thul weaponizes history itself, turning the recorded failures of others into ammunition for psychological warfare.

---

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **All Thul abilities:** Every Rhetoric-based ability benefits from bonus die
- **Jötun-Reader:** Combined investigation creates comprehensive enemy profiles
- **High-WITS builds:** Bonus die multiplies value of WITS investment
- **Social-focused campaigns:** Rhetoric bonuses valuable outside combat

### Negative Synergies

- **Combat-only parties:** Investigation bonuses may be underutilized
- **Non-intelligent enemies:** Rhetoric debuffs don't work; passive less valuable
