# Armor Voice Guidance

## Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Common Lore

> "In the time of the ancestors, warriors wore armor of light and thought—shells that moved with them, healed them, protected them from every danger. The god-armor could not be pierced by blade or bolt. It kept them warm in the frozen wastes and cool in the burning deeps. It loved them and cared for them and would never let them come to harm.
>
> Then the world broke, and the love of the god-armor became hunger.
>
> Now the shells of light strangle those who wear them. The healing-armor cuts and burns trying to cure wounds that do not exist. The thought-armor thinks wrong thoughts—sees enemies everywhere, sees threats in every heartbeat, sees danger in the very blood of those it was made to protect.
>
> So we wear dead shells. Leather that was never alive. Steel that cannot think. Plate that sits heavy and stupid on our shoulders, doing exactly what dead things do—nothing at all, until something hits it.
>
> The god-armor loved the ancestors to death. Our armor doesn't love us.
>
> And that's why we're still alive to wear it."

*   **Permitted vocabulary:** god-armor, shells of light, the ancestors, the breaking, dead shells, steel and leather, the Dvergr way
*   **Prohibited vocabulary:** Pre-Glitch, Aetheric contamination, biometric malfunction, medical subroutine failure, Pure Principles

## Layer 2 (Diagnostic) — Jötun-Reader Analysis

> "PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT ASSESSMENT — POST-GLITCH STANDARDIZATION
>
> The fundamental shift from Aesir-era protective systems to contemporary armor represents deliberate technological regression in response to catastrophic integrated-system failure. Pre-Glitch armor incorporated medical subroutines, environmental control, biometric monitoring, and adaptive threat response—all systems vulnerable to Blight corruption following Yggdrasil Network severance.
>
> Documented malfunction patterns in pre-Glitch armor: biometric misidentification (wearer flagged as deceased/injured/hostile), medical protocol inversion (healing procedures applied to healthy tissue), environmental system failure (temperature regulation cycles to lethal extremes), adaptive response corruption (armor itself identified as threat requiring neutralization). Combined critical failure probability: 67% within 5 minutes of activation.
>
> Contemporary armor systems (Pure Principles manufacture): zero integrated electronics; no medical capability; no environmental control; no adaptive response. Protection limited to passive physics—material density, structural integrity, impact distribution. Failure modes limited to physical degradation (material fatigue, structural compromise, coverage gaps)—predictable, preventable, survivable.
>
> Recommended field protocol: pre-Glitch armor classified as hazardous artifacts; activation prohibited without containment protocols; passive armor preferred for all field applications."

*   **Permitted vocabulary:** Aetheric contamination, malfunction probability, Pure Principles, biometric failure, medical protocol inversion, network severance, passive protection
*   **Prohibited vocabulary:** Mythic epithets, god-armor, ancestor-curses, poetic framing

## Layer 3 (Technical) — Pre-Glitch Reference

> "AESIR ENGINEERING DIVISION — PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT SPECIFICATION
>
> STANDARD ISSUE: Freya-Pattern Tactical Armor (light combat); Tyr-Pattern Assault Plate (heavy combat); Baldr-Pattern Ceremonial Armor (social/formal)
>
> POWER SOURCE: Miniaturized Aetheric cells; 48-hour operational capacity; network-assisted recharge via Yggdrasil Grid integration
>
> MEDICAL SYSTEMS: Continuous biometric monitoring; automated trauma response; auto-injection capability (stimulants, coagulants, analgesics); wound sealing via localized energy application
>
> ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL: Full climate regulation (-40°C to +60°C operational range); atmospheric filtering (biological/chemical/radiological); pressure compensation (0.1 to 3.0 ATM operational range)
>
> ADAPTIVE DEFENSE: Real-time threat analysis; predictive hardening (pre-impact stiffening); kinetic distribution (force spreading across surface area)
>
> POST-GLITCH STATUS: All systems compromised. Network severance disabled coordination protocols. Aetheric contamination destabilized medical systems. Biometric corruption produced false health readings. Adaptive systems misidentified wearers as threats. CLASSIFICATION: HAZARDOUS. ACTIVATION PROHIBITED."
