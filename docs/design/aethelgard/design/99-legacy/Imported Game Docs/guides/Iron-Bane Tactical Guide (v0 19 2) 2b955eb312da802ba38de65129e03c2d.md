# Iron-Bane Tactical Guide (v0.19.2)

## Overview

**Iron-Bane** is a Coherent Warrior specialization that excels at destroying Mechanical and Undying enemies through knowledge, precision, and holy fire. Where other Warriors rely on brute force, the Iron-Bane fights with understanding—identifying weaknesses, exploiting vulnerabilities, and purging corruption with righteous flame.

**Core Identity:**

- **Archetype:** Warrior
- **Path:** Coherent (Low Trauma Risk)
- **Primary Attribute:** WILL (not MIGHT!)
- **Secondary Attribute:** MIGHT
- **Resource:** Stamina + Righteous Fervor
- **Unlock Requirements:** Legend 3, WILL 3
- **Icon:** 🔥

## When to Pick Iron-Bane

### ✅ EXCELLENT Choice For:

- **Undying-heavy dungeons** - Dominates against corrupted machines
- **Mechanical boss fights** - 2-3x damage against these enemy types
- **Party needs anti-armor specialist** - Bypasses defenses with knowledge
- **Players who prefer tactical, knowledge-based combat** - Study enemies, identify weaknesses
- **Coherent path players** - No Stress penalty, safe resource management

### ❌ POOR Choice For:

- **Organic-heavy encounters** - Average to below-average against beasts/humanoids
- **MIGHT-focused builds** - Requires WILL investment for effectiveness
- **Players who want general-purpose damage** - Very situational specialist

### ⚠️ SITUATIONAL:

- **Mixed encounters** - Shines against mechanicals, average against others
- **Unknown dungeon types** - Risk of low value if no Mechanical/Undying present

## Resource Management

### Righteous Fervor (0-100)

Unlike Savagery (the heretical Skar-Horde resource), **Righteous Fervor is safe and coherent**:

- ✅ **No Stress penalty** when generating or spending
- ✅ **Generated by damaging Mechanical/Undying enemies**
- ✅ **Boosted by Righteous Conviction passive** (+50%/+75%/+100%)
- ✅ **Required for powerful abilities** (System Shutdown, Critical Strike, Divine Purge)

**Generation Strategy:**

1. **Early Combat:** Use Purifying Flame (costs Stamina, generates 15-25 Fervor)
2. **Mid Combat:** Spend on System Shutdown (30 Fervor) or Critical Strike (25 Fervor)
3. **Late Combat:** Save 75 Fervor for Divine Purge (boss deletion)

**Fervor Efficiency:**

- Scholar of Corruption Rank 2: Auto-observe grants 10 Fervor at combat start
- Righteous Conviction Rank 3: **Double all Fervor generation**
- Flame Ward Rank 3: Generate 10 Fervor when hit by Mechanical/Undying

## Combat Strategy

### Opening (Turns 1-2)

1. **Scholar of Corruption auto-triggers** (if Rank 2+) → 10 Fervor + all enemy intel
2. **Purifying Flame** x1-2 to stack Fervor (25-50 total)
3. Identify priority target (highest threat Mechanical/Undying)

### Mid-Fight (Turns 3-4)

1. **System Shutdown priority target** (if threatened) OR
2. **Critical Strike boss** (if HP <40% and Rank 3) OR
3. **Continue Fervor stacking** if target is healthy

### Execute Phase (Turn 5+)

1. Wait for 75 Fervor accumulation
2. **Purging Flame** to soften front row (if multiple enemies)
3. **Divine Purge** on boss/tankiest enemy
4. Rank 2/3: Explosion should clear remaining adds

### Emergency Tactics

- **Low on Fervor?** Spam Purifying Flame (WILL-based, safe)
- **Being overwhelmed?** System Shutdown the biggest threat
- **Boss <40% HP?** Critical Strike for instant execute
- **Out of Stamina?** Defend and regen (Fervor persists through turns)

## Attribute Priority

### Essential

- **WILL (Primary):** All abilities scale with WILL. Aim for 5+ by Level 5.
- **STURDINESS:** HP pool for survivability

### Recommended

- **MIGHT (Secondary):** Melee accuracy and backup damage
- **WITS:** Initiative to purge threats before they act

### Optional

- **FINESSE:** Generally not needed (you use WILL for attacks)

## Equipment Synergies

### Weapons

- **Fire-enchanted melee weapons** → Stack with Purifying Flame
- **WILL-scaling weapons** → Rare but optimal
- **High-accuracy weapons** → Compensate for WILL-based to-hit

### Armor

- **Fire-resistant armor** → Stack with Flame Ward (approach immunity)
- **WILL-boosting robes** → Maximize damage and save DCs
- **HP-boosting plate** → Survive while setting up combos

### Accessories

- **Fervor generation trinkets** (if available)
- **WILL +1/+2 amulets**
- **Anti-Corruption items** → Coherent path synergy

## Multiclass Synergies

### Adept (WILL-based)

- ✅ **EXCELLENT:** Both use WILL, stack attribute investment
- ✅ Scholar archetype thematic fit (knowledge + magic)
- ✅ Healing + purification = ultimate anti-Undying

### Skald (Social/Support)

- ⚠️ **MIXED:** Can buff party, but attributes don't synergize
- ⚠️ Iron-Bane wants WILL; Skald wants WITS/FINESSE

### Jotun-Marked (Heretical)

- ❌ **ANTI-SYNERGY:** Coherent vs Heretical path conflict
- ❌ Thematically opposed (holy fire vs corruption)

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Don't

1. **Pick Iron-Bane for organic-heavy campaigns** → 70% damage vs normal Warriors
2. **Invest in MIGHT instead of WILL** → All abilities scale with WILL
3. **Waste Fervor on weak enemies** → Save for bosses/elites
4. **Use Divine Purge before 75 Fervor** → You can't, it won't let you
5. **Skip Scholar of Corruption** → Free info = free wins

### ✅ Do

1. **Max Scholar first** → Information advantage is everything
2. **Stack Righteous Conviction early** → Double Fervor generation
3. **Combine Purging Flame + Divine Purge** → Vulnerable setup
4. **Use Critical Strike on <40% HP enemies** → Free instant kills
5. **Lean into specialization** → Accept weakness vs organics

## Lore & Roleplay

You are not a warrior. You are a **scholar-slayer**, a **warrior-priest** of forgotten knowledge. You have studied pre-Glitch schematics, memorized Undying anatomy, and learned that understanding is the deadliest weapon.

**Character Themes:**

- "I don't fight machines. I debug them."
- "Every weakness memorized. Every failure cataloged."
- "Holy fire cleanses corrupted iron."
- "Knowledge is the deadliest weapon."

**Roleplaying Hooks:**

- Study enemies before engaging (Scholar fantasy)
- Quote technical manuals during combat
- Treat fights as applied debugging
- Show pity for Undying (they're broken, not evil)
- Disdain for brute-force Warriors (you fight *smarter*)
