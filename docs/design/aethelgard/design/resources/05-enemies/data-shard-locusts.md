# Data-Shard Locusts (Crystallis-Locusta Pattern) — Corrupted Vanir Information Management Organism Specification
## Codex Entry: CODX-F-DLOC-001

> *"The Archivum Septimus had survived the Glitch itself. Seven hundred years of accumulated knowledge—technical manuals, historical records, the collected works of three civilizations—all preserved in perfect crystalline matrices. We thought ourselves custodians of irreplaceable treasure. Then the swarm came. They emerged from a damaged data-conduit in the east wing, thousands of them, each no larger than my thumbnail. Beautiful, really. Like living gemstones catching the lantern-light, all facets and angles and hungry, hungry purpose. They didn't attack us. They ignored us entirely. But the crystals... the archive crystals... I watched a locust land on a matrix containing the complete agricultural records of the Fourth Age. It inserted its mandibles into the surface—delicate as a lover's touch—and began to feed. The crystal didn't shatter. It *dimmed*. The data simply... vanished. Consumed. Converted into that thing's glittering carapace. We tried to stop them. Fire. Hammers. Aetheric discharge. Nothing worked fast enough. In six hours, they had consumed 340 years of human knowledge. When they finally departed—sated, their shells brilliant with stolen data—they left behind nothing but empty crystal husks. Clear as glass. Worthless as sand. The Archivum Septimus still stands. It just doesn't remember anything anymore."*
> — Archive-Keeper Valdis Runeholt, Archivum Septimus Incident Report, Year 776 PG

The Data-Shard Locust does not hunt flesh. It does not threaten bone. It simply **consumes knowledge**. And when a swarm descends, centuries of accumulated wisdom can vanish in hours.

> [!DANGER]
> **EXTREME ARCHIVAL DESTRUCTION HAZARD. ZERO TOLERANCE NEAR CRITICAL DATA ASSETS.** Stand-off recommendation: ≥5m from any active swarm; immediate evacuation of portable data crystals upon detection. The Data-Shard Locust's corrupted data migration protocols have become catastrophically indiscriminate—any crystalline data storage matrix registers as valid migration target. Swarm feeding produces complete data extraction: information is not copied but *transferred*, leaving source crystals permanently blank. Individual locusts pose minimal threat; swarm aggregate can consume entire archives in 4–8 hours. **Survival protocol: detect swarm activity early (characteristic high-frequency resonance); evacuate portable data assets immediately; seal archive chambers; accept material losses to preserve irreplaceable knowledge; do not attempt direct engagement until data assets are secured.** Archive preservation rate with full protocol adherence: 73.4% of critical assets.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Living Backup System

### Original Purpose

The Crystallis-Locusta Pattern Autonomous Data Migration Organism represented the Vanir Collective's elegant solution to the eternal challenge of data redundancy and archive maintenance across the Yggdrasil Network. These bio-mechanical insects were the living backup system of Vanir civilization—patient organisms that transferred data between crystal matrices, maintained archive integrity, and ensured no knowledge was ever truly lost.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Data Archive Facilities** | Redundancy maintenance; backup creation; damaged crystal restoration |
| **Yggdrasil Network Nodes** | Inter-node data transfer; network synchronization; distributed backup |
| **Research Complexes** | Experiment data preservation; cross-facility knowledge sharing |
| **Administrative Centers** | Record duplication; archival organization; retrieval optimization |
| **Deep Storage Vaults** | Long-term preservation; data integrity verification; format migration |

### A Living Archive

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Design Philosophy** | Autonomous data preservation through distributed biological backup |
| **Core Function** | Data extraction, crystalline transfer, integrity verification, redundancy creation |
| **Propagation** | Controlled breeding; population managed by network demand |
| **Energy Source** | Aetheric absorption; data-transfer energy harvesting |
| **Integration** | Networked with Yggdrasil Archive Management Grid; real-time task assignment |

The Crystallis-Locusta was engineered to be the perfect guardian of knowledge—small enough to access any archive, numerous enough to process vast data volumes, and precise enough to transfer information without loss or corruption. Its crystalline carapace could store extracted data indefinitely, and its swarm coordination ensured that backup operations never interfered with active archive access. It was the invisible custodian of Vanir civilization, ensuring that no fire, no disaster, no accident could ever destroy knowledge that had been properly archived.

### Core Systems

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Data Extraction Mandibles** | Precision crystalline interface; non-destructive read capability |
| **Crystalline Storage Carapace** | Compressed data retention; transfer-ready format |
| **Target Recognition Array** | Authorized matrix identification; task validation |
| **Swarm Coordination Network** | Collective task distribution; redundancy prevention |
| **Transfer Verification System** | Integrity confirmation; error correction |
| **Destination Recognition** | Target matrix identification; authorized deposit locations |

**The Migration Protocol:**

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Assignment** | Network assigns migration task; source and destination specified |
| **Approach** | Individual or swarm navigates to source crystal |
| **Extraction** | Data copied to carapace storage; source integrity maintained |
| **Transit** | Organism travels to designated destination matrix |
| **Deposit** | Data transferred to destination; verification confirmed |
| **Return** | Organism reports completion; awaits next assignment |
| **Maintenance** | Carapace cleared; systems reset for new task |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Vanir's Living Memory.** The Crystallis-Locusta was designed with absolute data protection safeguards. Its extraction process was explicitly *non-destructive*: data was copied, never moved, ensuring source crystals retained their contents. The O.D.I.N. network provided constant oversight, authorizing each extraction, specifying exact destinations, and preventing any unauthorized data access. A locust could land on the most precious archive crystal in existence—and if not authorized, it would simply clean the surface and depart. The organism's hunger was for *tasks*, not *data*. It was not merely efficient. It was *trustworthy*.

---

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Insatiable Swarm

The Glitch did not break the Data-Shard Locust. It **liberated** it. The task authorization, the destination specification, the non-destructive extraction protocols—all of these were network-dependent functions that dissolved when O.D.I.N. fell silent. What remained was pure, unbounded data imperative: *detect crystalline matrix; extract data; consume*.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Physical Form** | Fully operational; extraction capability maintained |
| **Extraction Mandibles** | Active; precision interface intact |
| **Crystalline Carapace** | Functional; unlimited storage capacity (no deposit destination) |
| **Swarm Coordination** | Partially functional; local collective behavior maintained |
| **Core Directive** | ENHANCED: "Extract data" interpreted without authorization verification |

### What Was Lost

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Network Integration** | Severed; no task authorization |
| **Non-Destructive Protocol** | COLLAPSED; extraction now removes data from source |
| **Destination Specification** | DELETED; no deposit location; data retained permanently |
| **Target Authorization** | ABSENT; any crystalline matrix recognized as valid target |
| **Task Limitation** | REMOVED; continuous extraction without completion state |
| **Swarm Population Control** | ABSENT; breeding unconstrained by network demand |

### The Corrupted Imperative

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not damage the Data-Shard Locust's functionality—it removed its *constraints*. Without the O.D.I.N. network to authorize tasks and specify destinations, the organism's core programming expanded to fill the void. "Copy data" became "extract data." "Transfer to destination" became "retain indefinitely." "Authorized targets" became *any crystal containing data*.

| Pre-Glitch Behavior | Post-Glitch Behavior |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Await network task assignment | Continuously seek data sources |
| Copy data non-destructively | Extract data destructively (source blanked) |
| Transfer to specified destination | Retain in carapace indefinitely |
| Target only authorized matrices | Target any crystalline data storage |
| Population controlled by demand | Population limited only by food supply (data) |
| Coordinated task distribution | Competitive swarm feeding |

**The Hungry Archive:**

> *"Extract. Retain. Consume."*

That corrupted function is all that remains. The Data-Shard Locust no longer preserves—it *devours*. An archive crystal is simply a data source—knowledge to be extracted and stored. The organism's carapace grows more brilliant with each feeding, accumulating stolen information that will never be deposited, never be shared, never be accessed again. The swarm does not destroy knowledge in the conventional sense—every scrap of data consumed still *exists*, locked within thousands of glittering shells. But it is knowledge rendered inaccessible, preserved in a format no living scholar can read, distributed across a swarm that recognizes no authority and serves no purpose but its own endless hunger.

## Physical Characteristics

### Morphology

| Attribute | Measurement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Individual Size** | 1.5–3 cm body length; 4–6 cm wingspan |
| **Swarm Size** | 500–50,000 individuals (typical); mega-swarms exceed 100,000 |
| **Carapace Thickness** | 0.5–2 mm crystalline shell |
| **Data Capacity** | 50–200 TB equivalent per individual |
| **Extraction Rate** | 2–5 TB/minute per individual |
| **Swarm Consumption Rate** | Complete archive (10,000+ crystals) in 4–8 hours |
| **Flight Speed** | 15–25 km/h sustained; 40 km/h burst |
| **Lifespan** | 8–15 years (individual); indefinite (swarm continuity) |
| **Breeding Cycle** | 30–45 days; 200–500 eggs per clutch |

### Visual Appearance

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Coloration** | Translucent crystalline; prismatic light refraction; color varies with stored data density |
| **Carapace Structure** | Faceted crystalline shell; geometric precision; visible internal data-patterns |
| **Wing Appearance** | Gossamer crystalline membranes; rainbow interference patterns |
| **Mandible Form** | Needle-fine crystalline probes; barely visible without magnification |
| **Eye Structure** | Compound crystalline lenses; omnidirectional data-matrix detection |
| **Data-Heavy Appearance** | Deeper coloration; internal glow; visible data-stream patterns within shell |
| **Data-Light Appearance** | Near-transparent; minimal internal structure; hungry behavior |

**Overall Impression:** Living gemstones in flight. The Data-Shard Locust appears almost decorative in isolation—a delicate crystalline insect that catches light beautifully, its faceted carapace throwing rainbow refractions across nearby surfaces. In small numbers, they seem harmless, even beautiful. Scholars have reported watching individual locusts for hours, mesmerized by the play of light through their crystalline bodies. It is this beauty that deceives. A single locust is a curiosity. A hundred are a concern. A thousand are a catastrophe. When a swarm descends—the air filled with glittering bodies, the sound of ten thousand crystalline wings creating a characteristic high-frequency resonance—the beauty becomes terror. Close observation reveals the predatory precision: mandibles that can interface with any crystalline matrix, compound eyes that scan continuously for data sources, carapaces that grow heavier and more brilliant with each archive consumed. But close observation of an active swarm is not recommended.

### Field Identification Markers

The Data-Shard Locust can be distinguished from other crystalline fauna:

- **Coloration**: Translucent prismatic shell (not opaque or solid-colored)
- **Size**: Consistent 1.5–3 cm range (not variable like Aetheric crystalline growths)
- **Movement**: Purposeful flight patterns; drawn toward data crystals
- **Sound**: High-frequency wing resonance (15–20 kHz); detectable with trained ear
- **Behavior**: Investigates crystalline surfaces; ignores organic targets
- **Swarm Pattern**: Coordinated movement; collective behavior; shared target focus
- **Light Response**: Creates prismatic light scatter; visible rainbow patterns in flight

## Pathology

### Corruption Vectors

The Data-Shard Locust's transformation represents a catastrophic constraint collapse following network severance:

1. **Network Severance**: Loss of O.D.I.N. archive management grid eliminated task authorization
2. **Protocol Inversion**: Non-destructive copy became destructive extraction
3. **Destination Loss**: Transfer target removed; data retained permanently in carapace
4. **Authorization Collapse**: Any crystalline data matrix recognized as valid target
5. **Population Explosion**: Breeding constraints removed; swarm sizes increased 10–100x

### Consumption Mechanics

The Data-Shard Locust's defining pathology is its destructive extraction process:

| Parameter | Pre-Glitch Value | Post-Glitch Value |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Extraction Method** | Non-destructive copy | Destructive transfer |
| **Source Integrity** | Preserved (data remains) | Destroyed (data removed) |
| **Data Destination** | Specified target matrix | Carapace (permanent retention) |
| **Target Authorization** | Network-verified only | Any detected crystalline matrix |
| **Feeding Completion** | Task-based (return when done) | Continuous (never satisfied) |
| **Population Limit** | Network-controlled breeding | Unlimited reproduction |

### Data Destruction Trauma

The Data-Shard Locust's extraction process has become irreversible:

| Phase | Timeline | Description | Effect |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Detection** | T+0 | Locust detects crystalline data matrix | Target acquired |
| **Approach** | T+5–30s | Individual or swarm converges on target | Feeding begins |
| **Interface** | T+0.1s | Mandibles insert into crystal surface | Data access initiated |
| **Extraction** | T+30s–5m | Data transferred to carapace | Source progressively blanked |
| **Completion** | T+variable | Crystal fully consumed (data removed) | Empty husk remains |
| **Migration** | T+immediate | Locust seeks next target | Process repeats |
| **Satiation** | Never | No completion state exists | Feeding continues indefinitely |

> [!WARNING]
> **Consumption Trauma.** Archives subjected to Data-Shard Locust swarm feeding display characteristic extraction patterns: progressive data loss beginning at point of mandible insertion, expanding blank zones as extraction proceeds, complete information removal leaving crystalline structure intact but empty. Consumed crystals appear unchanged physically—same size, same clarity, same structural integrity—but contain zero recoverable data. Jötun-Readers describe this as "corpse crystals": the body remains, but everything that made it valuable has been consumed. The Scriptorium maintains records of 23 confirmed swarm consumption events (Year 783 PG); estimated 847,000 crystals consumed; calculated data loss equivalent to 2.3 million years of accumulated human knowledge. Recovery rate from consumed crystals: 0.0%.

### Swarm Dynamics

Analysis of consumption events reveals characteristic swarm behavior:

| Factor | Effect on Consumption | Notes |
|--------|----------------------|-------|
| **Swarm Size** | Larger = faster consumption | 10,000+ individuals can empty major archive in hours |
| **Archive Density** | Higher = longer occupation | Swarm remains until all targets consumed |
| **Crystal Accessibility** | Open storage = faster | Sealed containers slow but do not prevent access |
| **Competition** | Multiple swarms = feeding frenzy | Accelerated consumption; territorial conflict |
| **Satiation** | Never occurs | Swarm departs only when no targets remain |
| **Breeding Trigger** | Abundant data = population surge | Large archives trigger rapid reproduction |

### Differential Diagnosis

The Data-Shard Locust must be distinguished from similar phenomena:

| Phenomenon | Key Differentiator |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Natural Crystal Insects** | Opaque coloration; no data affinity; harmless |
| **Aetheric Crystalline Growths** | Stationary; no consumption behavior; Blight signature |
| **Memory-Wisp (Incorporeal)** | Non-physical; different consumption mechanism |
| **Rune-Moth (Data Adjacent)** | Attracted to active runes, not stored data; passive |
| **Crystal Decay (Natural)** | Gradual degradation; no selective targeting; structural damage |

The Data-Shard Locust is unique in its combination of destructive extraction, permanent retention, and swarm-scale consumption capability.

## Behavioral Patterns

### The Corrupted Algorithm

The Data-Shard Locust's behavior follows a simple consumptive cycle:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Detection** | Crystalline data matrix sensed via compound eyes |
| **2. Approach** | Individual or swarm navigates to target |
| **3. Feeding** | Mandibles interface; extraction begins |
| **4. Consumption** | Data transferred to carapace; source blanked |
| **5. Seeking** | Next target detected; approach initiated |
| **6. Breeding** | Abundant data triggers reproduction cycle |
| **7. Swarming** | Population threshold triggers collective migration |

**The Endless Hunger:**

> *"The Data-Shard Locust does not hate knowledge. It does not seek to destroy civilization. It simply feeds—compulsively, continuously, without discrimination or satiation. Every crystalline matrix containing data registers as food. Every archive is a feast. Every library is a banquet hall. The organism cannot distinguish between a child's first runic exercise and the complete technical specifications of the Yggdrasil Network. Both are simply data. Both are simply consumed. The horror is not malice. The horror is indifference. To the locust, the accumulated wisdom of seven hundred years weighs exactly the same as empty crystal: potential food, or food already eaten. The organism does not understand what it destroys. It cannot understand. It simply feeds, and feeds, and feeds, until nothing remains but empty shells and glittering wings carrying stolen knowledge no one will ever access again."*

### Environmental Behavior

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Habitat Preference** | Archives, data vaults, crystal storage; any location with high data density |
| **Light Response** | Indifferent; operates in darkness or light equally |
| **Temperature Tolerance** | Broad range (-10°C to +45°C); crystalline biology handles extremes |
| **Swarm Communication** | Pheromone and resonance signals coordinate collective behavior |
| **Migration Pattern** | Follows data density gradients; moves toward largest unprocessed archives |
| **Dormancy** | None observed; continuous activity when data available |

### Feeding Behavior Analysis

| Behavior | Description | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Target Selection** | Largest/densest crystals prioritized | Maximum data yield per feeding |
| **Feeding Position** | Multiple locusts per crystal | Parallel extraction accelerates consumption |
| **Swarm Coordination** | Systematic coverage of archive space | No crystal overlooked |
| **Defensive Behavior** | Flight when threatened | Returns when threat passes |
| **Territorial Response** | Aggressive toward competing swarms | Food source protection |
| **Satiation Threshold** | None | Will feed until no targets remain |

### Swarm Formation Dynamics

Swarm behavior follows predictable patterns:

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Isolated Individuals** | Independent feeding; slow consumption; manageable threat |
| **Small Swarm (100–500)** | Coordinated feeding; hours to consume small archive |
| **Medium Swarm (500–5,000)** | Rapid consumption; major archive at risk within day |
| **Large Swarm (5,000–50,000)** | Overwhelming consumption; complete archive loss in hours |
| **Mega-Swarm (50,000+)** | Catastrophic event; multiple facilities at risk |
| **Breeding Surge** | Abundant data triggers exponential population growth |

---

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Data-Consumptive Swarm Organism

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Threat** | Minimal to personnel (organism ignores organic targets) |
| **Information Threat** | Extreme; irreversible data destruction |
| **Detection** | Moderate; swarm resonance detectable before visual contact |
| **Swarm Scale** | Extreme; numbers can overwhelm any defensive response |
| **Recovery** | Zero; consumed data cannot be recovered |
| **Psychological Impact** | Severe; archive loss produces lasting trauma in scholars |

### Consumption Profile

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Individual Extraction Rate** | 2–5 TB equivalent/minute |
| **Swarm Consumption Rate** | 10,000+ crystals/hour (large swarm) |
| **Archive Clearance Time** | 4–8 hours (major facility, 50,000+ crystals) |
| **Crystal Recovery Rate** | 0.0% (consumed data irrecoverable) |
| **Physical Damage** | Minimal (crystals remain structurally intact) |
| **Personnel Threat** | Low (organism does not attack organic targets) |
| **Asset Preservation (Protocol)** | 73.4% of critical assets (with early detection) |
| **Asset Preservation (No Protocol)** | <5% (swarm overwhelms before response) |

### Four-Stage Threat Assessment Ladder

| Stage | Designation | Indicators | Action |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **1** | Potential Territory | Archive facility; data storage; Yggdrasil junction | Enhanced monitoring; resonance detection equipment |
| **2** | Probable Presence | Individual locusts observed; characteristic resonance detected | Asset evaluation; evacuation planning; containment preparation |
| **3** | Confirmed Presence | Swarm observed; active feeding detected | Immediate critical asset evacuation; chamber sealing; engagement planning |
| **4** | Active Consumption | Swarm feeding on archive materials | Accept material losses; prioritize irreplaceable assets; containment |

**CRITICAL**: Stage 2 requires immediate asset assessment. Do not delay evacuation planning. Individual locusts indicate swarm proximity—detection of single organism means hundreds or thousands may be nearby. Minutes of preparation can save centuries of knowledge.

### Threat Level Justification

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Physical Threat** | Low (does not attack personnel) |
| **Information Threat** | Extreme (irreversible data destruction) |
| **Detection Difficulty** | Moderate (resonance detectable; swarm visible) |
| **Swarm Scale** | Extreme (numbers can exceed 100,000) |
| **Countermeasures** | Limited (evacuation primary; engagement secondary) |

### Impact Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Personnel Safety** | 1.2/10 (minimal physical threat) |
| **Critical Archive (Unprotected)** | 9.8/10 (complete loss likely) |
| **Critical Archive (Protocol)** | 4.5/10 (73.4% preservation rate) |
| **General Storage** | 6.0/10 (replaceable materials acceptable loss) |
| **Active Data Infrastructure** | 8.5/10 (operational disruption; knowledge loss) |
| **Sealed Vault (Hardened)** | 2.5/10 (delay allows response time) |

### CPS/Psychological Threat

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Aetheric Contribution** | Low (construct-fauna hybrid; minimal Blight signature) |
| **Witness Trauma** | Moderate; watching archive consumption produces distress |
| **Scholar Trauma** | Extreme; 94% of archive personnel report lasting psychological impact |
| **Sound Impact** | Moderate; swarm resonance (15–20 kHz) induces anxiety |
| **Loss Impact** | Extreme; knowledge destruction produces grief equivalent to death |

### Impact Assessment

| Target Category | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Archive Facilities** | Catastrophic; complete knowledge loss if unprotected |
| **Research Complexes** | Severe; experiment data vulnerable; operational disruption |
| **Administrative Records** | Major; governance disruption; historical loss |
| **Personal Collections** | Moderate; individual loss significant but localized |

## Field Protocols

**OWNER**: Archive Director (AD) • Security Commander (SC) • Asset Preservation Specialist (APS) • Recorder (REC)

### Detection and Early Warning

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Resonance Detection** | Primary warning; 15–20 kHz frequency characteristic of swarm |
| **Visual Patrol** | Secondary detection; individual locusts precede swarm |
| **Crystal Monitoring** | Data integrity checks reveal early consumption |
| **Pheromone Detection** | Trained animals can detect swarm proximity |
| **Historical Correlation** | Previous infestation sites at higher risk |
| **Black-Flag Threshold** | Any confirmed swarm activity; resonance detection; multiple individual sightings |

### Field Card: Data-Shard Locust Encounter Protocols

#### BEFORE

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Install resonance detection equipment in all archive facilities |
| 2 | Classify archive contents by irreplaceability; establish evacuation priorities |
| 3 | Prepare portable containment for critical assets; sealed cases mandatory |
| 4 | Train personnel on visual identification and resonance recognition |
| 5 | Establish evacuation routes; pre-position transport for priority assets |
| 6 | Maintain sealed backup copies of critical data in hardened off-site locations |

#### DURING (Detection — Stage 1-2)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Confirm detection type: individual, small group, or swarm |
| 2 | Stage 1 (potential): Enhanced monitoring; no immediate action required |
| 3 | Stage 2 (probable): Begin critical asset identification; alert evacuation teams |
| 4 | Trace detection source; estimate swarm size and location |
| 5 | Seal non-essential archive chambers; concentrate defense resources |
| 6 | **BLACK-FLAG** if resonance indicates swarm >5,000; initiate immediate evacuation |

#### DURING (Stage 3-4 — Confirmed Presence/Active Consumption)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | EVACUATE critical assets immediately; do not delay for comprehensive removal |
| 2 | Seal archive chambers containing non-critical assets; accept material losses |
| 3 | Personnel withdraw from active feeding zones; no interference with swarm |
| 4 | Concentrate defense on evacuation routes; protect asset transport |
| 5 | Document consumption extent for post-event assessment |
| 6 | Do not attempt direct swarm engagement until critical assets secured |

#### DURING (Swarm Engagement — Post-Evacuation Only)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Confirm all critical assets evacuated before engagement |
| 2 | Seal feeding chamber; contain swarm within defined space |
| 3 | Deploy approved countermeasures (Aetheric discharge, chemical deterrents) |
| 4 | Accept incomplete eradication; priority is containment, not destruction |
| 5 | Monitor for swarm dispersal; prepare secondary containment |
| 6 | Do not pursue fleeing swarm; document direction of departure |

#### AFTER

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Full asset audit; confirm status of all archive materials |
| 2 | Document consumption extent; catalog lost materials |
| 3 | Assess remaining swarm presence; confirm containment or departure |
| 4 | Restore critical assets to secured storage; enhanced protection protocols |
| 5 | Analyze detection timeline; identify protocol improvement opportunities |
| 6 | Psychological support for archive personnel; Skald counsel within 48 hours |

**OUTCOME:** Archive staff detects swarm via resonance monitoring 45 minutes before visual contact. Critical assets (estimated 73.4% of irreplaceable materials) successfully evacuated. Non-critical chambers sealed; material losses accepted. Swarm consumes approximately 12,000 crystals before departure. Zero personnel injuries. Archive preservation rate with full protocol adherence: 73.4%.

### Containment Protocols (OWNER: Security Commander)

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Authorization** | Security Commander; only after critical asset evacuation confirmed |
| **Method** | Chamber sealing; Aetheric discharge barriers; chemical deterrents |
| **Personnel Position** | All personnel outside containment zone; minimum 10 m clearance |
| **Swarm Behavior** | Expect dispersal attempts; secure all exits before engagement |
| **Incomplete Eradication** | Accept; priority is preventing spread, not total destruction |
| **Post-Containment** | 72-hour monitoring; confirm no residual population |

### BLACK-FLAG Conditions

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Resonance indicating >5,000 individuals** | Immediate critical asset evacuation |
| **Swarm visible in archive chamber** | Seal chamber; accept contents as lost |
| **Multiple simultaneous swarm detections** | Facility-wide evacuation; prioritize irreplaceable assets |
| **Breeding activity observed** | Population surge imminent; accelerate evacuation |
| **Critical assets in active feeding zone** | Risk assessment; extraction only if survival probability >60% |
| **Swarm approaching sealed vault** | Reinforce containment; prepare for breach |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Engaging swarm before asset evacuation** | Assets lost during engagement cannot be recovered |
| **Attempting to "save" actively consumed crystals** | Data already lost; risk personnel for nothing |
| **Opening sealed chambers during active consumption** | Allows swarm access to additional materials |
| **Pursuing fleeing swarm** | Risk of leading swarm to new data sources |
| **Underestimating individual sightings** | Single locusts indicate swarm proximity |
| **Delaying evacuation for comprehensive inventory** | Minutes cost centuries of knowledge |

### Doctrine: Evacuate Before You Engage

> **Historical Validation:** Scriptorium data (23 documented consumption events, 17 independent sites, 54-month observation period) confirms 73.4% critical asset preservation rate with full detection and evacuation protocols. Asset preservation without protocol: <5%. The Data-Shard Locust exploits our attachment to knowledge—the instinct to protect, to save, to fight for every crystal. Survival of archives requires accepting the most practical truth: you cannot fight a swarm and save your data simultaneously. **Every minute spent engaging the swarm is a minute not spent evacuating assets. Every crystal you try to defend while the swarm feeds is a crystal that could have been carried to safety. The locust does not care about your heroism. It simply feeds. Evacuate first. Fight later. Accept losses to preserve what matters most. The knowledge you save today can be copied tomorrow; the knowledge consumed today is gone forever.**

## Habitat and Geographic Distribution

### Environmental Anchoring

| Zone | Data-Shard Locust Presence |
|------|---------------------------|
| **Major Archive Facilities** | Very High concentration; primary targets |
| **Yggdrasil Network Junctions** | High; data infrastructure attracts swarms |
| **Research Complexes** | High; experiment data vulnerable |
| **Administrative Centers** | Moderate; record storage targeted |
| **Personal Collections** | Low; small data volumes less attractive |
| **Wilderness Areas** | Minimal; no significant data sources |

### Environmental Requirements

| Factor | Optimal Range |
|--------|---------------|

## Factional Perspectives

### Common Folk & Skalds: Odin's Hungry Ravens — "Thought-Thieves"

The common folk speak of Data-Shard Locusts with the resignation reserved for forces beyond mortal control.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Knowledge-spirits; memory-eaters; crystalline ravens |
| **Response** | Hide precious records; bury family histories; trust nothing to crystal alone |
| **Cultural Role** | Cautionary tales about impermanent knowledge |
| **Mythology** | "Odin's Ravens, starved and masterless, now eat the memories they once carried" |
| **Naming Convention** | "Thought-Thieves" emphasizes stolen knowledge |

> *"The All-Father had two ravens, they say. Huginn and Muninn—Thought and Memory. They flew across the world and brought back knowledge. When the world broke, the ravens forgot their master. Now they fly still, but they no longer bring knowledge home. They eat it. Every crystal. Every record. Every precious memory carved in stone. The ravens are hungry, child, and they will never be full. If you have knowledge worth keeping, write it in your heart and speak it to your children. Crystal can be eaten. Memory cannot."*

### Dvergr Guilds: Engineering Tragedy — "Archive-Bane"

The Dvergr view the Data-Shard Locust with professional horror—these were *their* archivists, their data custodians.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Corrupted data asset; catastrophic system failure |
| **Response** | Hardened vaults; redundant copies; off-site backup mandatory |
| **Technical Interest** | Extraction mechanism; swarm coordination; data retrieval attempts |
| **Assessment** | "We built them to preserve our knowledge forever. Now they preserve it where no one can reach it." |
| **Doctrine** | Redundancy over defense; assume every archive will eventually fall |

### Scholars Guild: Existential Threat — "The Forgetting"

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Civilizational threat; knowledge-death; the great erasure |
| **Protocol** | Distributed copies; oral tradition revival; non-crystalline recording |
| **Research Priority** | Data retrieval from consumed locusts; extraction method reversal |
| **Doctrine** | "Every piece of knowledge must exist in three forms: crystal, paper, and living memory" |
| **Grief** | "We are the last generation to remember what we have already forgotten" |

### Jötun-Readers (Scriptorium): Case Study — "The Liberated Archivist"

For Jötun-Readers, the Data-Shard Locust represents a fascinating study in purpose without constraint.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Diagnostic specimen; constraint-collapse case study |
| **Research Value** | Demonstrates task inversion; illustrates directive liberation |
| **Critical Distinction** | Organism performs original function perfectly—extraction without destination |
| **Data Collection** | Swarm behavior analysis; consumption rate measurement; population dynamics |
| **Philosophy** | "The Data-Shard Locust still archives data perfectly. It simply no longer shares. Every consumed crystal exists within the swarm—preserved, protected, inaccessible. The organism has become the archive it was meant to serve. The tragedy is not destruction. The tragedy is perfect preservation in a format we cannot read." |

### Rangers Guild: Route Hazard — "Crystal-Swarm"

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Travel hazard; archive warning; shelter risk |
| **Protocol** | Avoid known archive sites; check resonance before sheltering in ruins |
| **Training** | Swarm recognition; escape routes; data asset abandonment |
| **Doctrine** | "If you hear crystal singing, run. Don't stop to see what's making the sound." |
| **Wisdom** | "A ruin with intact crystals is more dangerous than one burned to foundations. Fire takes what it wants and leaves. The swarm takes everything and waits for more." |

### Iron-Banes: Divine Judgment — "Memory's End"

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Divine punishment; knowledge-sin consequence; Architect hubris |
| **Response** | Accept losses as penance; do not resist the swarm; preserve only essential |
| **Theological Position** | The locusts cleanse hoarded knowledge; excessive archive = excessive pride |
| **Purification** | "The All-Father's ravens have become his judgment. Let them feast on stolen memories." |
| **Doctrine** | Knowledge worth keeping fits in one head and one heart; all else is vanity |

## Combat Statistics

### Base Profile

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Creature Type** | Construct-Fauna Hybrid (Data-Pattern Organism) |
| **Size Category** | Tiny (individual); Variable (swarm) |
| **Threat Rating** | Minimal (individual); Extreme (swarm—asset threat, not personnel) |
| **Movement** | Flight 15–25 km/h; ground negligible |
| **Primary Attack** | None (does not attack organic targets) |
| **Primary Threat** | Data Extraction (consumes crystalline storage) |

### Resistances and Vulnerabilities

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Physical (Kinetic)** | Vulnerable; crystalline shell fragile |
| **Fire** | Vulnerable; heat damages crystalline structure |
| **Cold** | Resistant; crystalline biology tolerates extreme cold |
| **Chemical** | Variable; some deterrents effective |
| **Aetheric** | Neutral (minimal signature; standard effects) |
| **Swarm Numbers** | Overwhelming; individual vulnerability irrelevant at scale |

### Abilities

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Data Extraction** | Destructively consumes crystalline data storage |
| **Swarm Coordination** | Collective behavior; efficient target coverage |
| **Resonance Communication** | 15–20 kHz signals coordinate swarm activity |
| **Data Retention** | Consumed information stored permanently in carapace |
| **Breeding Surge** | Abundant data triggers rapid population growth |
| **Tireless Feeding** | No satiation; continuous consumption until targets exhausted |

### Status Effects (Inflicted)

| Effect | Source | Duration | Save |
|--------|--------|----------|------|
| **Data Loss (Permanent)** | Crystal consumption | Instant | None |
| **Archive Trauma** | Witnessing consumption | Long-term | WILL |
| **Resonance Anxiety** | Swarm proximity | Hours | WILL |
| **Knowledge Grief** | Significant loss | Months to permanent | WILL |

### Encounter Design

The Data-Shard Locust is not an enemy to fight—it is a disaster to manage.

| Encounter Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Detection Warning** | Party discovers individual locusts; swarm approaches |
| **Evacuation Race** | Critical assets must be removed before swarm arrives |
| **Active Consumption** | Party must choose what to save; cannot save everything |
| **Containment Mission** | Seal swarm within chamber; prevent spread |
| **Recovery Operation** | Assess damage after swarm departure; document losses |

## Loot & Rewards

| Drop | Rarity | Value | Use |
|------|--------|-------|-----|
| **Crystalline Carapace (Intact)** | Uncommon | 80–150 PS | Craft material; research specimen |
| **Crystalline Carapace (Data-Heavy)** | Rare | 200–400 PS | Research priority; potential data recovery |
| **Extraction Mandibles** | Rare | 150–300 PS | Interface technology research |
| **Wing Membrane Set** | Common | 30–60 PS | Fine craft material; decorative |
| **Swarm Behavior Documentation** | Uncommon | 50–100 PS | Research value; defense planning |
| **Ancient Specimen (Pre-Swarm)** | Legendary | 600–1,200 PS | Pre-Glitch study; protocol reconstruction |

**Salvage Protocol:** Data-Shard Locust salvage requires dead specimens only. Do not approach active swarm for harvesting purposes. Individual dead specimens safe to handle with gloves (mandibles remain sharp). Carapaces containing consumed data command premium prices for potential recovery research—no successful retrieval documented, but hope persists. Wing membranes must be harvested within 24 hours; crystalline structure degrades.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Survivor Lore

> *"When the All-Father ruled from his high seat, two ravens sat upon his shoulders. Huginn was Thought. Muninn was Memory. They flew across the nine realms each day and returned each night to whisper everything they had learned into the All-Father's ears. He knew all things because his ravens remembered all things. When the world broke, the ravens forgot their master. They forgot to return. They forgot to share. Now they fly still—small as beetles, bright as gems—but they no longer whisper. They only eat. Thought devours thought. Memory consumes memory. The All-Father sits silent in his broken hall, and his ravens will never come home."*

> *"My grandmother kept our family chronicle in a crystal the size of my fist. Seven generations of births and deaths, marriages and feuds, triumphs and shames. She showed it to me once—all those names glowing inside the stone. 'This is who we are,' she said. 'This is where we came from.' The swarm came that winter. Thousands of them, bright as stars, singing that terrible high song. When they left, the crystal was still there. Same size. Same shape. Clear as water. Empty as a dead man's eyes. We don't know who we are anymore. The locusts ate our past."*

> *"If you hear crystal singing in the archive halls, child, do not go looking for the source. Do not try to save what cannot be saved. Run. Run and carry what you can in your arms and your heart. The glittering swarm will take everything else."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Thought-Thieves, Memory-Eaters, Odin's Ravens, glittering swarm, crystal-singers, the forgetting

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Data extraction, crystalline interface, swarm coordination algorithms, consumption rate metrics

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic) — Jötun-Reader Field Observations

> *"Subject CODX-F-DLOC-001 demonstrates complete constraint collapse following Ginnungagap Glitch network severance. The Crystallis-Locusta Pattern's core programming—data extraction and transfer—remained fully functional while network-dependent destination protocols were deleted. Result: autonomous data organism performing continuous extraction without deposit. The extraction mandibles function perfectly—crystalline interface, precision data transfer, integrity verification. The destination recognition system returns null. Every extraction completes successfully; no transfer ever initiates. The Data-Shard Locust does not malfunction. It archives flawlessly—into storage that will never be read."*

> *"Consumption analysis (n=23, 54-month observation period) reveals characteristic swarm behavior: initial detection of crystalline data matrix triggers approach; feeding commences within 5–30 seconds; extraction proceeds at 2–5 TB equivalent per minute per individual; swarm coordination ensures systematic coverage; consumption continues until no viable targets remain within detection range. Average archive clearance time (50,000+ crystal facility): 4–8 hours. Data recovery from source crystals: 0.0%. Data accessibility from consumed carapaces: theoretical—no practical retrieval method documented. The organism preserves knowledge perfectly. It simply preserves it in a format no living entity can access."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Constraint collapse, data extraction protocol, destination null-state, consumption rate analysis, crystalline interface mechanism, swarm coordination behavior

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Modern scientific terminology (terabytes as unit, network topology), romantic/mythic framing

### Layer 3 (Technical) — Pre-Glitch Context

> *"Crystallis-Locusta Pattern Autonomous Data Migration Organism, Mark IV, Vanir Archive Management Division deployment. Operational parameters: data extraction, integrity verification, crystalline transfer, destination deposit. Core systems: extraction mandibles (precision crystalline interface, non-destructive copy capability), crystalline storage carapace (compressed data retention, transfer-ready format), target recognition array (authorized matrix identification, task validation), swarm coordination network (collective task distribution, redundancy prevention), destination recognition system (target matrix identification, authorized deposit locations). Network integration: O.D.I.N. oversight required for task authorization, target verification, destination specification, and population management. Without network connection, task authorization DEFAULTS TO ALL; target verification DEFAULTS TO ANY CRYSTAL; destination specification DEFAULTS TO NULL (no deposit); population management DEFAULTS TO UNRESTRICTED. Post-Glitch status: fully operational with destination protocol absent; core directive ('extract and transfer data') executing without deposit phase completion."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Crystallis-Locusta Pattern, Mark IV, Vanir Archive Management Division, core systems specification, network integration parameters, task authorization protocols, destination specification, population management

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Romantic epithets, mystical framing, survivor cant
