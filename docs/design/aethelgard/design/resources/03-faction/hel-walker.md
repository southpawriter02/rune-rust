# The Hel-Walkers — Pilgrims of the Roaring Heart

> *"The Kettle roars and the weak names peel away. Give iron, sealed and silent. Keep to the rope when the bell speaks. Touch not the false air. Walk until the skin remembers the hymn. Where the steam lifts, leave fear in the noise and be made clean."*
> — Fragment of Hel-Walker Creed, recorded at Rust-Gate Perimeter

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Classification** | Extremist Apostasy (Dual Schism) |
| **Common Names** | The Damned, Cult of the Roaring Kettle, Pilgrims of Filth |
| **Core Philosophy** | Purification Through Suffering; Apotheosis Through Poison |
| **Primary Territory** | Helheim Chemical Sump; Rusting Labyrinth |
| **Leadership Structure** | Hierarchy of Suffering (disfigurement-based authority) |
| **Relationship to Blight** | Embrace, absorb, transcend |

The Hel-Walkers are not a faction in any conventional sense. They are a collective madness given ambulatory form—a death cult that has transformed Helheim's Chemical Sump and Rusting Labyrinth into a slow-motion ritual of self-immolation. The Dvergr garrison at Garm's Watch maintains a single designation for them in official logs: **the Damned**.

This is not poetic license.

It is operational taxonomy.

Where the Iron-Banes seek to destroy the corruption and the God-Sleepers seek to worship it, the Hel-Walkers pursue the most terrifying alternative: they seek to **become** it.

## Core Dogma: The World Is Not Sick—It Is Sacred

### The Divine Poison

| Iron-Banes Say | God-Sleepers Say | Hel-Walkers Know |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| "The machines are demons in iron bodies." | "The machines are sleeping gods." | "The poison is the gods' purest essence." |
| "Purify and cleanse." | "Pray and await awakening." | "Immerse and transcend." |
| "Destroy the spiritual plague." | "Worship the divine remnants." | "Become one with the eternal machine." |

The Hel-Walkers do not view Helheim as a wasteland or a cursed ruin. They see it as the **holiest ground in Aethelgard**—the deepest root of the World-Tree, where the raw, unfiltered essence of the Slumbering Gods flows in rivers of caustic brine.

> *"The surface dwellers fear the Roaring Heart. They seal themselves in suits and masks, trembling at every breath. They do not understand. The poison is not the enemy. The poison is the truth. It burns away the lies our flesh tells us. It strips the weak names from our souls. It makes us ready for the Eternal."*

### The Theology of Apotheosis

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Goal** | Physical and spiritual merger with "the eternal machine" |
| **Method** | Progressive toxic exposure as spiritual advancement |
| **Sacred Truth** | Pain is purification; mutation is blessing; death is apotheosis |
| **Timeline** | Personal; measured in lesions, tumors, and scars |

The Hel-Walkers believe that the human body is a prison of weak, organic flesh that must be **burned away**. Through deliberate exposure to Helheim's toxins, they shed their mortality layer by layer, preparing their souls for final transformation into perfect, imperishable machine-essence.

This is not death.

This is graduation.

## Origins: The Schism of the Damned

### The Dual Heresy

The Hel-Walkers are not indigenous to Helheim. They are the terminal endpoint of theological radicalization—the point where doctrinal extremism crosses from dangerous ideology into collective suicide.

| Parent Creed | Heretical Interpretation |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Iron-Bane Crusade** | True purification requires *enduring* corruption, not destroying it |
| **God-Sleeper Cults** | True communion requires *merging* with divine essence, not merely worshipping it |

Both the Iron-Bane Crusade and the God-Sleeper Cults have issued formal excommunication decrees against the Hel-Walkers, rejecting them as heretical offshoots too dangerous to acknowledge as kin.

Yet the disowned children remain.

### The Iron-Bane Heresy: Endurance as Purification

| Orthodox Doctrine | Hel-Walker Inversion |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Destroy the taint to prove purity | Endure the taint to prove strength |
| Fire cleanses the corrupt | Fire tempers the soul |
| The world is the forge | Helheim is the universe's cruelest forge |

Where orthodox Iron-Banes destroy contamination to achieve purity, the Hel-Walker heresy teaches that true purification requires **endurance** of contamination. Just as steel is strengthened by exposure to fire, human souls can be purified by exposure to the most concentrated toxins the broken world offers.

Chemical burns become sacred scars.

Physical mutation becomes evidence of spiritual progress.

Death by poison becomes the ultimate proof of successfully completed purification.

### The God-Sleeper Apostasy: Merging with the Holy Roots

| Orthodox Doctrine | Hel-Walker Inversion |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| The gods sleep in their mechanical bodies | The gods' essence flows through Helheim's veins |
| Await the Great Awakening | Accelerate personal transformation |
| Venerate from a respectful distance | Immerse directly in divine substance |

God-Sleeper theology identifies Helheim as the deepest foundation of the Yggdrasil Network—the roots from which the entire system drew sustenance. The Hel-Walker apostasy extends this reasoning to its breaking point: if Helheim represents the most fundamental realm, it must contain the **most concentrated essence** of divine presence.

The toxic sludge of the Chemical Sump becomes "the raw, unfiltered blood of the Slumbering Gods."

The corrosive atmosphere becomes "the breath of dreaming deities."

The Hvergelmir Anomaly becomes the **Roaring Heart**—the concentrated core of divine power accessible nowhere else in the broken world.

### The Founding Pilgrims

| Era | Event |
|-----|-------|
| **Age of Wandering** | First descents by charismatic extremists (50–100 years Post-Glitch) |
| **Excommunication** | Formal rejection by parent Creeds (~65–70 years Post-Glitch) |
| **Establishment** | First permanent cult presence in Chemical Sump corridors |
| **Current** | 200–400 adherents across 8–12 nomadic bands |

The first Hel-Walker pilgrimages were likely led by charismatic, yet profoundly deluded, individuals who interpreted the seismic groans of Helheim's vast, broken industrial complexes as divine calls—or the pervasive psychic stress of the Hvergelmir Anomaly as sacred vision.

---

## Theology: The Sacred Disease Doctrine

### Pain as Sacrament

| Surface Logic | Hel-Walker Truth |
|---------------|------------------|
| Pain is suffering to be minimized | Pain is "holy trial"—evidence of divine attention |
| Chemical burns are injuries | Chemical burns are "kiss-marks" from sacred essence |
| Tumors are pathology | Tumors are "lanterns"—internal illumination |
| Gray-green pallor is poisoning | Discoloration is "first coloring"—metal replacing flesh |

The Hel-Walker theology inverts conventional medical frameworks, reinterpreting pathology as spiritual progress. The doctrine establishes a **Hierarchy of Suffering** that determines spiritual authority within cult bands.

Physical strength, tactical competence, practical survival skills—metrics that govern leadership in conventional factions—hold minimal value in Hel-Walker social calculus.

Authority accrues to those displaying the **most extensive visible disfigurement**.

### The Five Markers of Advancement

| Marker | Theological Meaning |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Chemical Burns** | Kiss-marks from contact with sacred essence |
| **Glowing Tumors** | Lanterns; mechanical components forming beneath skin |
| **Gray-Green Pallor** | First coloring; skin transitioning from flesh to metal |
| **Ferrous Discoloration** | Rust-blessing; iron replacing organic tissue |
| **Numbness** | Transcendence of pain sensation; approaching apotheosis |

The hierarchy creates perverse incentive structures that accelerate mortality. Cultists seeking higher status deliberately expose themselves to greater hazards, competing to display more extreme disfigurement than their peers.

This competition manifests in progressively riskier ritual behavior—longer immersion durations in toxic brine, more frequent mask removal in contaminated atmosphere, and increasingly close approaches to high-toxicity zones.

The five-year average lifespan represents not merely environmental hazard but **active theological selection pressure** driving cultists toward lethal extremes.

## Hvergelmir Worship: The Roaring Heart

### The Living God

| Physical Reality | Theological Interpretation |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| Perpetual toxic eruption at Helheim's nadir | The Roaring Heart of the True World |
| pH 1.8–2.2 caustic brine | Sacred blood; divine tears |
| 650–850°C superheated plumes | The breath of purification |
| Stage-4 CPS death zone | The threshold of apotheosis |

The Hvergelmir Anomaly is the cult's supreme object of veneration—a perpetual toxic eruption at Helheim's deepest accessible point. The cult's theological framework assigns sacred significance to every physical characteristic of the Anomaly.

> *"The Roaring Heart does not sleep like the Silent Gods of the surface shrines. It speaks. It breathes. It calls to those with ears to hear. The unworthy dissolve in its presence—their weak names scattered like ash. But the prepared, the purified, the truly faithful... they do not dissolve. They transform."*

### The Approach of Apotheosis

| Distance from Anomaly | CPS Reading | Theological Status |
|-----------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 800+ meters | 0.7–0.9 | Safe approach; pilgrim territory |
| 400–800 meters | 1.2–1.8 | Testing ground; proving faith |
| 200–400 meters | 2.0–2.5 | Threshold of transformation |
| <200 meters | 2.5–3.5+ | Zone of apotheosis; unsurvivable |

No documented cases support the belief that sufficient spiritual purity allows survival at close approach—all observed attempts have resulted in death or Forlorn transformation—yet the theology remains unfalsified within the cult's framework because survivors capable of reporting negative results do not exist.

---

## Society and Structure: The Grand Descent

### Nomadic Existence

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Settlement Type** | None; perpetual pilgrimage |
| **Band Size** | 20–40 individuals per band |
| **Total Population** | 200–400 across 8–12 bands |
| **Movement Pattern** | Follow toxic flow gradients and machinery acoustics |
| **Average Lifespan** | 5 years post-descent; Soot-Sages may reach 7–8 years |

The Hel-Walkers maintain no permanent settlements. Their existence is defined by the **Grand Descent**—perpetual movement through Helheim's corroded infrastructure toward zones of increasing toxicity.

The descent terminology references both physical movement toward deeper Helheim strata and metaphorical descent into greater levels of purification through intensified exposure.

The pilgrimage has no destination except death.

### The Hierarchy of Suffering

| Rank | Basis | Authority |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **Initiates** | Recent converts; minimal disfigurement | Follow; observe; learn the rites |
| **Pilgrims** | Established cultists; visible pathology | Full participation in rituals |
| **Elder Pilgrims** | Extensive disfigurement; 3–5 years survival | Guide ritual practice; adjudicate disputes |
| **Soot-Sages** | Maximum disfigurement; longest survival | Spiritual authority; theological interpretation |

Decision-making operates through consensus among acknowledged Elders, weighted by suffering markers. When bands face tactical questions, the most disfigured members voice opinions first, and their recommendations carry disproportionate social weight.

### Material Culture

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Environmental Suits** | Deliberately maintained at 40–60% integrity |
| **Rebreathers** | Scavenged Dvergr units at 50–60% filter capacity |
| **Ornamentation** | Corroded metal fragments as ritual decoration |
| **Captured Equipment** | Deliberately sabotaged to render it "purified" |

Hel-Walker appearance serves as both theological statement and operational warning sign. Where surface expeditions rely on sealed atmospheric suits, Hel-Walkers wear patchwork assemblages deliberately maintained in states of partial failure.

Exposure is **intentional** rather than accidental.

## Sump-Cant: The Lexicon of Filth

### The Language of Transformation

The Hel-Walkers have developed their own specialized vocabulary—**Sump-Cant**—that reinforces their inverted worldview and sanctifies their suffering.

| Term | Meaning | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| **The Roaring Heart** | Hvergelmir Anomaly | "We walk toward the Roaring Heart." |
| **Kiss-Marks** | Chemical burns | "She bears many kiss-marks; she is beloved." |
| **Lanterns** | Glowing tumors | "His lanterns shine bright; apotheosis nears." |
| **Weak Names** | Pre-conversion identities | "The weak names peel away in the steam." |
| **The Eternal** | Apotheosized state; death | "He has joined the Eternal." |
| **Surface-Blind** | Non-believers; expedition members | "The surface-blind fear the breath." |
| **The Baptism** | Hvergelmir Sacrament; brine immersion | "Prepare the baptism pool." |
| **Decompression** | Ritual completion; truce period | "Bell cadence signals decompression." |

### Theological Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **The Grand Descent** | Perpetual pilgrimage toward apotheosis |
| **Sacred Blood** | Toxic brine of the Chemical Sump |
| **Divine Breath** | Corrosive atmosphere of Helheim |
| **The First Coloring** | Gray-green pallor of heavy metal poisoning |
| **Machine-Soul** | Perfected state after transformation |
| **The Threshold** | CPS death zone surrounding Hvergelmir |

---

## The Sacred Rites: Rituals of Transformation

### The Hvergelmir Sacrament (Baptism of Filth)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Participants** | 5–20 cultists per ceremony |
| **Medium** | Chemical Sump brine (pH 1.8–2.2) |
| **Duration** | 5–15 minutes (survival window); >20 minutes is lethal |
| **Accompaniment** | Synchronized guttural chanting; ritualized self-mutilation |
| **Purpose** | Accelerated spiritual advancement through controlled poisoning |

The sacrament involves full-body immersion in Chemical Sump brine during communal ceremonies. Participants engage in synchronized guttural chanting during immersion, deliberately remove respiratory protection to inhale toxic vapor, and perform ritualized self-mutilation using corroded metal implements to create open wounds that maximize toxin uptake.

The ritual effectively functions as repeated near-death experience, psychologically reinforcing theological commitment through survived trauma.

### Resonance Chants

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Volume** | 40–70 decibels |
| **Cadence** | 6–8 minute cycles mirroring Hvergelmir convection |
| **Sound** | Guttural vocalization replicating mechanical hum |
| **Effect** | Amplifies Runic Blight psychic influence; induces shared hallucination |

The chants serve multiple functions: cohesion signal in low-visibility zones, psychological conditioning through shared "visions," and territorial warning to surface expeditions.

### Sacrifice to the Kettle

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Victims** | Captured surface expedition members |
| **Method** | Cast into toxic brine or geothermal vents |
| **Location** | Hvergelmir perimeter (~800m distance) |
| **Frequency** | 1–3 per month (correlates with capture rate) |
| **Theological Purpose** | "Feeding the Roaring Heart"; returning impure flesh to the forge |

### The Silent Feast

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Consumed** | Blight-mutated flora and fauna |
| **Preparation** | None; raw consumption during communal ceremony |
| **Physiological Basis** | Cultists develop specialized digestive enzymes over months of exposure |
| **Theological Meaning** | Direct internalization of divine poison; communion with Hvergelmir's essence |

---

## Replenishment: The Cycle of the Damned

### Why They Cannot Self-Sustain

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Fertility** | Toxic exposure renders all members sterile within months |
| **Lifespan** | 5-year average; maximum 7–8 years |
| **Reproduction** | Physiologically impossible |
| **Sustaining Population** | Requires continuous external recruitment |

### Recruitment Methods

| Method | Rate | Success |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Voluntary Descent** | 2–5 per year | 100% (by definition) |
| **Forced Conversion** | 8–12 capture incidents per year | ~40% conversion rate |

Voluntary recruitment draws from the most extreme elements of surface theology—individuals who have exhausted all other options for expressing their radical beliefs within orthodox frameworks.

Forced conversion subjects captives to accelerated "baptism rites" designed to break resistance within 30–90 days: repeated immersion in diluted toxic brine, deliberate mask removal, constant resonance chanting creating sleep deprivation, and social isolation with exclusive cult interaction.

Survivors who resist successfully demonstrate profound psychological trauma—persistent nightmares of the Hvergelmir Anomaly, auditory hallucinations mimicking cult chants, and acute anxiety triggered by industrial machinery sounds.

Those who succumb display personality discontinuity consistent with identity dissolution.

The remaining 60% of capture victims die during the conversion process.

The cult interprets these deaths not as failure but as **successful apotheosis**.

---

## Border Interactions: The Amber Protocols

### The Truce Mechanics

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Signal** | Rope-line perimeter at 8–10m standoff |
| **Indicator** | Bell cadence: 2 short, 1 sustained (90-second intervals) |
| **Duration** | 2–4 hours during active rites |
| **Authority** | Warden (crowd); Ranger (standoff); Clerk (tithe log) |

When Hel-Walker bands approach within 200 meters of Scar Perimeter settlements while conducting religious rites, they establish rope-line perimeters signaling **amber posture**: conditional tolerance rather than active hostility.

### The Passage Tithe

| Payment Type | Quantity |
|--------------|----------|
| **Inert Metal** | 50–200 grams (copper, tin, scrap iron) |
| **Sealed Water** | 1–5 liters per convoy |
| **High-Risk Supplement** | Watch-fire fuel + filter stock |

The cult demonstrates surprising flexibility regarding metal purity—they accept corroded, contaminated, or degraded materials. This reflects theological rather than practical valuation: metals are desired for ritual incorporation into Hvergelmir Sacrament sites, where they corrode further and become "offerings to the Roaring Heart."

### Common Note Rules

| Do | Do Not |
|----|--------|
| Give iron or water | Cross the rope |
| Stay beyond rope | Touch the smoke |
| Observe bell cadence | Speak the names |
| Log all exchanges | Approach during immersion |

## Factional Relations

### The Iron-Bane Crusade: Excommunicated Heretics

| Hel-Walker View | Iron-Bane View |
|-----------------|----------------|
| "They destroy what they should endure." | "Children who gazed too long into the abyss." |
| "Their fire cleanses nothing; it merely delays." | "Heretics beyond redemption; worse than the machines." |
| "We will outlast their hammers." | "Hunt them alongside the Iron-Husks." |

The Iron-Banes view the Hel-Walkers as the **ultimate perversion** of their own creed—proof of what happens when purification theology is taken to suicidal extremes. Border Quench Pacts occasionally bring Bane raiders into proximity with cult territory, creating compound hazard requiring Warden coordination.

### The God-Sleeper Cults: Disowned Apostates

| Hel-Walker View | God-Sleeper View |
|-----------------|------------------|
| "They worship from afar; we commune directly." | "They misunderstand the nature of sacred merger." |
| "Their shrines are pale imitations of the Roaring Heart." | "They have corrupted the path of transformation." |
| "We have found what they only dream of." | "Embarrassing extremists we cannot publicly acknowledge." |

God-Sleeper condemnations read as **embarrassed distancing** rather than theological fury. The cult represents a logical extrapolation of core Sleeper beliefs taken to extremes the parent Creed cannot publicly acknowledge without undermining its own theological foundations.

### The Jötun-Readers: Surface-Blind Fools

| Hel-Walker View | Jötun-Reader View |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| "They seek understanding; we have transcendence." | "Pathological extreme of post-Glitch human adaptation." |
| "Their masks prove their weakness." | "Annihilation as sacrament; survival logic inverted." |
| "Expedition members make acceptable offerings." | "Red-zone classification: avoid, do not engage." |

The Scriptorium classifies Hel-Walkers as a **Stage-3 territorial interdiction hazard** with secondary abduction risk. Rangers Guild protocols designate all cult territory as red-zone.

### The Dvergr: Gatekeepers and Witnesses

| Hel-Walker View | Dvergr View |
|-----------------|-------------|
| "The iron-blooded ones seal us in our temple." | "The Damned. Operational taxonomy, not poetry." |
| "Their Watch cannot hold forever." | "Containment priority; suppression infeasible." |
| "They will learn the truth when the Roaring Heart claims them." | "Log everything; trust nothing; filter integrity at all times." |

Garm's Watch maintains the primary chokepoint controlling authorized descent into Helheim. The Dvergr garrison processes 80–120 expedition transits per month, each requiring 45–90 minutes of decontamination protocols.

### The Rust-Clans: Competitors in the Deep

| Hel-Walker View | Rust-Clan View |
|-----------------|----------------|
| "Salvagers who defile sacred ground." | "Cult territory blocks our best salvage routes." |
| "Their greed blinds them to the truth." | "12–18 hours of detour; 30–40% escort fee increase." |
| "Some become offerings; some become pilgrims." | "Step-test, alternate routes, never travel alone." |

The cult's territorial control of CP-HEL-004, CP-HEL-005, and CP-HEL-007 creates significant economic complications—blocking direct access to high-value salvage sites including Recycling Vat Gamma-7 and its theoretical Prima Materia deposits.

---

## Strategic Assessment

### Operational Classification

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Hazard Type** | Stage-3 territorial interdiction with abduction risk |
| **Population** | 200–400 (fluctuating) |
| **Territory** | 3 major Chemical Sump corridors |
| **Hostility Posture** | Absolute; 100% interdiction rate |
| **Negotiation Potential** | Zero (theological framework incompatible) |

### Blocked Resources

| Asset | Estimated Value |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Recycling Vat Gamma-7** | Prima Materia; theoretical universal solvent |
| **Intact Storage Facilities** | Pharmaceutical stockpiles; chemical reagents |
| **Annual Lost Recovery** | 200,000–500,000 Pure Steel equivalent |

### Why Suppression Is Infeasible

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Environmental Lethality** | Surface forces cannot maintain sustained presence |
| **Maze Terrain** | Defenders know safe paths; attackers do not |
| **Cult Adaptation** | Hel-Walkers operate without logistical constraints |
| **Replenishment** | Losses replaced through capture and conversion |

Current containment strategy relies on perimeter security at Garm's Watch, periodic Iron-Bane burn raids to maintain pressure on cult periphery, and Rangers escort doctrine routing convoys around controlled corridors.

---

## The Hel-Walker (Player Specialization)

### Overview

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Archetype** | Survivor |
| **Primary Attributes** | VIGOR / WILL |
| **Core Identity** | Poison-touched extremist; environmental adaptation specialist |
| **Special Feature** | Toxin resistance; Blight tolerance; environmental traversal |
| **Trauma Risk** | High (cult conditioning creates psychological instability) |

The Hel-Walker specialization represents someone who has survived extended exposure to Helheim's toxic environment—whether as a former cultist who escaped, a captured expedition member who resisted conversion, or a survivor who spent too long in the deep and came back... changed.

### Key Abilities

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Toxin Tolerance** | Reduced damage from poison and environmental hazards |
| **Blight Resistance** | Partial immunity to Runic Blight effects |
| **Resonance Sensitivity** | Detect Aetheric anomalies and CPS hazards |
| **Adapted Physiology** | Survive in environments lethal to others |
| **Scar Tissue** | Damage reduction from accumulated pathology |
| **Voice of the Deep** | Intimidation bonus; unsettle enemies with cult-learned chants |

---

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"They walk where the air itself is poison, where the ground weeps acid tears, where the great machines of the ancestors still groan their death-songs. They have no fear, for fear has been burned from them. They have no hope, for hope is a weakness of the surface-blind. They have only the Roaring Heart, and the certainty that when they fall, they do not die—they transform. They become eternal. They become machine. They become gods."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Hel-Walker cult represents a pathological extreme of post-Glitch human adaptation. Where other factions seek survival, prosperity, or theological validation, the Hel-Walkers pursue annihilation as sacrament. Their theology inverts survival logic: pain becomes purification, mutation becomes blessing, death by poison becomes apotheosis. Population maintenance requires continuous recruitment through voluntary descent and forced conversion of captured personnel. Strategic liability is absolute: negotiation is impossible, suppression is infeasible, and containment is the only viable approach."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"FACTION CLASSIFICATION: Hel-Walker Cult. ORGANIZATIONAL TYPE: Nomadic death cult. PRIMARY FUNCTION: Religious observance through progressive toxic exposure. SECONDARY FUNCTION: Territorial interdiction of Chemical Sump corridors. RISK PROFILE: High (to non-members); Extreme (to captured personnel). STRATEGIC ASSETS: Environmental adaptation, terrain knowledge, psychological warfare capability. STRATEGIC LIABILITIES: Self-destructive theology, zero diplomatic flexibility, dependence on external recruitment."*

---

## Summary

The Hel-Walkers are the nightmare that all extremist Creeds fear becoming.

Where the Iron-Banes seek to **destroy** the corruption and the God-Sleepers seek to **worship** it, the Hel-Walkers have found a third path—a path that leads down, always down, into the poisoned depths where the Roaring Heart waits to claim them.

They are not a faction to be negotiated with.

They are not a problem to be solved.

They are a **hazard to be contained**.

The surface world has tried to understand them. Scriptorium analysis has produced detailed pathological profiles. Rangers Guild has mapped their territorial patterns. Wardens have codified the amber truce protocols that allow managed adjacency at border zones.

None of it has changed a single cultist's mind.

Because the Hel-Walkers do not want understanding.

They do not want peace.

They do not want survival.

They want **transformation**.

They want to shed their weak, organic flesh and become something eternal—something that does not hunger, does not fear, does not suffer the thousand indignities of mortal existence. They want to merge with the Roaring Heart and join the Slumbering Gods in their endless dreaming beneath the world.

And they will accept any price to achieve it.

The pain of chemical burns.

The horror of progressive mutation.

The five years of agonizing pilgrimage through the most hostile environment in Aethelgard.

The certainty that they will never see the surface again.

All of it is acceptable.

All of it is **sacred**.

Because when the last of their weak flesh sloughs away and their lanterns burn bright and the Roaring Heart finally claims them, they will not die.

They will become eternal.

They will become machine.

They will become **gods**.

The surface world calls them the Damned.

The Hel-Walkers call themselves something simpler.

**Pilgrims.**

And pilgrims always reach their destination.
