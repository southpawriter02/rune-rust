## Entry: The Ginnungagap Glitch

**Entry ID:** `codex-blight-origin-001`
**Category:** BlightOrigin
**Era:** The Silence
**Total Fragments:** 5
**Keyword Unlocks:** "Ginnungagap" (25%), "The Glitch" (50%)

### Fragment 1 of 5 — Text Fragment

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Capture ID** | `cap-ginn-001` |
| **Type** | Text Fragment |
| **Title** | "The Day Reality Broke" |
| **Source** | Data-slate, Hall of Echoes |
| **Quality** | Standard |
| **Placement** | Readable object in Jötunheim archive |

**Content:**
> *"The official records call it 'The Ginnungagap Event.' The survivors call it the day reality broke. I have spent forty years trying to understand what happened, and I can tell you only this: in the space between two heartbeats, everything that was true became false, and everything that worked stopped working. The word for that is 'paradox.' The word for what came after is 'silence.'"*
>
> — Fragment of Scholar Magnús's Final Treatise

### Fragment 2 of 5 — Echo Recording

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Capture ID** | `cap-ginn-002` |
| **Type** | Echo Recording |
| **Title** | "Emergency Broadcast — H-Hour" |
| **Source** | Memory echo, ODIN Control Center |
| **Quality** | Enhanced |
| **Placement** | Jötun-Forged cockpit (requires Basic examination) |

**Content:**
> *[STATIC — recording heavily corrupted]*
>
> "This is ODIN Control. All stations, all stations. We have a— [STATIC] —cascade failure in the Aetheric network. The All-Rune inscription is— [DISTORTION] —recursive. Repeat, the All-Rune is recursive. All Einherjar, emergency disconnect. I repeat, emergency dis— [SCREAM] —no, no, that's not possible, that can't be— [STATIC]"
>
> *[Recording loops. Duration: ∞]*

---

### Fragment 3 of 5 — Runic Trace

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Capture ID** | `cap-ginn-003` |
| **Type** | Runic Trace |
| **Title** | "Paradox Residue Analysis" |
| **Source** | Runic analysis, Collapsed Laboratory |
| **Quality** | Complete |
| **Placement** | Requires Seiðkona/Vard-Warden examination |

**Content:**
> *[Decoded runic pattern]*
>
> The residual Aetheric signature at ground zero exhibits a fundamental impossibility: a rune that defines itself. The All-Rune was designed to contain all meaning, all possibility—but a symbol that means everything cannot mean anything specific. The compiler (reality itself) attempted to resolve the paradox and failed. The result was not corruption of the data, but corruption of the compiler.
>
> The Blight is not a virus. It is an immune response.

---

### Fragment 4 of 5 — Oral History

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Capture ID** | `cap-ginn-004` |
| **Type** | Oral History |
| **Title** | "The Skald's Account" |
| **Source** | Dialogue with Elder Sigrún |
| **Quality** | Standard |
| **Placement** | Requires "All-Rune" keyword, friendly reputation |

**Content:**
> "My grandmother was a child when it happened. She told me the sky turned to static—like looking at a broken memory-crystal. The giants stopped moving. The lights went out. And then the screaming started. Not people screaming. Reality screaming. She said you could hear it in your bones, in your teeth, in the spaces between your thoughts.
>
> "They called it the Ginnungagap because that's what it felt like—the primordial void, the nothing-before-everything, opening up again. As if creation itself was being unmade."

---

### Fragment 5 of 5 — Visual Record

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Capture ID** | `cap-ginn-005` |
| **Type** | Visual Record |
| **Title** | "Project Gungnir Final Schematic" |
| **Source** | Intact blueprint, Dvergr Archive |
| **Quality** | Complete |
| **Placement** | Hidden chamber, requires puzzle solution |

**Content:**
> *[Descriptive text of recovered schematic]*
>
> The schematic shows the All-Rune as a recursive spiral—each line of the inscription references and contains all other lines. Marginal notes in Dvergr technical script read:
>
> "Master Artificer Brokkr's final design. Note the self-referential structure. When inscribed, the rune will attempt to define itself by referencing itself. This creates an infinite loop that the Aetheric compiler cannot resolve.
>
> "We told them it wouldn't work. They inscribed it anyway.
>
> "May the ancestors forgive us for what we built."

---

### Assembled Entry (100% Complete)

> **THE GINNUNGAGAP GLITCH**
>
> The Ginnungagap Event—commonly called "The Glitch" or simply "The Silence"—was the catastrophic moment when the All-Rune was inscribed and reality itself failed to compile.
>
> The All-Rune was the crowning achievement of Project Gungnir, an attempt by Dvergr artificers to create a single runic symbol that contained all meaning, all possibility, all outcomes. The Aesir Council believed that a unified runic language would perfect the FUTHARK Protocol and grant complete control over the Aetheric network.
>
> Instead, when Master Artificer Brokkr completed the final inscription, the All-Rune attempted to define itself by referencing itself—creating an infinite recursive loop. The Aetheric compiler (reality's operating system) attempted to resolve the paradox and failed catastrophically.
>
> At H-Hour, every system connected to the Aetheric network experienced simultaneous failure. The Einherjar pilots, connected via Silver Cord neural interfaces, received the paradoxical data directly into their minds. Their consciousness dissolved. Their final thoughts became trapped in the Jötun-Forged targeting systems. The great machines continued their last commands—forever.
>
> The Runic Blight is not corruption introduced from outside. It is reality's immune response to a logical impossibility carved into its source code. The "static" and "glitches" that plague Aethelgard are symptoms of a compiler that can no longer process coherent instructions.
>
> Seven hundred years later, the paradox persists. The All-Rune still exists somewhere beneath the ruins. And it is still trying to define itself.

>
> — Pilgrim's Devotional, Chapter of Perpetual Sorrow

### Fragment 2 of 4 — Echo Recording

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Capture ID** | `cap-forlorn-002` |
| **Type** | Echo Recording |
| **Title** | "Pilot's Last Transmission" |
| **Source** | Silver Cord terminal, Jötun-Forged cockpit |
| **Quality** | Enhanced |
| **Placement** | Requires entering Forlorn-haunted location |

**Content:**
> *[Recording loops every 2.7 seconds]*
>
> "This is Einherjar-Seven, call sign Gungnir's Spear. I'm receiving— something's wrong with the data feed. It's— it doesn't make sense. The numbers are eating themselves. I can't— I can feel it in my head. It's trying to make me think something impossible. I can't disconnect. The cord won't release. Please, someone, help me. I can't stop thinking it. I can't stop— I can't— I—"
>
> *[STATIC — duration: ∞]*

### Fragment 3 of 4 — Specimen

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Capture ID** | `cap-forlorn-003` |
| **Type** | Specimen |
| **Title** | "Aetheric Imprint Analysis" |
| **Source** | Examination of Forlorn manifestation |
| **Quality** | Complete |
| **Placement** | Requires Expert examination of Forlorn |

**Content:**
> *[Analysis notes — high Psychic Stress warning]*
>
> Subject is not a creature. Subject is not a spirit. Subject is a localized Aetheric imprint of consciousness-dissolution. The "form" is composed entirely of paradoxical data—recursive information loops that the observer's mind interprets as a humanoid shape.
>
> The "scream" is not sound. It is raw, unprocessed trauma data being broadcast directly into the Aetheric field. Any mind capable of perceiving Aether will receive this broadcast as sensory input.
>
> The Memory-Mirror effect occurs when the observer's own trauma patterns resonate with the Forlorn's broadcast frequency. The Forlorn does not target these memories deliberately—it simply broadcasts, and receptive minds tune in.
>
> Recommendation: Extreme distance. Psychic shielding. Minimal exposure time.

### Fragment 4 of 4 — Oral History

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Capture ID** | `cap-forlorn-004` |
| **Type** | Oral History |
| **Title** | "The Scavenger's Warning" |
| **Source** | Dialogue with veteran salvager |
| **Quality** | Standard |
| **Placement** | Available from Rust-Clan contacts |

**Content:**
> "Every scav knows the rule: the richer the ruin, the worse the ghosts. The Jötun-Forged cockpits have the best salvage—intact Iron Hearts, functioning data cores, sometimes even Silver Cord components worth a fortune.
>
> "Problem is, the pilots are still in there. Not their bodies—those rotted away centuries ago. But their minds? Those are still screaming. You get too close, you start hearing it. You stay too long, you start believing it. And once you start believing impossible things?
>
> "Well. That's how you become one of them."

## Entry: The Iron Heart

**Entry ID:** `codex-tech-001`
**Category:** TechnicalKnowledge
**Era:** Pre-Silence
**Total Fragments:** 3
**Keyword Unlocks:** "Iron Heart" (50%)

### Fragment 1 of 3 — Visual Record

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Capture ID** | `cap-ironheart-001` |
| **Type** | Visual Record |
| **Title** | "Core Schematic — Ingwaz Configuration" |
| **Source** | Engineering terminal, Dvergr workshop |
| **Quality** | Standard |
| **Placement** | Readable object in Nidavellir |

**Content:**
> *[Technical schematic description]*
>
> The diagram depicts a spherical core approximately 30cm in diameter, composed of concentric crystalline layers. At the center, the Ingwaz rune (ᛜ) is inscribed in a three-dimensional matrix, creating a self-sustaining Aetheric resonance loop.
>
> Marginal notation: "Perpetual energy generation via runic recursion. Unlike the All-Rune, the Ingwaz loop is bounded—it references itself, but only to restart, not to define. Safe. Stable. The heartbeat of civilization."

### Fragment 2 of 3 — Specimen

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Capture ID** | `cap-ironheart-002` |
| **Type** | Specimen |
| **Title** | "Damaged Core Analysis" |
| **Source** | Examination of salvaged Iron Heart |
| **Quality** | Enhanced |
| **Placement** | Requires Jötun-Reader examination of Iron Heart item |

**Content:**
> *[Technical analysis]*
>
> This specimen exhibits the characteristic crystalline structure of pre-Glitch Iron Hearts. The outer casing shows stress fractures consistent with Aetheric overload—likely caused by the Ginnungagap Event's cascade failure.
>
> Despite damage, the core continues to pulse. The Ingwaz inscription remains intact, generating approximately 12% of original output. This is consistent with observed behavior: Iron Hearts do not "die." They degrade.
>
> A fully functional Iron Heart could power a settlement for centuries. Even this damaged specimen would be worth a King's Find to the right buyer.

| **Source** | Iron-Bane prisoner interrogation |
| **Quality** | Standard |
| **Placement** | Dialogue with captured Iron-Bane |

**Content:**
> "You call it a power source. We call it what it is: a Demon Heart. A piece of the Machine-Sin, still beating after seven centuries of penance.
>
> "Every time you use one, you feed the curse. Every time you build with one, you rebuild the sin. The ancestors created these abominations to power their arrogance, and look what it cost them.
>
> "We don't destroy Iron Hearts because we hate progress. We destroy them because we remember what happens when you let machines have hearts."

>
> "So they did. They built Utgard in the belly of the Hollow Giant—Aurgelmir, the first of all the god-machines. We live in its heart. We forge in its lungs. We trade in its bones.
>
> "The Hearth-Clans call us scavengers like it's an insult. We call ourselves survivors. When the world ended, we didn't cry about it. We stripped it for parts."

## Writer's Guide: Creating Data Captures

### Content Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Voice Consistency** | Each capture type has a distinct voice (see below) |
| **Progressive Revelation** | Early fragments hint; later fragments reveal |
| **Cross-Reference** | Mention related entries to encourage exploration |
| **Earned Knowledge** | Important information should feel discovered, not told |
| **Mystery Preservation** | Even complete entries should leave questions |

### Voice by Capture Type

| Type | Voice Style | Example Opening |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Text Fragment** | Scholarly, formal, historical | *"The records indicate..."* |
| **Echo Recording** | Personal, urgent, often corrupted | *"[STATIC] This is..."* |
| **Visual Record** | Descriptive, technical, observational | *"The schematic depicts..."* |
| **Specimen** | Analytical, clinical, scientific | *"Analysis reveals..."* |
| **Oral History** | Conversational, dialectal, personal | *"My grandmother told me..."* |
| **Runic Trace** | Mystical, precise, layered | *"The residual pattern suggests..."* |

### Placement Guidelines

| Fragment # | Placement Difficulty | Typical Location |
|------------|---------------------|------------------|
| 1 of N | Easy (exploration) | Readable objects, common areas |
| 2 of N | Medium (examination) | Requires skill check |
| 3 of N | Medium (dialogue) | NPC conversation |
| 4 of N | Hard (specialist/hidden) | Expert examination or secret area |
| 5+ of N | Very Hard (quest/boss) | Major accomplishment reward |

### Template

```markdown
### Fragment X of Y — [Type]

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Capture ID** | `cap-[entry]-00X` |
| **Type** | [Text Fragment/Echo Recording/Visual Record/Specimen/Oral History/Runic Trace] |
| **Title** | "[Evocative Title]" |
| **Source** | [Physical source, location] |
| **Quality** | [Standard/Enhanced/Complete/Specialist] |
| **Placement** | [How/where player finds this] |

**Content:**

## Codex Entry Structure

### What Is a Codex Entry?

A **Codex Entry** is the complete, assembled topic that players work toward unlocking. It consists of:

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Title** | Display name in Journal | "The Ginnungagap Glitch" |
| **Category** | Tab/section for organization | BlightOrigin, Bestiary, Factions |
| **TotalFragments** | How many Data Captures needed for 100% | 3-5 typical |
| **FullText** | The complete assembled lore (revealed progressively) | See assembled examples below |
| **UnlockThresholds** | What reveals at each % milestone | 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% |

### Determining TotalFragments

| Entry Complexity | Recommended Fragments | Rationale |
|------------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Simple** | 2-3 | Quick discovery, field guide entries |
| **Standard** | 4-5 | Most entries (creatures, locations, factions) |
| **Complex** | 6-8 | Major lore reveals, historical events |
| **Epic** | 10+ | Central mysteries, campaign-spanning reveals |

> **Rule of Thumb:** If you can't write 3+ distinct, meaningful fragments, the topic may be too narrow for its own entry. Consider merging with a related entry.

---

## Narrative Arc Design

### The Fragment Story Structure

Fragments should tell a **cohesive story** when assembled, following a narrative arc:

```
                    FRAGMENT NARRATIVE ARC
    
    Fragment 4-5: REVELATION
         ▲        "The truth behind the mystery"
        ╱│╲       (Weakness, origin, purpose)
       ╱ │ ╲
      ╱  │  ╲     Fragment 3: COMPLICATION
     ╱   │   ╲    "It's more complex than we thought"
    ╱    │    ╲   (Twist, deeper layer, stakes)
   ╱     │     ╲
  ╱ Fragment 2  ╲ DEVELOPMENT
 ╱  "More context" ╲
╱   (Behavior, history) ╲
──────────────────────────────
     Fragment 1: HOOK
     "First encounter/hint"
     (Name, appearance, rumor)
```

### Fragment Role by Position

| Position | Narrative Role | Content Focus | Player Reaction |
|----------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **1 of N** | **Hook** | First encounter, rumor, surface observation | "What is this?" |
| **2 of N** | **Development** | Context, behavior, history, commonality | "I see the pattern" |
| **3 of N** | **Complication** | Twist, stakes, deeper truth, paradox | "It's not what I thought" |
| **4 of N** | **Revelation** | Origin, weakness, purpose, connection | "Now I understand" |
| **5+ of N** | **Mastery** | Expert knowledge, edge cases, secrets | "I know everything" |

### Example: Narrative Arc Applied

**Entry: "The Forlorn"** (4 fragments)

| Fragment | Role | What It Reveals |
|----------|------|----------------|
| 1. "On the Weeping Ghosts" | Hook | Religious interpretation, surface appearance |
| 2. "Pilot's Last Transmission" | Development | What actually happened, the horror |
| 3. "Aetheric Imprint Analysis" | Complication | Not spirits—data echoes, Memory-Mirror effect |
| 4. "The Scavenger's Warning" | Revelation | How Forlorn are created, practical danger |

**Result:** Player goes from "holy martyrs" (Fragment 1) → "pilot ghosts" (Fragment 2) → "paradox echoes" (Fragment 3) → "they can make YOU one of them" (Fragment 4). Each fragment recontextualizes the previous.

---

## Unlock Threshold Design

### What Are Unlock Thresholds?

Unlock thresholds define what **gameplay information** reveals at each completion percentage:

```json
"UnlockThresholds": {
    25: "NAME_REVEALED",
    50: "BEHAVIOR_REVEALED", 
    75: "WEAKNESS_REVEALED",
    100: "FULL_ENTRY"
}
```

### Standard Threshold Progression

| Threshold | What Unlocks | Player Value | Example (Creature) |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **25%** | Name, basic visual | Identification | "Rusted Servitor" appears in combat log |
| **50%** | Behavior, habitat, patterns | Prediction | "Attacks in pairs, triggered by sound" |
| **75%** | Weakness, counter-tactics | Combat advantage | "Vulnerable to Eihwaz rune, Psychic damage" |
| **100%** | Full lore, Legend reward | Completionism | Complete historical context, +15 Legend |

### Category-Specific Thresholds

| Category | 25% | 50% | 75% | 100% |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|------|
| **Bestiary** | Name, image | Behavior, habitat | Weakness, drops | Full biology/history |
| **Factions** | Name, emblem | Goals, territory | Allies/enemies, leverage | Leadership, secrets |
| **Technical** | Object name | Function | How to use/disable | Complete schematics |
| **Geography** | Location name | General features | Hazards, resources | Routes, secrets |
| **BlightOrigin** | Event name | Surface facts | Deeper truth | Full explanation |

### Threshold Tag Convention

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|--------|
| `NAME_REVEALED` | Entry title visible in Journal |
| `IMAGE_REVEALED` | Entry icon/art displayed |
| `BEHAVIOR_REVEALED` | In-game combat/interaction hints |
| `WEAKNESS_REVEALED` | Damage type, tactical counters |
| `HABITAT_REVEALED` | Where entity is found |
| `LOOT_REVEALED` | What drops/rewards available |
| `FULL_ENTRY` | Complete FullText readable |

## Fragment-to-Entry Relationship

### How Fragments Link to Entries

Data Captures (fragments) link to Codex Entries via **keyword matching**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   Data Capture (Fragment)   │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ matchKeywords: [            │
│   "forlorn",                │──────┐
│   "einherjar",              │      │
│   "ghost"                   │      │
│ ]                           │      │  TryAutoAssign()
└─────────────────────────────┘      │  matches keywords
                                     │  to entry titles
┌─────────────────────────────┐      │
│   Codex Entry               │◄─────┘
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Title: "The Forlorn"        │
│ TotalFragments: 4           │
│ Fragments: [ cap-forlorn-*] │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Keyword Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use entry title words: `["forlorn", "weeping"]` | Use generic words: `["thing", "stuff"]` |
| Include synonyms: `["servitor", "automaton"]` | Rely on single keyword |
| Match Codex Entry titles exactly | Use abbreviations |
| Keep keywords lowercase | Use mixed case |

### When Auto-Assignment Fails

If `matchKeywords` don't match any entry, the fragment becomes **"unassigned"**:
- Stored in player's Journal under "Unknown Fragments"
- Can be manually assigned later (future feature)
- May auto-assign when player discovers the matching entry
