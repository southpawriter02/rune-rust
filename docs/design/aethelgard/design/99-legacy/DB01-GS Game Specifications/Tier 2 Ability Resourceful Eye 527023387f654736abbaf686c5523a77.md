## Core Identity

**Resourceful Eye** trains you to spot resources where others see rubble. The subtle signs: **uncorroded metal glint, edible fungi color, water weathering patterns**. What others walk past, you recognize and harvest.

## Mechanics

### Cost

20 Stamina (out of combat) | **Once per room**

### Effect

- WITS + Wasteland Survival check (DC 12)
- Success: Reveal ALL hidden Resource Nodes in room
- Crit: Also identify quality before harvesting

### Rank Progression

| Rank | PP Cost | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 4 | DC 12, reveals hidden nodes |
| 2 | 20 | DC 10, also reveals trapped/dangerous nodes |
| 3 | 35 | Automatic success, reveals quality + best harvest method |

## Tactical Applications

**Master Scavenger:**

```
Karla uses Resourceful Eye in ruined warehouse
Check: 7d10 (WITS 3 + Survival +3 + RSR +1)
Roll: [9,8,7,7,6,4,3] = 5 successes
DC 12: SUCCESS!

HIDDEN RESOURCES REVEALED:
├─ Behind collapsed shelves: 3× [Rare Metal Scrap]
├─ Under debris pile: [Pristine Med Kit]
├─ Concealed cache: 2× [Clean Water], 5× [Rations]
└─ Secret compartment: [Masterwork Crafting Tool]
```

**Synergies:**

- **Radical Self-Reliance:** Provides bonus dice to check
- **Live off the Land:** Auto-finds herbs, this finds everything else
- **Party economy:** Found resources benefit everyone

## Failure Modes

<aside>
⚠️

**Critical Failure** — Even 7d10 pools can roll zero successes. Failure means 20 Stamina wasted + missed opportunities.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Trapped Resources** — Rank 1-2 reveal hidden nodes but NOT traps. Always do trap detection before retrieval.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Resource-Poor Environments** — Cannot create something from nothing. In looted/barren areas, 20 Stamina wasted confirming emptiness.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Time Pressure** — Out-of-combat ability requires time. During pursuit/collapse, cannot afford pause for searching.
