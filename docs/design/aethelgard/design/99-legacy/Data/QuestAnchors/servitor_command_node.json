  "Name": "[Servitor Command Node]",
  "Description": "A vast operations chamber dominated by a towering control nexus - a spire of corroded metal and pulsing Runic conduits. This was once the coordination hub for Aethelgard's automated security forces. Now it serves as the lair of a Servitor Overseer, a Draugr-Pattern unit whose patrol-loop has degraded into territorial aggression. The walls are scarred by centuries of automated defense protocols gone haywire.",
  "Archetype": "BossArena",
  "SuggestedNodeType": "Boss",
  "NarrativeText": "The Servitor Overseer has been broadcasting corrupted directives for 800 years, commanding lesser automata to 'defend' the abandoned facility from non-existent intruders. Destroying it will cripple the hostile servitor network throughout [The Roots], making deeper exploration feasible. The Overseer is heavily armored and capable of summoning reinforcements from nearby patrol routes.",
  "FlavorText": "The control nexus flickers with erratic status displays - diagnostics for systems that failed centuries ago. Servitor corpses litter the floor, cannibalized for parts by the Overseer to maintain its operational state.",
