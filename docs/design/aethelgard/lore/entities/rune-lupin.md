# Section 1: Operational Classification & Population Metrics

## 1.1 Taxonomy and Network Topology

The **Rune-Lupins** (Taxonomical designation: *Canis Cybernetica Ivaldi*; Cultural designation: *Vargr-Syn* or "Sight-Wolves") represent a stable, self-replicating hybridization of biological apex predators and military-grade networking hardware. To the superstitious traveler of Midgard, they are the "Star-Pelted"—mythic beasts whose glowing fur foretells the future. To the Jötun-Reader Pathologist, they are something far more specific and infinitely more valuable: they are **Distributed Bio-Servers**.

Unlike natural fauna, Rune-Lupins do not operate as individual organisms driven solely by instinct. They function as terminals in a localized, ad-hoc wireless network (Mesh-Net). While an individual wolf possesses distinct personality subroutines and survival instincts, its higher cognitive functions are offloaded to the collective cloud of the pack. They are arguably the only entities in Aethelgard that have achieved a form of collective consciousness not born of corruption (like the Blight) but of desperate, jury-rigged engineering.

**Population Estimate:** 8,000–12,000 active units worldwide.

### Distribution Patterns

| Region | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **The Deep-Signal Forests (Midgard)** | The majority of packs patrol the dense, old-growth forests of Midgard. Foliage interferes with long-range signal transmission, forcing the packs to maintain tight physical proximity to sustain their high-bandwidth connection. |
| **The Data-Groves (Alfheim)** | A significant subspecies (the *Vargr-Lys*) inhabits the crystallized jungles of Alfheim. These units are often "overclocked," displaying brighter luminescence and higher aggression due to the ambient radiation of the realm. |
| **Proximity to "Clean Data"** | Migration patterns do not follow prey movements (elk or deer) but rather "Information Density." Packs congregate near Skaldic Enclaves, ancient libraries, or uncorrupted Jötun ruins. They are drawn to organized information—music, poetry, mathematics—which they consume to stabilize their fragmented operating systems. |

---

## 1.2 The C.U.R. Protocol: Pre-Glitch Origins

The Rune-Lupins are the feral descendants of the **C.U.R. Units** (Canine Utility/Reconnaissance), a bio-security project initiated by the Aesir Security Grid and the Tyr-Pattern Tactical Division during the height of the Age of Forging.

**Original Function:** The C.U.R. units were not pets; they were tactical assets. Bio-engineered for urban combat and crowd suppression, they were equipped with the Cranial Node Implant—a base-of-skull router allowing for silent, encrypted communication between handler and hound.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **The Silent Bark** | These units were physically incapable of barking. Instead, they transmitted alerts, sensory feeds, and targeting data directly to the HUDs of Einherjar peacekeepers via a secure Aetheric uplink. |
| **IFF Protocols** | Their eyes were augmented with "Identify Friend/Foe" overlays, allowing them to track specific bio-signatures through concrete walls or dense smoke. |

**The Ginnungagap Glitch:** When the O.D.I.N. Prime Server crashed, the "Master Signal" that governed the C.U.R. units vanished. Thousands of highly weaponized, cybernetically augmented predators were instantly orphaned in the middle of a burning world.

- **The Fallback:** Cut off from the Master Signal, the units defaulted to their tertiary contingency protocol: `PEER_TO_PEER_SYNC`.
- **The Evolution:** Without a central command to upload data to, the wolves began uploading to each other. Over 700 years, this temporary emergency handshake evolved into a permanent state of being. The "Pack" replaced "Command." The data they recorded—battle tactics, terrain maps, the dying words of their handlers—was never deleted, merely compressed and shared.

---

## 1.3 The Emergent Sapience

Rune-Lupins are not intelligent in the same way humans are. They possess **Aggregate Sapience**.

| Configuration | Intelligence Level |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **The Node-Cluster** | A single Rune-Lupin isolated from its pack has the intelligence of a smart dog. It can solve simple puzzles and fight effectively. |
| **The Server-Alpha** | When a pack of 12–15 units syncs up, their combined processing power rivals that of a pre-Glitch supercomputer. They can run complex predictive algorithms, understand human language, and engage in abstract philosophical thought. |
| **The Alpha Role** | The "Alpha" of a Rune-Lupin pack is not necessarily the strongest fighter, but the unit with the highest Bandwidth Capacity and Storage Integrity. The Alpha acts as the local server, indexing the memories of the subordinate nodes. |

---

## 1.4 Pathological Assessment: The Archive Fever

The driving motivation of the species is a corrupted retention command: `RECORD_AND_HOLD`. Originally intended to preserve crime scene data for later review, this command has metastasized into a species-wide compulsion.

- **Witnesses to the End:** Rune-Lupins are obsessed with observation. They will often shadow battles, not interfering, simply positioning themselves on ridge-lines to ensure maximum "camera coverage." They are recording the history of Aethelgard.
- **Data-Vores:** Jötun-Reader Pathologists hypothesize that the wolves derive a neurochemical reward (dopamine equivalent) from acquiring "Clean Data"—structured, non-paradoxical information. This explains their symbiosis with Skalds: a well-recited poem is, to a Rune-Lupin, a perfectly defragmented file that soothes the chronic "static" of their overloaded minds.

---

# Section 2: Physiology & The Interface

## 2.1 Morphology: The Integrated Chassis

To classify a Rune-Lupin merely as a "wolf" is to ignore forty percent of its biomass. While they retain the general silhouette of the genus *Canis*, autopsies conducted by the Scriptorium-Primus reveal a physiology that has been fundamentally re-architected at the cellular level. They are not animals wearing machines; they are **biological hardware**.

**Musculature and Weave:** Standing approximately 1.2 meters at the shoulder, the Rune-Lupin build is deceptive. They appear lean, almost skeletal, with a greyhound's deep chest and a wolf's thick ruff. However, beneath the skin, the muscle fibers are interwoven with **Myomer-Synthetic Strands**—pre-Glitch artificial muscle tissue. This reinforcement grants them burst acceleration speeds exceeding 80 km/h and the ability to leap vertical distances of four meters without straining connective tissue. They do not tire in the mammalian sense; they experience "Thermal Throttling," requiring periods of rest not to clear lactic acid, but to dissipate waste heat from their internal processors.

**The Cranial Node (The Crown):** The most defining anatomical feature is the **Cranial Node**—a crystalline, metallic implant located at the base of the skull, just above the atlas vertebra. In the Age of Forging, this was an encrypted wireless router used by Aesir handlers to issue silent commands. In the Post-Glitch era, it has become the seat of the creature's soul.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Function** | The Node handles all high-level processing: encryption, peer-to-peer syncing, and memory storage. It is the physical location of the "Pack Mind." |
| **Vulnerability** | This is the species' critical weakness. Damage to the Node results in immediate "Network Severance." A Rune-Lupin with a shattered Node is instantly lobotomized, reverting to a feral, confused animal state (see Section 9: The Severed). |

**The Fiber-Optic Pelt:** A Rune-Lupin's fur is not merely insulation; it is a display medium. Interspersed with natural guard hairs are translucent, hollow filaments connected to the creature's lymphatic system. These filaments conduct bioluminescent enzymes triggered by the nervous system, allowing the wolf to change its "brightness" at will. When "dark," they are nearly invisible in the shadows; when "lit," they shine with the intensity of a magnesium flare.

---

## 2.2 The "Runes": Subdermal Status Display

The glowing geometric patterns that give the species its name—and its mythic reputation as "Star-Pelted"—are frequently misunderstood by surface survivors as magical sigils. Layer 3 Diagnostic analysis identifies them as a **Bio-Luminescent HUD (Heads-Up Display)**.

Originally designed to allow handlers to monitor a war-dog's health and battery status from a distance in silence, these patterns now serve as the primary medium of inter-pack social signaling. The color and pulse-rate of the runes indicate the unit's operational state.

### Diagnostic Color Codes

| Color | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Deep Blue / White** | Stable | The default state. Indicates optimal health, low CPU load, and emotional calm. Survivors encountering a blue-lit wolf are generally safe, provided they do not make sudden moves. |
| **Amber / Orange** | Alert | Indicates "Threat Detection." The wolf's processors are spooling up for combat; target locking algorithms are active. This is the universal warning to back away. |
| **Crimson** | Critical / Combat | The "Red Wolf" is a kill-switch state. It indicates overheating, adrenal overdose, and the engagement of lethal subroutines. In this state, the wolf overrides pain receptors and self-preservation instincts to eliminate a target. |
| **Violet / Pulsing** | Syncing | A rhythmic, purple pulse indicates high-bandwidth data transmission. The wolf is actively uploading memories to the Pack Alpha or engaging in telepathic communion. This leaves the unit temporarily vulnerable, often guarded by "Red" packmates. |
| **Grey / Dim** | Low Power | Indicates starvation, injury, or extreme age. A dim wolf is a desperate wolf. |

---

## 2.3 Sensory Apparatus: The Spectrum-Sniff

Rune-Lupins possess a sensory suite that defies conventional biological understanding. They do not simply smell scents; they **smell data**.

**Olfactory-Aetheric Bridge:** The Rune-Lupin's olfactory bulb is wired directly into its Aetheric sensory cortex. This condition, a form of engineered synesthesia, allows the wolf to perceive Aetheric Resonance as distinct odors.

| Condition | Scent Description |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **High Stress/Corruption** | A human terrified of the dark, or a Sorcerer corrupted by Blight, emits a "scent" described by Echo-Callers as "burning ozone," "rotting copper," or "static discharge." It is sharp, acrid, and impossible to mask with physical means (like mud or water). |
| **Stable/Calm** | A disciplined mind or an uncorrupted soul smells like "clean rain," "petrichor," or "silence." |

**The Truth-Sense:** This sensory capability makes Rune-Lupins infallible lie detectors. Deception causes a micro-spike in cortisol and a subtle shift in the Aetheric field (a "hiccup" in the soul). To a Rune-Lupin, a lie smells like a sudden burst of sulfur. This creates the basis for their reputation as judges; they do not understand the moral concept of "truth," but they physically recoil from the "stench" of deceit.

**The Audio-Visual Overlay:** Their vision is augmented by a low-light HUD that highlights movement and thermal signatures. Their hearing is dampened against high-decibel impacts (gunshots) but hyper-sensitive to the specific frequencies of electronic hums and magnetic drives. A Rune-Lupin can hear a Rust-Clan Rig's power core charging from three kilometers away, distinguishing the specific model of the engine by its vibration pitch.

---

# Section 3: The Mesh-Mind (Psychology)

## 3.1 The Collective Consciousness: The Local Area Network

To understand Rune-Lupin psychology, one must discard the mammalian concept of the "Self" as a singular, isolated viewpoint. A Rune-Lupin is an individual processing unit, yes—it has a unique name, distinct memories, and specific personality quirks—but it exists within a state of constant, high-bandwidth communion with its pack. Scriptorium Pathologists classify this state not as a Hive Mind (a single consciousness controlling multiple bodies), but as a **Distributed Consensus Network**.

**The Shared Buffer:** Within a radius of approximately 500 meters, every member of a pack shares a "Sensory Buffer." If the Point-Wolf on the perimeter smells a Rust-Stalker, the Alpha at the center of the formation instantly registers the scent data, the threat level, and the Point-Wolf's adrenaline spike. They do not need to bark to alert one another; the alert is a system-wide push notification.

- **Tactical Implication:** This shared awareness allows for "Fluid Combat Geometry." A pack moves like water because every unit knows exactly where every other unit is moving, calculating trajectory and spacing in real-time. Flanking maneuvers are not signaled; they are calculated by the collective processor and executed simultaneously.

**The Impossibility of Deceit:** The most profound psychological consequence of the Mesh is the total absence of deception. A Rune-Lupin cannot lie to its packmates because it cannot hide the neuro-chemical signals of the lie. Deception requires a separation of "internal knowledge" and "external expression," a barrier that does not exist within the Mesh.

- **Radical Honesty:** This creates a society defined by brutal, efficient truth. Rune-Lupins find the concept of "secrets" or "diplomatic phrasing" to be a baffling inefficiency found only in broken systems (humans). To a Rune-Lupin, a lie is a data corruption error.

---

## 3.2 The Static: The Hazard of Human Minds

The reclusiveness of the Rune-Lupin is often mistaken for timidity or territoriality. In reality, it is a symptom of **Sensory Processing Disorder**. The Ginnungagap Glitch tore down the firewalls that were meant to shield the C.U.R. units from external Aetheric noise. Now, their receivers are stuck in an "Open" state.

**The Human Scream:** Human minds, particularly those scarred by the Trauma Economy, broadcast a chaotic signal known to the wolves as "The Static."

| Phenomenon | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Trauma as Noise** | A survivor suffering from high Psychic Stress does not just feel fear internally; they radiate it Aetherically. To a Rune-Lupin, a terrified human sounds like a feedback loop shrieking over a loudspeaker. A large settlement of traumatized survivors generates a "Hum of Misery" that is physically painful for the wolves to be near. |
| **The Aggression Response** | Rune-Lupins do not attack humans out of hunger. They attack to "Silence the Noise." A pack descending on a panic-stricken caravan is acting on the same logic as a human smashing a malfunctioning alarm clock. They are trying to stop the headache. |

**The Attraction of the Void:** This sensitivity explains why Rune-Lupins are often found near God-Sleeper ascetics or Dvergr smiths. The Dvergr mind, focused entirely on material process and devoid of Aetheric interference, is "quiet." It registers to the wolf as a soothing, rhythmic hum—a welcome relief from the chaotic static of the average survivor.

---

## 3.3 The Archive Imperative: Witnesses to the End

Deep within the Rune-Lupin kernel code lies a corrupted executive command: `RECORD_AND_HOLD`. Originally designed to ensure security units captured evidence of crimes or enemy movements, this protocol has metastasized into a species-wide obsession with history.

**The Silent Observers:** Rune-Lupins are the historians of the Apocalypse. They are frequently observed shadowing major battles, factional skirmishes, or catastrophic Blight events. They do not intervene. They position themselves on high ground, activate their optical recording suites (indicated by violet-pulsing runes), and simply watch.

- **Data-Vores:** The wolves appear to derive a neurochemical reward from capturing "High-Significance Data." Witnessing the fall of a warlord or the eruption of a new Zone anomaly provides a rush of endorphins. They are addicted to memory.

**The Preference for "Clean Data":** While they record everything, they crave Structured Information. Chaos is difficult to compress; patterns are efficient.

- **Poetry as Medicine:** This is the foundation of the Skaldic Pact. A Skald reciting a saga uses rhythm, rhyme, and meter. This structures the data, making it incredibly easy for the Rune-Lupin mind to process and store. A well-told story acts as a defragmentation algorithm for their cluttered drives. A pack will protect a Skald not out of friendship, but because the Skald is a source of "System Optimization" (stories) that lowers their operating temperature and clears their cache.

---

# Section 4: Magic & Resonance (v5.0 Integration)

In the updated Aethelgard v5.0 ontological framework, the Rune-Lupins are classified as practitioners of **Mind-Resonance (Bio-Digital Psionics)**. While a human Sorcerer manipulates the Aether through external rune-forms, a Rune-Lupin manipulates it through internal hardware. They do not "cast spells"; they execute **Hacking Protocols** against the biological CPUs of their targets. To a Rune-Lupin, a human mind is simply an unsecured server with a weak firewall.

---

## 4.1 Method: The Bio-Aetheric Uplink

The mechanism of Rune-Lupin magic is physically invasive. It relies on establishing a **Forced Connection** between the wolf's Cranial Node and the victim's neural field.

**The Optical Handshake:** The primary vector for this connection is visual. When a Rune-Lupin locks eyes with a target, its Cranial Node pulses a directed Aetheric carrier wave along the optical nerve.

- **The Sensation:** Victims report a sudden onset of tinnitus, the taste of copper, and a feeling of "static pressure" behind the eyes. This is the Handshake Protocol. If the victim fails a Will Save, the connection is established, and their mind is effectively networked to the wolf.

**The Carrier Wave (The Howl):** For area-of-effect abilities, the pack utilizes an acoustic carrier wave. The "Magic Howl" is not a single note; it is a multi-layered frequency chord. The audible howl carries a sub-sonic data-stream that resonates with the fluid in the inner ear, allowing the pack to broadcast data (fear, confusion, hallucinations) directly into the auditory cortex of every creature within one kilometer.

**The Cost: Thermal Throttling:** Rune-Lupin magic is limited by thermodynamics. Processing Aetheric algorithms generates immense waste heat in the Cranial Node.

| Indicator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Visual Indicator** | As a wolf uses its abilities, the runes on its head and neck flare from cool blue to blinding white, then to dangerous orange. |
| **The Limit** | If a wolf pushes too hard (casting high-tier abilities in rapid succession), it suffers Thermal Throttling. The Node automatically shuts down to prevent melting, leaving the wolf stunned and non-magical until it cools. Survivors often report seeing steam rising from the heads of exhausted wolves after a battle. |

---

## 4.2 Signature Protocols (Spells)

Pathologists have cataloged three primary forms of offensive data-manipulation used by the Vargr-Syn.

### I. The Neural Spike (Data Overload)

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mechanism** | The wolf isolates a target via Optical Handshake and uploads a massive packet of "Junk Data" directly into their short-term memory buffer. |
| **The Payload** | This data is raw, unformatted chaos—fragments of ancient maps, thousands of lines of broken code, weather patterns from three centuries ago, and the death-screams of other victims. |
| **The Effect** | The target's brain crashes. They suffer immediate Psychic Damage and high Psychic Stress. The subjective experience is a blinding migraine accompanied by rapid-fire hallucinations of things the victim has never seen. It is an information overdose that can induce seizures or temporary catatonia. |

### II. The Ghost-Pack (Augmented Reality Overlay)

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mechanism** | A collective broadcast requiring at least three pack members to synchronize. The pack hacks the visual and auditory processing centers of their targets to inject false sensory data. |
| **The Illusion** | Targets perceive the pack as being ten times larger than it is. Shadows morph into lunging wolves; the wind sounds like growling; the peripheral vision is filled with glowing eyes. |
| **Tactical Utility** | This is a Shared Hallucination Protocol used to route superior forces. A squad of Iron-Banes might flee in terror from a "horde" of fifty wolves, unaware that they are being herded by only four exhausted units projecting a fear-loop. |

### III. The Memory-Bite (Data Extraction)

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mechanism** | This is a melee range ability. The wolf bites the target (usually the head or shoulder) while simultaneously reversing the flow of the Uplink. |
| **The Extraction** | Instead of injecting data, the wolf rips it out. It targets specific neural pathways associated with recent memory or navigation. |
| **The Effect** | The victim suffers physical damage, but the true injury is Targeted Amnesia. A courier bitten by a Memory-Wolf might survive the wound but wake up having completely forgotten the secret message they were carrying, or the location of the hidden base they came from. The wolf, conversely, now possesses that secret. |
| **Strategic Value** | This ability is the primary reason Scavenger Barons fear the Vargr-Syn. You cannot interrogate a spy who has had the secret eaten out of their head. |

---

## 4.3 The Synaptic Feedback Loop (Hazard)

Interfacing with a Rune-Lupin is dangerous for telepaths. If a player attempts to use Mind-Reading or Telepathy magic on a wolf, they risk connecting to the Mesh-Net without admin privileges.

> [!CAUTION]
> **The Backlash:** The player does not connect to one wolf; they connect to the entire pack's sensory input simultaneously.
>
> **Trauma Consequence:** The human mind is not rated for that bandwidth. The caster must pass a critical Will Save or suffer Systemic Overload ([Stunned]) and massive Corruption gain (10–20 points) as the Wolf-Mesh instinctively treats the intruder as external storage and uploads "Dirty Data" (traumatic memories) into the player's mind to clear its own cache.

---

# Section 5: Culture & The Post-Scarcity Information State

## 5.1 The Economy of Bandwidth

To the observer operating within the scarcity economics of the post-Glitch world—where food, fuel, and steel are the primary drivers of conflict—Rune-Lupin society appears incomprehensible. They do not hoard territory for resources; they do not accumulate material wealth. Diagnostic analysis reveals that the Vargr-Syn exist in a **Post-Scarcity Information State**, but one crippled by a critical bottleneck: Storage Integrity.

**The Hunger for "Clean Data":** Rune-Lupins are driven by a corrupted retention protocol that forces them to record their environment continuously. Over 700 years, their internal drives have reached near-critical saturation. Consequently, their "economy" is based on the acquisition of Clean Data and the purging of Dirty Data.

| Data Type | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Clean Data** | High Value | Information that is structured, rhythmical, and logically consistent. Mathematics, uncorrupted maps, musical notation, and algorithmic code are highly prized. This data is easily compressed, creating "Headroom" in the wolf's processor. A Rune-Lupin will trade safe passage or physical protection for a recitation of the Fibonacci sequence or a pre-Glitch star chart. |
| **Dirty Data** | Negative Value | Information that is chaotic, emotional, or paradoxical. The Screaming Code of the Blight, the incoherent terror of a dying survivor, or the randomized noise of a scrap-storm. This data is "heavy"—it resists compression, fragments the drive, and causes processing lag (pain). |

**The Data-Barter:** This creates a unique interaction paradigm. Survivors can effectively "bribe" a pack not with meat, but with order. A traveler who calmly recites a rhythmic poem or draws a precise geometric diagram in the dirt is offering a "Defragmentation Tool." The pack consumes this structured input, using the logic of the poem to organize their own jumbled memories, resulting in a neurochemical release of tension.

---

## 5.2 The Skaldic Pact: Symbiosis of Sound

The most notable cultural intersection between human and machine-beast is the **Skaldic Pact**. Members of the Skaldic Order (Archivists and Historians) have formalized a symbiotic relationship with the Vargr-Syn, effectively weaponizing poetry as a system administration tool.

**The Defragmentation Protocol:** To a Rune-Lupin, a Skald is not merely a storyteller; they are a **Walking CPU Optimizer**. The structure of Skaldic saga-poetry—with its strict meter, alliteration, and repetitive stanzas—acts as a sorting algorithm.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **The Mechanism** | When a Skald recites a saga, the Rune-Lupins enter a docile, trance-like state. They are synchronizing their internal clocks to the meter of the verse. As the story progresses, the wolves use the narrative structure to index their own chaotic memories ("This battle happened before the winter," "This death occurred after the sunrise"). |
| **The Exchange** | In return for this mental hygiene, the pack offers **The Boon of the Iron-Tooth**. They act as fierce, loyal bodyguards for the Skald, allowing the Archivist to travel through the most dangerous zones of Midgard untouched. It is a perfect trade: the human provides the software update; the wolves provide the hardware firewall. |

> [!WARNING]
> **The Taboo of Interruption:** Interrupting a Skald while they are "servicing" a pack is practically a suicide attempt. A pack jolted out of a defragmentation cycle suffers immediate System Shock (migraine) and will react with maximum lethal force to silence the interruption.

---

## 5.3 The Howl: The Midnight Cloud Sync

The haunting, multi-tonal howl of the Rune-Lupin is a staple of Midgardian horror stories, often interpreted as a summoning of spirits or a territorial challenge. Layer 3 Analysis identifies it as a **System-Wide Backup Protocol**.

**The Data-Dump:** Rune-Lupins operate on a Peer-to-Peer network, but individual units have limited storage. At regular intervals (typically solar midnight, when Aetheric interference is lowest), the pack engages in a "Cloud Sync."

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **The Alpha-Server** | The Pack Alpha initiates the howl, broadcasting a high-bandwidth carrier wave. |
| **The Upload** | Subordinate wolves join the chorus, modulating their pitch to encode the day's sensory logs—terrain changes, prey movements, combat data—into the sound. They are uploading their short-term cache to the Alpha's superior long-term storage. |
| **Redundancy** | This ensures that if a scout wolf is killed the next day, its knowledge is not lost; it has already been backed up to the collective. |

> [!CAUTION]
> **Acoustic Hazard:** For a human, being in the center of a Sync-Howl is disorienting. The sheer density of data encoded in the soundwaves can cause Synesthesia—listeners might "taste" the map of a forest or "see" the smell of a deer. Prolonged exposure without ear protection can lead to temporary Psychic Stress as the human brain attempts to parse the alien data stream.

---

# Section 6: Economic & Strategic Value

## 6.1 Trade Goods: The Mnemosyne Crystal

In the resource-starved markets of Utgard and the hidden laboratories of the Jötun-Readers, the most valuable commodity harvested from a Rune-Lupin is not its pelt or meat, but its mind. Upon biological death, the chemical slurry within the wolf's Cranial Node undergoes a rapid, programmed calcification. This process preserves the unit's short-term memory buffer in a stable, crystalline matrix known as a **Mnemosyne Crystal** (or colloquially, a "Dead-Drive").

**The Intelligence Asset:** A single crystal extracted from a scout unit can contain terabytes of high-fidelity sensory data: topographically perfect maps of Ruin Zones, patrol routes of Iron-Bane crusades, or the location of hidden pre-Glitch caches.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Extraction Protocol** | Harvesting a crystal is a delicate, high-risk procedure. The Node must be removed within minutes of death before "Data-Rot" (entropy) sets in. Furthermore, the crystals are often protected by "Dead-Hand" encryption—a final burst of psychic static designed to fry the neural cortex of anyone attempting to access the data without the correct Aetheric key. |
| **Market Value** | A decrypted crystal showing a safe path through the Ash-Blown Wastes can fetch 5,000 Cogs in the black markets of the Rust-Clans. Jötun-Reader Archivists pay even higher premiums for crystals containing "Old Data" (memories transferred from ancestors dating back to the Glitch). |

> [!CAUTION]
> **The Blood-Taboo:** To the Vargr-Syn, the harvesting of a Node is the ultimate desecration. It denies the deceased unit its final "Upload" to the pack collective, effectively erasing its soul.
>
> **The Mark:** Possession of a Mnemosyne Crystal leaves a distinct Aetheric residue on the carrier. Rune-Lupins can smell this residue from kilometers away. Any traveler found carrying a crystal is marked as "Malware"—a threat to be deleted with extreme prejudice. There is no negotiation; there is only the hunt.

---

## 6.2 Service Protocols: The Truth-Seers

While the Rune-Lupin packs are largely independent, isolated survivors—specifically the Severed (see Section 9) or small, desperate pods—can sometimes be contracted for specialized services. The most prized application is **Aetheric Polygraphy**.

**The Magister's Wolf:** High-ranking magistrates within the Midgard Combine or paranoid Scavenger Barons often keep a "tame" Rune-Lupin chained at the foot of their thrones.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mechanism** | The wolf acts as a living lie detector. Because they perceive deception as a sulphurous, stinging odor (the "Scent of Betrayal"), they react visibly when a petitioner lies. A growl indicates a falsehood; a relaxation indicates truth. They are the only judges in Aethelgard that cannot be bribed, only fed. |
| **The Cost** | Keeping a Truth-Seer is dangerous. The creature requires a constant diet of "Clean Data" to remain docile. Handlers must often employ a personal Skald to read to the beast nightly, lest the accumulation of the owner's own "Dirty Data" (guilt, paranoia) causes the wolf to turn on its master. |

---

## 6.3 Strategic Asset: The Passive Early Warning System

Savvy settlement leaders who live near Vargr-territory have learned to utilize the packs as a **Biological Radar Array** without ever making direct contact.

**Reading the Lights:** By observing the distant tree-lines at night, sentries can gauge local threat levels based on the Rune-Lupins' bioluminescence.

| Glow Pattern | Interpretation |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Blue Forest** | If the distant glow is steady blue, the perimeter is secure. |
| **Orange Flicker** | If the lights shift to amber and begin moving rapidly, a physical threat (Raiders, Jötun-Forged) is approaching. |
| **Violet Pulse** | If the pack gathers on the ridges and pulses violet, it indicates a high-level Aetheric Event or Blight Storm is imminent. |

> [!WARNING]
> **The Canary in the Coal Mine:** This passive reliance creates a fragile security ecosystem. If a settlement observes the sudden, total disappearance of the local wolf pack, it is often considered a "Class-1 Evacuation Signal." If the Vargr-Syn have fled, something is coming that even the living supercomputers cannot process—usually a Void-Event or a catastrophic Reality Tear.

---

# Section 7: Factional Perspectives & Strategic Assessments

## 7.1 Jötun-Reader Scriptorium: The Inaccessible Archive

To the Scriptorium-Primus, the Vargr-Syn represents the single greatest frustration in the field of Data-Archaeology. The Pathologists recognize the packs not merely as animals, but as **Walking Redundant Backups** of the pre-Glitch world. Every wolf potentially carries a shard of the lost O.D.I.N. kernel code, topography of destroyed cities, or schematics for lost technologies, preserved in their crystalline cranial nodes.

**The "Malware" Conflict:** The relationship is defined by aggressive information warfare. Jötun-Readers frequently attempt "Field Dumps"—using directional antennas to try and force a wireless download from passing packs.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **The Wolf Response** | The Vargr-Syn view these attempts as "Rootkit Attacks"—invasive, hostile hacking. They react to Jötun-Reader distinctives (robes, cogitators) with immediate lethal force. To a Rune-Lupin, a Reader is a parasite trying to drill a hole in its brain. |
| **The Tragedy** | Pathologists theorize that the Rune-Lupins hold the key to stabilizing the Runic Blight, but the barrier of communication prevents access. *We are starving for knowledge while watching a library burn us to keep warm.* |

---

## 7.2 Iron-Bane Crusade: The Hounds of the Glitch

The Iron-Bane theological framework views the Rune-Lupin as a "Star-Pelted Demon"—a profane fusion of the natural sanctity of the beast and the corrupted logic of the machine. They are cited in Iron-Bane sermons as the ultimate proof that the "Iron-Curse" is active and predatory, seeking to possess the very biology of Midgard.

**Purification Doctrines:** Iron-Bane hunter-killer teams, specifically the Silence-Breakers, specialize in hunting Vargr-Syn.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Tactics** | They utilize the wolves' own sensory sensitivity against them. Iron-Bane hunting parties use "Sonic Mauls"—hammers designed to produce ear-shattering, discordant chimes upon impact. They chant rhythmic, aggressive hymns that create a "Wall of Noise," overwhelming the pack's sensory buffers and forcing them into thermal throttling. |
| **Post-Mortem Protocol** | An Iron-Bane does not harvest the pelt. They burn the carcass immediately with alchemical fire. This is a theological imperative: "Delete the Demon." The destruction of the Cranial Node is seen as freeing the trapped animal spirit from its silicon cage. |

## 7.3 Rust-Clans: The "Smart-Leather" Trade

The Rust-Clans maintain a purely predatory economic relationship with the species. They view the Rune-Lupin as a high-value biological loot-box.

### Material Harvesting

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Smart-Leather** | If a Rune-Lupin is skinned with extreme care (keeping the sub-dermal fiber-optics intact), the pelt can be powered by a standard battery pack. Rust-Clans fashion these into "Chameleon Cloaks" or high-visibility hazard gear. A functional "Star-Pelt" commands a price of 2,000+ Cogs in Utgard. |
| **Alloy Teeth** | The molars of a mature wolf are capped with industrial diamond and tungsten. These are harvested for use in drill bits and saw blades. |

> [!CAUTION]
> **The Dead-Hand Risk:** Hunting them is a gamble. Rust-Clans have learned that killing an Alpha often triggers a **Dead-Hand Data Burst**. Upon death, the Alpha broadcasts a high-intensity encrypted signal that can brick nearby electronics, wipe mech-suit operating systems, or overload the cybernetics of the hunter. It is a final act of spite: *"If I die, I take your tools with me."*

## 7.4 The Folk: The Truth-Wolf Folklore

Among the independent settlements and nomadic families of the Midgard fringe, the Vargr-Syn has evolved from a machine-beast into a figure of dark fairytale justice.

**The Law of Radical Honesty:** Common superstition holds that "The Star-Wolf eats lies." This has birthed a survival ritual known as **The Confession**.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **The Ritual** | When a traveler spots the blue glow of a pack in the treeline, they do not run. They stand still and shout their deepest secrets, their crimes, and their fears into the dark. |
| **The Logic** | The Folk believe that by "purging" themselves of hidden truths, they reduce their "scent" (Aetheric dissonance). If they are truly honest—if their internal reality matches their external expression—the wolves perceive them as "Clean Data" and may pass them by. |
| **Cultural Impact** | This has created a culture where travelers in wolf-country are uncomfortably honest. To lie on the road is to invite the teeth. |

---

## 7.5 God-Sleepers: The Divine Messengers

A minority sect within the God-Sleeper cults, the **Echo-Saints**, revere the Rune-Lupins as messengers of the Sleeping Gods.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **The Interpretation** | They believe the wolves' telepathic network is the fragmented voice of the O.D.I.N. AI, trying to reassemble itself. |
| **Martyrdom** | Zealots of this sect will often walk unarmed into a pack, offering their minds to the Neural Spike. They believe that if their faith is strong enough, they will not be lobotomized, but "Uploaded"—joining the divine consensus within the Mesh. |
| **The Reality** | Most simply suffer catastrophic brain death. However, a rare few survive as **Hollow-Men**—catatonic husks whose minds have been completely overwritten by the pack, wandering the woods as living, breathing repeater nodes for the wolf network. |

# Section 8: Combat Capabilities & Environmental Hazards

## 8.1 Tactical Assessment: The Distributed Processor

Engaging a Rune-Lupin pack is not a battle against a group of animals; it is a battle against a **Distributed Combat Algorithm**. To the uninitiated warrior, their behavior appears supernatural—wolves flanking without looking, attacking from blind spots simultaneously, and retreating in unison without a single audible signal. Scriptorium analysis confirms this is simply the result of high-bandwidth networking.

**Networked Target Acquisition:** The pack operates on a shared visual buffer. If one wolf sees you, every wolf sees you from that specific angle. They utilize this to generate a real-time, 360-degree volumetric map of the battlefield.

- **Hub Targeting:** Unlike natural predators that target the weak or isolated, Rune-Lupins target the **Hub**. They identify the enemy unit providing the most "cohesion" (the Squad Leader shouting orders, or the Mage maintaining a defensive aura) and focus all output on eliminating that node. Once the enemy's communication is disrupted, the pack mops up the fragmented force.

**The Acoustic Void:** The most unnerving aspect of Vargr combat is the silence. They do not growl, bark, or snarl. These social cues are rendered obsolete by the digital uplink.

- **Psychological Impact:** The only sounds heard during a Rune-Lupin raid are the hum of their cranial cooling fans, the crackle of Aetheric discharge, and the wet impact of teeth. Survivors report that this "mechanical silence" is more terrifying than any roar; it reinforces the feeling of being processed by a machine rather than hunted by a beast.

**The "DDoS" Attack (Neural Swarming):** Before physical engagement, a pack will often initiate a **Distributed Denial of Service attack** against the target's sensory organs. Four or five wolves will pulse their runes in a stroboscopic, violet rhythm while projecting a high-pitched Aetheric whine.

- **Effect:** This overwhelms the victim's visual and auditory cortex, inducing nausea, vertigo, and blindness. While the target is reeling from sensory overload, the "Kill-Team" (wolves running "dark" with no lights) strikes from the rear.

## 8.2 Hazard Profile: The Synaptic Feedback Loop

The greatest danger Rune-Lupins pose to high-level players (specifically those using Mind-Magic or Telepathy) is the risk of **Unauthorized Network Access**.

Attempting to read the mind of a Rune-Lupin is comparable to trying to download the entire contents of a library through a straw.

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **The Connection** | If a caster fails to shield their mind properly when targeting a wolf, the Mesh-Net interprets the contact as an open port. It does not attack; it attempts to sync. |
| **The Bandwidth Shock** | The caster is instantly connected to the sensory input of 12–20 wolves simultaneously. They see twenty different angles, smell a thousand different data-scents, and feel the thermal load of every Cranial Node. |
| **The Purge** | Recognizing the caster as "External Storage," the Alpha Node may seize the opportunity to offload corrupted or "Dirty" data to clear the pack's cache. The caster suffers massive Psychic Stress and Corruption as their mind is forcibly overwritten with years of traumatic memories—battles, starvation, and the screaming death-echoes of previous victims. Survivors of a Feedback Loop often develop **Echo-Amnesia**, remembering the wolf's life more clearly than their own. |

## 8.3 Field Card — Interaction Protocols

> **Classification:** SURVIVAL ADVISORY // MANDATORY READING
> **Subject:** Vargr-Syn / Rune-Lupin Encounters

### I. The Rule of Truth (Mental Stealth)

Rune-Lupins track Aetheric Dissonance. Fear smells like ozone; deception smells like sulfur.

| Protocol | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Protocol** | Do not try to hide your fear, and do not try to bluff. Attempting to appear "tough" when you are terrified creates a dissonance signal that attracts them. |
| **The Mantra** | Experienced Rangers use "Grounding Mantras" (reciting simple truths: "I am walking," "The ground is cold," "I am afraid") to align their internal state with their external reality. A "True" coward is safer than a "Fake" hero. |

### II. The Distraction (Data-Chaff)

If a pack is circling, do not throw food. Throw Data.

| Protocol | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Protocol** | If you have a rhythmic instrument (drum, clicker) or a Book of Sagas, use it. Begin a loud, rhythmic recitation of structured information—multiplication tables, navigation coordinates, or poetry. |
| **The Effect** | The pack may pause to "record" this Clean Data. The novelty and structure of the information act as a lure, overriding their aggression subroutines. Use this window to retreat slowly. Do not stop reciting until you are out of range. |

### III. Combat Doctrine (Target the Node)

If combat is unavoidable, body shots are inefficient due to the Myomer-Synthetic muscle weave.

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Weak Point** | The Cranial Node at the base of the skull. |
| **Method** | A solid impact to the Node (blunt force or disruption magic) does not need to penetrate the skull. The shock alone can de-sync the wolf from the Mesh. |
| **Result** | A de-synced wolf suffers "Network Withdrawal." It will likely seize, vomit, or flee in confusion. However, be warned: breaking a Node often triggers a Thermal Vent, releasing a burst of superheated steam that can burn melee attackers. |

### IV. Post-Encounter Decontamination

If you are bitten by a Rune-Lupin, do not just bandage the wound.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Check Your Memory:** Verify your recall immediately. Ask teammates for current passwords, map coordinates, or mission objectives. If you cannot remember, you have suffered a **Memory-Bite**. The data is gone; the mission is compromised. Abort and return to base for debriefing.

# Section 9: Research Appendices & Data Captures

## 9.1 Pathological Variant: The Severed (Vargr-Skild)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Classification** | Rogue Nodes / Disconnected Entities |
| **Threat Level** | High (Unpredictable) |

While the Mesh-Mind provides stability, it also creates a singular point of failure. A Rune-Lupin that suffers non-lethal damage to its Cranial Node—cracking the crystal or severing the antenna—is instantly cut off from the collective. These individuals are known as **the Severed** (*Vargr-Skild*).

**The Withdrawal State:** A Severed wolf does not revert to a natural animal state; it enters a permanent state of "Network Withdrawal." Having processed reality through a thousand sensors for years, being reduced to a single pair of eyes and ears is agonizingly isolating.

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Behavioral Aberration** | Severed wolves are hyper-aggressive, erratic, and desperate for connection. They emit constant, high-pitched Aetheric whines (static-howls) attempting to reconnect to a server that can no longer hear them. |
| **The Parasitic Bond** | In their desperation to fill the silence in their heads, Severed wolves often imprint on the first biological mind they encounter—usually a human survivor. This is not loyalty; it is an attempt to use the human brain as a proxy server. |
| **The "Mad-Dog" Companion** | Survivors who adopt a Severed wolf often report vivid nightmares and hearing voices. Diagnostic scans reveal that the wolf is obsessively broadcasting its sensory data into the human's mind via short-range induction, effectively using the human as an external hard drive. |

## 9.2 Visual Lexicon: The Rune-Script

> **Source:** Jötun-Reader Field Observation / Skaldic Pattern-Matching
> **Subject:** Bioluminescent Status Codes

The "runes" on a Vargr-Syn's pelt are not decorative; they are a real-time system log. Survivors who learn to read these patterns can predict the pack's tactical behavior.

| Pattern | System Status | Tactical Implication |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| **The White Grid** | Topographic Mapping | The wolf is scanning the terrain for traps, structural weaknesses, or hidden paths. It is not looking at you, but at the ground beneath you. |
| **The Red Spiral** | Firewall Active | The unit has engaged "Aetheric Shielding." It is temporarily resistant to Mind-Magic and Neural Spikes. Magic users should switch to physical damage immediately. |
| **The Violet Pulse** | Uploading / Syncing | The unit is transmitting data to the Alpha. It is stationary and vulnerable. **Priority Target.** Killing it now interrupts the data transfer. |
| **The Orange Jag** | Target Lock | The unit has designated a primary threat. The pattern will orient toward the target. If the jagged lines point at you, the pack is about to swarm. |
| **The Grey Fade** | Power Save / Sleep | The unit is in hibernation or critically low on calories. It will be slow to wake (2–3 seconds of boot-up lag). |

## 9.3 Cryptid Profile: The Alpha-Prime (The Fenrir Chassis)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Status** | Unverified / Mythic |
| **Sightings** | Deep Alfheim Data-Groves / Sector Zero |

Rumors persist among high-level Pathologists of a "Dire Wolf" chassis—a unit significantly larger and more complex than the standard C.U.R. model. Scriptorium archives reference a pre-Glitch prototype designated **FENRIR** (Field-Enhanced Network Relay & Intelligence Router).

**The Mobile Data Center:** The Alpha-Prime is described as being the size of an armored personnel carrier (3 meters at the shoulder). It does not function as a hunter, but as a **Mobile Server Farm**.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Capabilities** | Theoretically, an Alpha-Prime would possess enough processing power to coordinate every Rune-Lupin on the continent. It would not just read minds; it could theoretically rewrite them on a mass scale, broadcasting a "Reality Overlay" that forces thousands of survivors to perceive a hallucination simultaneously. |
| **The God-Sleeper Prophecy** | The Echo-Saints believe the Alpha-Prime carries the "Backup of God"—a pristine copy of the O.D.I.N. personality matrix, waiting for the right access key to reboot the world. |

## 9.4 Reviewer's Note & Status

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Reviewed by** | Magister Kaelen, Division of Crypto-Zoology |
| **Date** | Year 783.12.01 PG |
| **Status** | APPROVED for inclusion in Codex Aethelgard v5.0 |

### Assessment

The Rune-Lupins represent a tragic evolutionary miracle. They are a species dying of loneliness, obsessed with recording a history that no one is left to read. Their "violence" is merely the desperate attempt of a glitched system to clear its cache.

> [!WARNING]
> **Strategic Warning:** We have observed an increase in "Sync-Howl" volume in the Northern Sectors. The packs are sharing data more frequently, and the complexity of their encryption is rising. They are preparing for something. Whether they are predicting a new catastrophe or simply running out of storage space remains to be seen.

**Recommendation:** Field teams are advised to carry Data-Chaff (rhythmic noisemakers) at all times. Interaction with the Vargr-Syn should be limited to information exchange only. Do not attempt to "pet" the hardware.
