# Domain 7: Reality Rules Validation Check

**Domain ID:** `DOM-7`
**Severity:** P1-CRITICAL
**Applies To:** All narrative content, ability specs, status effects, hazard documentation, world lore

---

## Canonical Ground Truth

Reality in this setting is fundamentally unstable due to the Ginnungagap Glitch. Contradictions create paradoxes with real consequences.

### Core Mechanics

**Paradox:**
- Reality contradictions that shouldn't coexist
- Observable phenomena that break logical consistency
- Accumulative exposure causes cognitive/physical damage
- Cannot be "solved"—only avoided or endured

**CPS (Cognitive Paradox Syndrome):**
- Progressive condition from paradox exposure
- Symptoms: headaches, perception distortion, intrusive thoughts
- Advanced stages: personality fragmentation, reality disconnection
- **No cure exists**—only management and prevention

**Runic Blight:**
- Corrupted Aether spreading paradox contamination
- Propagates through inscriptions and Aetheric connections
- Corrupts functional systems into paradox states
- **No cure exists**—containment only

**Ginnungagap Glitch Effects:**
- Ongoing reality substrate corruption (not one-time event)
- Systems behave contradictorily
- Deterministic logic breaks down
- Continuous background instability

### Key Constraint

> The setting's metaphysical problems are **fundamentally unsolvable**. There is no cure for CPS, no way to cleanse Blight, no restoration of pre-Glitch stability. Stories exist within this constraint, not in defiance of it.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Paradox mechanics consistent with canonical rules?
- [ ] CPS accumulation follows established progression?
- [ ] CPS presented as irreversible (no magical cures)?
- [ ] Data-Wraith manifestations use canonical mechanics?
- [ ] Blight corruption spread follows established patterns?
- [ ] Blight presented as containable, not curable?
- [ ] Ginnungagap Glitch effects appropriately described?
- [ ] No deus ex machina solutions to paradox problems?
- [ ] Reality instability ongoing (not resolved)?
- [ ] Supernatural effects grounded in paradox/Aetheric mechanics?

## Common Violations

| Pattern | Example | Why It Fails |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Paradox "cures" | "The healer cleansed the paradox corruption" | No cure exists |
| CPS recovery | "After rest, her CPS symptoms faded" | CPS is progressive, irreversible |
| Easy Blight containment | "They purified the Blighted area" | Blight cannot be purified |
| Reality restoration | "The Glitch effects were reversed" | Glitch damage is permanent |
| Unexplained supernatural | "Magic happened" | Must be Aetheric/paradox grounded |
| Contradiction without consequence | "Time flowed backwards, then fixed itself" | Paradoxes have lasting effects |

---

## Green Flags

- CPS as progressive, irreversible condition
- Blight as persistent, containable-only threat
- Paradox exposure creates lasting consequences
- Reality instability as ongoing background condition
- No easy solutions to metaphysical problems
- Characters adapting to/coping with reality damage, not fixing it

---

## Remediation Strategies

### Option 1: Remove False Solutions

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "The Runasmidr cured her CPS" | "The Runasmidr taught her techniques to manage the symptoms—but the damage was done, permanent" |
| "They cleansed the Blight" | "They established containment wards, slowing the spread, though the corruption remained" |
| "The paradox was resolved" | "The paradox stabilized into a persistent anomaly, dangerous but predictable" |

### Option 2: Shift to Coping/Management

Frame solutions as management, not cure:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "healed from paradox exposure" | "learned to function despite the creeping distortions" |
| "the Blight was defeated" | "the Blight was contained, walled off, its advance halted for now" |
| "reality returned to normal" | "the worst instabilities passed, leaving behind a new, scarred equilibrium" |

### Option 3: Add Consequence

If content shows recovery, add lasting cost:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "She recovered from CPS" | "The acute symptoms faded, but she would never again trust her own perceptions. Some nights, she still wasn't sure which memories were hers." |

### Option 4: Ground Supernatural Effects

All supernatural phenomena need Aetheric/paradox explanation:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "The ghost appeared" | "The Data-Wraith manifested, a paradox echo of someone long dead, drawn to the Aetheric disturbance" |
| "Strange powers awakened" | "Exposure to corrupted Aether had changed something—her perceptions now extended into frequencies that shouldn't exist" |

## Decision Tree

```
Does the content involve paradox/CPS/Blight/reality effects?
├── NO → PASS (not applicable)
├── YES → Does anyone "cure" or "fix" these effects?
│   ├── YES → FAIL (Domain 7 violation - false solution)
│   └── NO → Are effects managed/contained rather than eliminated?
│       ├── YES → Are there lasting consequences?
│       │   ├── YES → PASS
│       │   └── NO → FLAG (may need consequence addition)
│       └── NO → Is this showing progressive damage/decline?
│           ├── YES → PASS (appropriate trajectory)
│           └── NO → Review for implicit recovery
```

## CPS Progression Reference

When validating CPS depictions:

| Stage | Symptoms | Reversibility |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Early | Headaches, minor perception issues | Manageable but permanent |
| Moderate | Intrusive thoughts, reality questioning | Significant impairment, permanent |
| Advanced | Personality fragmentation, hallucinations | Severe impairment, permanent |
| Terminal | Complete disconnection from reality | Irreversible, often fatal |

**Key Point:** Characters can stabilize at any stage but cannot reverse progression.

---

## Blight Containment Reference

When validating Blight depictions:

| Action | Appropriate | Inappropriate |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Warding | Creates barriers, slows spread | "Prevents all Blight" |
| Containment | Isolates affected areas | "Eliminates Blight" |
| Dispersal | Scatters concentration | "Cleanses Blight" |
| Avoidance | Staying away from sources | N/A |

**Key Point:** All Blight responses are defensive/reactive, never curative.

## Examples

### PASS Example

**Content:** "Three years of paradox exposure had left its mark. Kara could function—could still read the dying systems, still interpret the contradictory data—but she no longer trusted her own memories. Which version of yesterday was real? She'd stopped asking. The headaches were constant now, a background hum she'd learned to work through. There was no going back. There was only forward, for however long she had left."

**Why:** Shows CPS as permanent, progressive, manageable but not curable. Character adapts without recovering.

### FAIL Example

**Content:** "The ancient Galdr purified her mind, washing away the paradox corruption. She felt whole again, cleansed of the Glitch-taint."

**Violations:**
- "purified" implies cure (impossible)
- "washing away" implies elimination (impossible)
- "whole again" implies full recovery (impossible)
- "cleansed" implies removal (impossible)

**Remediation:** "The ancient Galdr created a moment of clarity, a brief respite from the paradox static. But the corruption remained, woven into her neurons now. She felt better—functional, even—but not whole. Never whole again."

### FAIL Example

**Content:** "The Blight was driven back, the land healed, and the survivors rebuilt on ground that was once again safe."

**Violations:**
- "driven back" (Blight advances, doesn't retreat)
- "land healed" (no healing possible)
- "once again safe" (implies restoration to pre-Blight state)

**Remediation:** "The Blight's advance was arrested—warded, contained, though never truly stopped. The survivors built their new settlement at the edge of the quarantine zone, on ground that was merely less dangerous. Nothing was safe. Nothing had been safe for seven hundred years."
