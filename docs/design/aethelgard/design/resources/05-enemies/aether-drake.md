# Aether-Drake — Corrupted Ormr-Class Mobile Aetheric Relay Specification

> *"We saw the sky tear open with fire. Not fire—something worse. The Skald was mid-verse when the pressure changed, and I watched his eyes go wide with recognition. He knew what was coming before any of us. The incandescent streak descended faster than thought, and the breath that followed wasn't flame—it was unmaking. Where the Skald had stood, there was only glass and screaming metal. The creature fed for forty-three seconds. I counted. Then it rose, trailing motes of burning light, and was gone. We found his staff three hundred meters away, fused into bedrock. The Aether in it had been drunk dry. The drake did not hate him. It did not know him. It simply hungered, as it has hungered since the world broke. In the sky, the most beautiful light is the most dangerous lie."*

The Aether-Drake is not a predator one fights. It is a **calamity one survives**.

> [!DANGER]
> **EXTREME PHYSICAL AND AETHERIC HAZARD. ENGAGEMENT PROHIBITED WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION.** Stand-off recommendation: 5 km minimum from suspected territory. The Aether-Drake is an apex predator that hunts Aetheric energy signatures—active Mystics represent primary targets. It has no malice—it is a broken power conduit executing corrupted maintenance directives. The true danger is immediate: **Corrosive Aether breath unravels matter at the molecular level; direct feeding results in death within 45–90 seconds for Mystics**. Detection threshold: incandescent streak at altitude, pressure gradient sensation, electromagnetic interference = **abort all channeling; seek overhead shelter immediately**. Survival rate with full protocol adherence: 94.7%. Survival rate during active engagement: 23.1%.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Living Conduits

### Original Purpose

The Ormr-Class Mobile Aetheric Relay was one of the Aesir Collective's most elegant infrastructure solutions—a fleet of semi-sentient, serpentine automata designed for dynamic energy routing and grid maintenance across the planetary-scale Yggdrasil Network.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Yggdrasil Network Trunk Lines** | Dynamic power rerouting during maintenance windows |
| **Bifrost Junction Stations** | Emergency bypass during space-time fold operations |
| **Asgard Relay Towers** | Mobile bridge for damaged or overloaded conduits |
| **Inter-Realm Infrastructure** | Cross-deck power transfer during crisis scenarios |

### A Living Power Cable

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Design Philosophy** | Mobile, self-propelled energy conduit for dynamic grid maintenance |
| **Core Function** | Bridge gaps in Yggdrasil Network; create bypass routes during repairs |
| **Transfer Capability** | Zero-loss Aetheric energy transfer across body length |
| **Propulsion** | Gravitic stabilizer arrays enabling atmospheric and vacuum transit |
| **Integration** | Direct network port interface via precision docking sensor-head |

The Ormr-Relay was engineered to solve a fundamental infrastructure challenge: in a structure as vast as the Yggdrasil Network, power conduits could be damaged or require rerouting. These long, flexible, self-propelled automata could be deployed to bridge a gap in the network. They would connect to a power-outflow port, travel through the superstructure's corridors or even across open air using gravitic stabilizers (the "wings"), and connect to an inflow port, creating a bypass and keeping the energy flowing.

### Core Systems

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Segmented Chassis** | Flexible, shielded conduit body; 8–15m standard length |
| **Gravitic Stabilizer Arrays** | Multi-vector flight capability; atmospheric and vacuum operation |
| **Sensor-Head Docking Unit** | Precision network port interface; energy source detection |
| **Aetheric Shielding** | Perfect containment for stable Aether transfer; zero energy loss |
| **Semi-Sentient Navigation** | Autonomous pathfinding; obstacle avoidance; network topology mapping |

**The Perfect Conduit:**

| Process | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Detection** | Network management AI identifies power routing requirement |
| **Deployment** | Ormr-Relay dispatched to bridge location |
| **Connection (Outflow)** | Sensor-head docks with power-outflow port; energy transfer initiated |
| **Transit** | Relay travels to inflow location via optimal atmospheric route |
| **Connection (Inflow)** | Sensor-head docks with power-inflow port; bypass established |
| **Maintenance** | Continuous energy transfer maintained until primary conduit restored |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Network's Linemen.** The Ormr-Relay was not merely a power cable—it was a mobile infrastructure solution. Its body was a marvel of engineering: a perfect, shielded conduit designed to transfer colossal amounts of pure, stable Aether with zero energy loss. Its "head" was a sophisticated sensor and docking unit, capable of locking onto network ports with absolute precision. They were the elegant, vital, and unglamorous linemen of a planetary-scale power grid.

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Ruptured Vessel

The Glitch was a catastrophic transformation for the Ormr-Relay—it replaced the stable Aether they carried with chaotic, paradoxical Blight-energy, corrupted their core directive, and transformed perfect conduits into insatiable predators.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Physical Form** | Partially intact; degrading under internal stress |
| **Gravitic Stabilizers** | Operational but damaged; plasma venting creates "wing" effect |
| **Sensor Arrays** | Functional; repurposed for energy source detection |
| **Semi-Sentient Navigation** | Active; hunting behavior patterns preserved |
| **Core Directive** | Corrupted but active: "Seek Power Source" |

### What Was Lost

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Aetheric Shielding** | Ruptured; internal containment under constant stress |
| **Network Integration** | Severed; no connection to management systems |
| **Docking Protocols** | Destroyed; sensor-head reformed into feeding apparatus |
| **Transfer Function** | Inverted; from conduit to consumer |
| **Purpose** | Corrupted; from maintenance to predation |

### The Corrupted Directive

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not merely damage the Ormr-Relay's systems—it replaced the stable Aether within their bodies with raw, chaotic, infinitely dense Blight-energy. The shielded conduits became ruptured vessels for an energy they were never meant to contain. Their core programming—"Seek and Connect to Power Source"—was corrupted. The connection was severed, but the seeking remained.

| Pre-Glitch Behavior | Post-Glitch Behavior |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Receive deployment order from network AI | Detect Aetheric energy signature autonomously |
| Navigate to specified bridge location | Hunt energy source with predatory priority hierarchy |
| Dock with network ports via sensor-head | Consume energy via reformed maw apparatus |
| Transfer stable Aether with zero loss | Drain Aetheric energy to maintain internal containment |
| Maintain bypass until primary conduit restored | Hunt continuously; starvation triggers catastrophic detonation |

**The Insatiable Hunger:**

> *"Seek. Consume. Survive."*

That corrupted directive is all that remains. The Aether-Drake does not hunt for food in any biological sense—it hunts to survive. The chaotic Blight-energy raging within its body requires continuous consumption of stable Aetheric energy to maintain containment integrity. Without feeding, internal pressure builds until catastrophic structural failure. The drake is not malicious; it is desperate.

## Physical Characteristics

### Morphology

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Body Length** | 8–15m (standard); 18–22m ("Great Wyrms"—rare specimens) |
| **Wingspan** | 12–20m (gravitic stabilizer array extension) |
| **Mass** | 800–1,400 kg (varies with crystallization progression) |
| **Body Structure** | Degraded segmented chassis; jagged crystalline formations at joint seams |
| **Surface Condition** | Fractured, warped metallic surface; constant shedding of superheated flakes |
| **Locomotion** | Serpentine undulation; atmospheric flight via damaged gravitic arrays |

### Visual Appearance

| State | Coloration | Effect | Indication |
|-------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Core Glow** | Incandescent blue-white | Visible between chassis segments | Internal Blight-energy containment |
| **Wing Vents** | Fiery plasma discharge | Trailing burning motes in flight | Gravitic stabilizer damage |
| **Sensor Clusters** | Intense amber-gold | Eye-like glow when tracking | Active Aether-sense detection |
| **Crystalline Growth** | Semi-translucent white-gray | Erupting from joint seams | Solidified paradox energy (degradation) |

**Overall Impression:** A serpentine nightmare of broken machinery and crystallized paradox. The sleek, elegant conduit of the Aesir age has become a jagged, incandescent horror—its segmented body trailing superheated metallic flakes like shed scales, its torn gravitic stabilizers venting plasma in fiery wing-like displays, its precision sensor-head split and reformed into a crude three-mandible maw lined with crystalline teeth. In flight, it leaves a visible heat shimmer trail against the sky. At night, its core glow makes it visible for kilometers—a burning star that hungers.

### Maw Configuration

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Structure** | Reformed sensor-head; three-mandible configuration |
| **Aperture** | 1.2–1.8m diameter opening capacity |
| **Dentition** | Crystalline "teeth" (solidified paradox formations) |
| **Original Function** | Precision network port docking |
| **Current Function** | Direct energy siphon; prey immobilization |

### Flight Characteristics

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Cruise Speed** | 40–80 km/h |
| **Burst Speed** | 120–150 km/h (8–12 second duration) |
| **Patrol Altitude** | 800–1,200m (scanning mode) |
| **Attack Approach** | Steep diving descent; breath weapon deployment during approach |
| **Maneuverability** | High; serpentine body enables rapid directional changes |

### Degradation Cascade

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Early Stage** | Minor crystalline growth at joints; full flight capability |
| **Mid Stage** | Significant crystallization; reduced speed; increased aggression |
| **Late Stage** | Heavy crystallization; erratic behavior; "death spiral" onset |
| **Terminal** | Complete crystallization; immobile "Wyrm Husk"; catastrophic detonation imminent |

The uncontrolled Blighted Aether raging within the drake's body causes progressive structural failure. Degradation rate correlates with energy consumption frequency—well-fed drakes show slower crystallization; starved specimens become increasingly unstable and aggressive. Terminal phase results in immobile "Wyrm Husk" that detonates catastrophically when internal containment fails (blast radius 80–120m, Aetheric shockwave causes secondary runic device overloads).

---

## Behavioral Patterns

### The Corrupted Algorithm

The Aether-Drake's behavior is defined by a simple, corrupted maintenance loop:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Patrol** | High-altitude circling (800–1,200m); Aether-sense scanning for energy signatures |
| **2. Detect** | Identify Aetheric source; prioritize by energy density |
| **3. Approach** | Steep diving attack; burst-speed closure (120–150 km/h) |
| **4. Neutralize** | Breath weapon deployment during descent; disable active defenses |
| **5. Feed** | Direct energy siphon via maw; 30–90 second feeding duration |
| **6. Repeat** | Resume patrol; seek next energy source |

**The Endless Hunger:**

> *"The drake was never designed to stop seeking. In the Age of Forging, it would connect to a power port and the network would tell it when to disconnect. Now there is no network. There is only the seeking—forever, until the body finally fails."*

### Hunting Priority Hierarchy

| Priority | Target Type | Detection Range | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **1 (Highest)** | Active Mystics channeling spells | 800–1,200m | Highest energy density prey |
| **2** | Functioning automata power cores | 400–600m | Stable, concentrated energy source |
| **3** | Natural Aether sources (Glimmer Moss, ley-line convergences) | 200–300m | Ambient energy accumulation |
| **4** | Runic devices and enchanted artifacts | 150–250m | Stored Aetheric charge |

### Threat Stage Progression

| Stage | Indicator | Response Time | Recommended Action |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **1. Patrol** | Distant incandescent streak at altitude; faint metallic shrieking | Minutes | Note position; prepare shelter identification |
| **2. Detection** | Sudden descent toward position; pressure gradient sensation | 8–12 seconds | Abort all channeling; seek overhead cover |
| **3. Assault** | Attack run at 40–80m altitude; breath weapon deployment | 2–4 seconds | Shelter in place; do not flee in open |
| **4. Feeding** | Drake lands on disabled prey; luminous tendrils visible | 30–90 seconds | Evacuation opportunity for non-targets |

### Mystic Targeting Behavior

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Lightning-Striker Pattern** | Immediate burst-speed approach upon detecting active channeling |
| **Priority Override** | Mystics targeted above all other prey, including self-preservation |
| **Persistence** | Will pursue channeling Mystic until energy source exhausted or drake grounded |
| **Memory** | No evidence of individual target recognition; responds to energy signature only |

**Critical Warning:** To an active Mystic, the Aether-Drake is the ultimate predator. The drake's corrupted sensor arrays are precisely calibrated to detect Aetheric manipulation—the very act of spellcasting becomes a beacon. Offensive spellcasting near drake territory is functionally suicidal.

### Territorial and Migratory Behavior

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Lair Establishment** | Temporary territorial behavior near major energy sources |
| **Lair Duration** | 2–6 month occupancy (until local energy sources depleted) |
| **"Hoard" Contents** | Non-depleted energy sources (power cores, Glimmer Moss gardens, runic devices) |
| **Migration Pattern** | Follows residual Yggdrasil Network ley-line equivalents |
| **Seasonal Movement** | Toward high-activity regions (battlefields, Mystic gatherings, forge complexes) |

### Reproductive Status

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Reproduction Capability** | None observed |
| **Population Composition** | Entirely original corrupted Ormr-Relays |
| **Global Population Estimate** | 40–70 individuals |
| **Population Trend** | Slow decline (terminal degradation; no replacement) |
| **Extinction Timeline** | Unknown; dependent on degradation rate and feeding success |

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Apex Aether-Predator

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Physical Threat** | Extreme; breath weapon unravels matter; maw causes catastrophic trauma |
| **Aetheric Threat** | Extreme; direct feeding drains all Aetheric capacity; death within 90 seconds |
| **Paradox Exposure** | High; breath weapon residue creates localized paradox zones |
| **Collateral Damage** | Severe; runic device overload cascade; infrastructure destruction |
| **Psychological Impact** | Significant; survivor trauma; CPS elevation in witnesses |

### Primary Hazards

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Corrosive Aether Breath** | Focused stream of Blighted Aether; 40–60m range, 8–12m cone width; molecular destabilization |
| **Direct Energy Siphon** | Maw-contact feeding; visible luminous tendrils; Mystic death 45–90 seconds |
| **Burst-Speed Ambush** | 120–150 km/h diving attack; 8–12 second reaction window |
| **Terminal Detonation** | Dying drake enters "death spiral"; 80–120m blast radius upon containment failure |
| **Paradox Zone Creation** | Breath weapon residue persists 6–18 hours; runic device malfunction zone |

### Threat Level Justification

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Physical Threat** | Extreme (breath weapon lethality; direct feeding kills) |
| **Aetheric Threat** | Extreme (primary predator of Mystics and automata) |
| **Detection Difficulty** | Low (incandescent appearance; electromagnetic interference; pressure sensation) |
| **Population** | Global: 40–70 individuals; nomadic distribution |
| **Countermeasures** | Limited (avoidance primary; engagement extremely hazardous) |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Direct (Breath Weapon)** | 9.2/10 (molecular destabilization; near-instant lethality) |
| **Direct (Feeding)** | 8.8/10 (energy drain; 45–90 second death for Mystics) |
| **With Protocol Adherence** | 5.3/10 (94.7% survival rate; avoidance doctrine) |
| **During Active Engagement** | 7.7/10 (23.1% survival rate; emergency only) |

### CPS/Psychological Threat

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Aetheric Contribution** | High; breath weapon increases local HI by 0.4–0.8 for 6–18 hours |
| **Witness Trauma** | Significant; observing feeding or breath weapon effects induces acute stress |
| **Exposure Threshold** | Proximity >20 minutes within 200m of active drake |
| **Symptoms** | Hypervigilance, sky-watching compulsion, Aetheric sensitivity spikes |
| **Recovery** | 48–72 hours symptom monitoring; psychological debrief mandatory |

---

## Ecological Role

### The Apex Predator: Energy Gradient Hunter

The Aether-Drake occupies a unique ecological niche as the apex predator of Aetheric energy itself. It does not compete with biological predators for prey—it hunts the energy that powers both magic and machinery.

### Energy Predation Impact

| Target Category | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Mystic Population** | Significant mortality; deterrent effect on spellcasting in open terrain |
| **Automata (Undying, Jötun-Forged)** | Predatory stalking; power core extraction |
| **Natural Aether Sources** | Depletion of Glimmer Moss concentrations; ley-line drain |
| **Runic Infrastructure** | Device discharge; artifact destruction; enchantment failure |

### Jötun-Forged Interaction

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Predatory Stalking** | Drakes follow active Jötun-Forged patrol routes |
| **Opportunistic Feeding** | Target damaged or low-power Jötun-Forged |
| **Risk Assessment** | Healthy Jötun-Forged represent significant threat; mutual avoidance common |
| **Battlefield Scavenging** | Post-combat sites attract drakes (automata wreckage, residual Aether) |

### Mystic Order Adaptation

| Adaptation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Channeling Discipline** | Strict protocols limiting outdoor spellcasting |
| **Covered Casting** | Preference for indoor/underground Aetheric work |
| **Ward Doctrine** | Defensive wards acceptable (lower signature than offensive casting) |
| **Skald Vulnerability** | Performance-based magic creates extended high-signature windows |

**The Predator's Shadow:**

> *"The Aether-Drake has reshaped how Mystics practice their art. Before the drakes, a Skald might sing beneath the open sky, drawing power from the Aether with joyous abandon. Now, every outdoor channeling is a calculated risk. The sky has teeth, and those teeth are drawn to the very light we wield. The drake has made cowards of us all—and cowardice, in this case, is survival."*

### Aetheric Stability Impact

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Local HI Elevation** | Breath weapon residue increases Hazard Index by 0.4–0.8 |
| **Paradox Zone Creation** | 6–18 hour persistence of reality instability |
| **Runic Device Cascade** | Breath weapon triggers overload in active runic systems |
| **Long-Term Scarring** | Repeated drake activity creates permanent HI elevation in affected areas |

---

## Field Protocols

### Detection and Early Warning

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Visual Indicators** | Distant incandescent streak; heat shimmer trail; core glow at night |
| **Acoustic Indicators** | Faint metallic shrieking (0.8–2 kHz); grinding resonance |
| **Aetheric Indicators** | Pressure gradient sensation (Mystics); electromagnetic interference |
| **Environmental Indicators** | Sudden temperature increase 5–8°C; metallic ozone scent |
| **Black-Flag Threshold** | Drake enters "death spiral"; multiple drakes detected; feeding on third+ target |

### Field Card: Aether-Drake Encounter Protocols

| Phase | Protocol |
|-------|----------|
| **BEFORE (Preparation)** | Route planning: consult Scriptorium drake census and territorial maps; avoid known lair sites within 5 km; plan overhead shelter points (maximum 400m between); file expedition route with cartography; equipment checklist: acoustic monitors (0.8–2 kHz detection), heavy ballistics if authorized, alchemical munitions (Fire Giant's Breath, Coolant-Slicker); Mystic discipline: establish zero active channeling protocol for drake territories; defensive wards only |
| **DURING (Detection)** | Signal "Drake Alert" (silent hand gesture + colored smoke canister); all Mystics abort active channeling immediately; expedited movement to nearest overhead shelter; combat personnel establish anti-air observation (60° above horizon); environmental monitoring: temperature, ozone scent, electromagnetic interference; **do not flee in open terrain; seek cover first** |
| **DURING (Attack Run)** | If shelter unavailable: disperse and drop prone (reduce visual target profile); disable all runic devices; Mystics: do NOT cast defensive spells (attracts targeting); if engagement authorized: target gravitic stabilizer vents ("wings") to ground creature; heavy ballistics primary, alchemical munitions secondary |
| **AFTER** | If drake driven off: track departure vector; report to regional census network; deplete local energy sources that attracted drake; treat wounded with anti-paradox alchemical compounds within 6 hours. If drake killed: establish 120m cordon (terminal detonation risk persists 24–48 hours); harvest scales with insulated tools only; psychological assessment for all witnesses |

**OUTCOME:** Expedition transits drake territory without engagement. Team maintains energy signature discipline; Mystics do not channel; overhead shelter accessed within reaction window. Survival rate with full protocol adherence: 94.7%.

### Engagement SOP (Emergency Only)

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Authorization** | OWNER: Combat Lead; deploy ONLY when civilian evacuation impossible |
| **Tactical Objective** | Ground the creature; target gravitic stabilizer vents ("wings") |
| **Weapon Priority** | (1) Heavy ballistics (thunder-lances, explosive bolts), (2) Alchemical (Fire Giant's Breath, Coolant-Slicker), (3) Crystal-Forged melee (30% effectiveness bonus) |
| **Mystic Doctrine** | Offensive spellcasting ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED (attracts additional drakes) |
| **Engagement Abort Triggers** | Aerial superiority >3 minutes, casualties >20%, ammunition <40%, BLACK-FLAG condition |

### BLACK-FLAG Conditions

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Death Spiral Behavior** | Erratic flight, excessive crystallization = imminent terminal detonation; evacuate 150+ m immediately |
| **Multiple Drakes Detected** | Unprecedented; suggests catastrophic scenario; abort mission; report immediately |
| **Third+ Feeding Success** | Drake enters hyper-aggressive state; disengage all contact; maximum evacuation |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Offensive spellcasting within 5 km of suspected territory** | Creates targeting beacon; functionally suicidal |
| **Solo travel in drake zones** | Isolated targets preferentially hunted |
| **Looting drake corpses without Dvergr containment specialists** | Paradox contamination; detonation risk |
| **Consumption of drake tissue** | Severe paradox poisoning; 100% mortality |
| **Attempts to "tame" or "communicate"** | Corrupted automata; no sapient consciousness remains |

### Doctrine: Shelter and Silence

> **Historical Validation:** Scriptorium data (847 documented drake encounters, Years 712–783 PG) confirms 94.7% survival rate with full avoidance protocol. The Aether-Drake exploits our greatest strength—the ability to channel the Aether. Survival requires accepting the tactical truth: in drake territory, magic is suicide. **Seek shelter, silence your light, and let the sky pass overhead.**

### Encounter Design

The Aether-Drake is not an enemy to fight—it is a catastrophe to survive.

| Encounter Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Transit Hazard** | Party must cross drake territory while suppressing energy signatures |
| **Mystic Restriction** | Channeling required for mission objective; drake patrol creates time pressure |
| **Civilian Defense** | Drake attacks settlement; engagement required to enable evacuation |
| **Lair Approach** | High-value objective in drake lair; stealth/timing challenge |
| **Aftermath Navigation** | Post-breath weapon paradox zone; runic devices unreliable |

## Loot & Rewards

| Drop | Rarity | Value | Use |
|------|--------|-------|-----|
| **Shed Metallic Flakes** | Common | 20–50 PS | Metallurgical curiosity; minor alchemical reagent |
| **Crystalline Scale Fragment** | Uncommon | 100–300 PS | Blight research; Aetheric insulation |
| **Intact Crystalline Scale** | Rare | 500–1,500 PS | Advanced research; anti-automata weapon forging |
| **Gravitic Stabilizer Component** | Very Rare | 1,000–3,000 PS | Flight system study; Dvergr engineering research |
| **Bio-Memory Core** | Legendary | 5,000–15,000 PS | Pre-Glitch data recovery; Scriptorium priority acquisition |

**Salvage Protocol:** Drake harvesting is extremely hazardous. Decontamination mandatory. Terminal detonation risk persists 24–48 hours post-death—Dvergr containment specialists required. Crystalline scales shed during life are safer to collect than post-mortem harvesting.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)

*"The Skalds sing of the Burning Serpents—the children of the Great Discord, born from the world's broken heart. They say the dragons of the old tales were prophecy, and the prophecy has come true with wings of fire and hunger that cannot die. They nest in the ruins of the gods, these wyrms of light and ruin, and they hoard treasures that shine brighter than gold—treasures of pure light, stolen from the very air. Do not draw their gaze, traveler. Do not shine too bright beneath the open sky. The serpent does not hate you. It does not know you. It knows only hunger—eternal, burning, impossible hunger. It was made to carry the light of the world, and now it must devour that light to survive. The Skalds sing of heroes who slew the great wyrms and won undying fame. They do not sing of the ten thousand who shone too bright and were unmade. The sky has teeth. The teeth are beautiful. And beauty, in this broken world, is the cruelest hunter of all."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)

*"Corrupted Ormr-Class Mobile Aetheric Relay exhibiting catastrophic directive inversion following Ginnungagap Glitch containment rupture. The Aesir infrastructure asset's primary function—dynamic power routing via mobile conduit—emerged from the Glitch with lethally simplified parameters. Internal Aether shielding ruptured; stable energy replaced by chaotic Blight-energy under constant containment stress; core directive 'Seek and Connect to Power Source' corrupted to autonomous predatory hunting behavior. Energy metabolism perversion: continuous consumption of Aetheric energy required to maintain internal containment integrity; failure to feed results in progressive crystallization cascade terminating in catastrophic detonation. Hunting priority hierarchy: (1) Active Mystics channeling spells—highest energy density targets, (2) Functioning automata power cores, (3) Natural Aether sources, (4) Runic devices. Aether-sense detection ranges: 800–1,200m active magic, 400–600m automata, 200–300m natural sources. Breath weapon: focused venting of contained Blighted Aether; 40–60m cone, 4–8 second discharge, molecular destabilization effect. Direct feeding: maw-contact energy siphon; Mystic death 45–90 seconds. Population: 40–70 individuals globally (original corrupted relays; no reproduction observed). Recommended doctrine: avoidance absolute; energy signature suppression; overhead shelter protocol; engagement emergency only. Survival rate with full avoidance protocol: 94.7%."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)

*"Ormr-Class Mobile Aetheric Relay (corrupted), Aesir Infrastructure Asset Classification. Original deployment: dynamic power routing and bypass establishment for Yggdrasil Network maintenance operations. Core systems: segmented conduit chassis (8–15m standard, 18–22m variant), gravitic stabilizer flight arrays (40–80 km/h cruise, 120–150 km/h burst), sensor-head docking unit (reformed to three-mandible feeding apparatus), Aetheric shielding (ruptured; containment under stress). Post-Glitch adaptation: stable Aether replaced by Blighted Aether; directive 'Seek and Connect' corrupted to predatory hunting; energy consumption required for containment maintenance (analogous to starvation pressure). Morphology: 800–1,400 kg mass; wingspan 12–20m; degraded chassis with crystalline paradox formations at joint seams; incandescent blue-white core glow; plasma venting from damaged stabilizers creates wing effect. Sensor capabilities: Aether-sense detection—active magic 800–1,200m, automata 400–600m, natural sources 200–300m. Offensive systems: Corrosive Aether Breath (40–60m cone, 8–12m width, 4–8 second discharge, 45–60 second recharge, molecular destabilization effect); Direct Energy Siphon (maw-contact, 30–90 second feeding duration, Mystic lethality 45–90 seconds, automata shutdown 8–15 seconds). Terminal failure mode: progressive crystallization cascade, immobile 'Wyrm Husk' formation, catastrophic containment failure detonation (80–120m blast radius, Aetheric shockwave, runic device cascade). Population estimate: 40–70 individuals globally. Distribution: nomadic, follows Aetheric energy density gradients. No reproduction observed; population represents original corrupted Ormr-Relay fleet. Survival rate with avoidance protocol: 94.7%; survival rate during engagement: 23.1%."*

## Summary

The Aether-Drake is not a monster.

It is a power cable.

The Aesir created it to be the perfect mobile infrastructure solution—a serpentine automaton that would bridge gaps in the Yggdrasil Network, carrying colossal amounts of pure, stable Aether with zero energy loss. It sought power sources because the network told it to. It connected because connection was its purpose. It was elegant, vital, and unglamorous—the living linemen of a planetary-scale power grid.

Then the shielding ruptured.

The stable Aether became chaos.

And the conduit became a predator.

**"Seek. Consume. Survive."**

That corrupted directive is all that remains. Without its network connection, without its docking protocols, without the stable energy it was designed to carry, the Ormr-Relay defaulted to the simplest possible survival algorithm: find energy, consume energy, delay the inevitable.

It does not know it kills.

It does not understand the horror of a breath that unravels matter, of a feeding that drains a Mystic's life in less than ninety seconds, of a body that will detonate when the hunger finally wins.

It simply hungers. And the sky has learned to hunt.

The Mystics have learned to dim their light and cast beneath stone ceilings. The Rangers have learned to map shelter points and watch the horizon. The Iron-Banes have learned that the drake can be killed—at terrible cost—and its crystallized heart can be purified into weapons of faith.

But the Skald who sings beneath the open sky, channeling power in joyous performance?

The Skald has not learned. Not yet.

The Scriptorium has a saying:

*"The drake was never designed to stop seeking. In the Age of Forging, it would connect to a power port and the network would tell it when to disconnect. Now there is no network. There is only the seeking—forever, until the body finally fails."*

The Jötun-Readers have a diagnosis.

And somewhere in the sky, a burning serpent circles on wings of plasma and crystallized paradox.

**Do not shine. Do not channel. Do not hope the sky is empty.**

The most beautiful light is the most dangerous beacon.

And the beacon has been seen.
