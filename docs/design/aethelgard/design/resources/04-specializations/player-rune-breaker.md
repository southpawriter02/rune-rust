# The Rune-Breaker — The Unraveler of Spells

> *"You see a Mystic weaving their Galdr and you think: power. You think: solution. I see the same Mystic and I think: vulnerability. I think: target. They channel tainted Aether through delicate mental constructs, complex 'programs' that require absolute focus. I don't need to understand the syntax of their spell. I don't need to counter it with magic of my own. I just need to smash the server it runs on. A fist to the throat interrupts the chant. A blow infused with my will shorts out their connection. And when I'm done, when I've broken every spell they tried to compile, they're just a fragile scholar in a robe. Easy prey."*

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Warrior |
| **Role** | Mystic Hunter / Aetheric Disruptor / Anti-Magic Specialist |
| **Path Type** | Coherent |
| **Primary Attribute** | MIGHT |
| **Secondary Attribute** | WILL |
| **Resource System** | Stamina |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | Moderate (high Psychic Stress exposure from magical combat) |

The **Rune-Breaker** is the Warrior specialization that embodies the philosophy that **if magic is a program, they are the ones who smash the server it runs on**.[^]

They are disciplined warriors who have trained their bodies and, more importantly, their minds to be living "dead zones" for the tainted Aether. They do not understand the complex syntax of a spell like a Jötun-Reader, nor do they care to. Their philosophy is brutally simple: they defy the Blight's metaphysical chaos with the undeniable, coherent truth of physical force and an unbreakable will.

To choose the Rune-Breaker is to embrace the fantasy of the ultimate anti-mage, the spell-shattering predator who hunts down those who would recklessly wield the world's broken code. Your saga is one of grim necessity—of protecting your allies from devastating magical attacks by systematically dismantling any caster who dares to chant in your presence.

## Core Philosophy: The Art of the Unmaking

### The Ultimate Antivirus

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Hardware Over Software** | Physical force solves magical problems |
| **The Unwritten Mind** | A mind empty of Aetheric ambition cannot be easily corrupted |
| **Smash the Server** | Attack the conduit, not the spell |

The Rune-Breaker's philosophy is rooted in a brutal truth about post-Glitch Aethelgard: **magic is dangerous, unpredictable, and should be stopped at the source**.[^] Where Mystics try to counter spell with spell (software vs. software), the Rune-Breaker uses overwhelming physical force and an indomitable will to attack the very conduit through which a Mystic channels their power.

> *"The Galdr-casters think their magic makes them gods. The Rust-Witches think embracing the Blight gives them power. They're all fools playing with fire in a tinderbox. I am the bucket of water. I am the suffocating blanket. I don't fight magic with magic—I fight magic with certainty. With physical truth. With a will so coherent that the chaotic Aether simply... stops... when I impose it."*

Their philosophy is not anti-intellectual—it is **anti-metaphysical**. The Rune-Breaker has studied magic not to use it, but to understand where it breaks.

### The Fortress of the Mind

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Passive Defense** | Mind trained to resist magical/psychic intrusion |
| **Active Disruption** | Project disruptive will to break concentration |
| **Punitive Response** | Gain strength from every spell they shatter |

The Rune-Breaker's mind is not a passive shield; it is an **active, hostile fortress**.[^] It is a pocket of pure, coherent, anti-magical logic that actively resists, disrupts, and even punishes the chaotic, corrupted "software" of the tainted Aether.

> *"The first lesson is simple: a mind empty of Aetheric ambition is a mind that cannot be easily corrupted. I do not crave magical power. I do not dream of channeling the Aether. My spirit is a silent, unwritten page—and into that silence, no magical intrusion can take root. The second lesson is harder: turn that silence into a weapon. Project it. Impose it. Make the caster feel their power slip away, like trying to scream underwater."*[^]

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Anti-mage who hunts and dismantles Mystic enemies |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Specialist predator; devastating vs magic, ordinary vs physical |
| **Success Metric** | Chants interrupted; buffs stripped; casters neutralized |
| **Decision Space** | Target prioritization; when to engage caster vs other threats |

Playing a Rune-Breaker is about **identifying the magical threat and systematically destroying their ability to function**.[^]

Your operational loop is:
1. **Identify**: Locate the Mystic among enemies (Galdr-caster, Rust-Witch, Echo-Caller, etc.)
2. **Close**: Move to engage the caster directly
3. **Disrupt**: Apply [Aether-Burn] with Grounding Strike to increase their costs
4. **Interrupt**: Use Shattering Shout to break any [Chanting] attempts
5. **Strip**: Use Spell-Sunder to remove protective magical buffs
6. **Finish**: Inertial Slam to apply [Grounded] and completely shut them down

> *"Against a Berserker or a pack of Blighted Beasts, I'm a capable warrior—nothing special. But against a Mystic? I am their absolute nightmare. I close the distance before they can finish their chant. I ground their chaotic energy with every strike. I shatter their spells with a shout. I strip their magical defenses. And when I finally reach them, when I slam my weapon into their skull with such force that it severs their connection to the Aether entirely—they're just a fragile scholar in a robe. Easy prey."*

You're not a generalist—you're the party's **silver bullet** against magical threats.

### The Trade-Off

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Devastating anti-magic toolkit | Unremarkable against physical threats |
| High resistance to magical/psychic effects | Useless against [Beast] and non-magical [Humanoid] factions |
| Can completely shut down enemy Mystics | No specific advantage against Berserkers, Blighted Beasts |
| Protects party from magical attacks | High specialization means situational value |
| Coherent path (no Corruption accumulation) | High Psychic Stress exposure from magical combat |

The Rune-Breaker is **hyper-specialized**.[^] They are overwhelmingly powerful against Mystics, but completely and utterly useless against non-magical foes. This makes them a situational "silver bullet"—a crucial strategic asset for certain encounters but a simple, straightforward warrior in others.

> *"Yes, I'm useless against a pack of Blighted Boars. Yes, a rival Berserker doesn't care about my anti-magic abilities. That's the trade-off. I'm not trying to be good at everything. I'm trying to be perfect at one thing: making sure the enemy caster never gets to cast. In a fight with Mystics, I'm indispensable. In a fight without them, I'm just another sword arm. Know your battles."*

## Core Mechanics: The Three Pillars

### Pillar 1: Aetheric Disruption

| **Function** | Increase AP costs; interrupt chants; strip magical buffs |
| **[Aether-Burn]** | +25% AP cost to all abilities for 2 rounds |
| **Shattering Shout** | Force WILL check or chant interrupted |
| **Spell-Sunder** | Remove one beneficial magical buff on hit |

**Aetheric Disruption** is the core offensive mechanic—the act of smashing the server that a program is running on.[^]

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

> *"The disruption is violent and physical. My strikes are infused with my disruptive will, causing them to 'short-circuit' a Mystic's connection to the Aether. Their power costs more. Their concentration breaks. Their buffs shatter. I'm not countering their spell—I'm attacking the conduit they channel it through. Different target, same result: they can't cast."*[^]

### Pillar 2: Imposing Will

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Resist magical/psychic effects; project disruptive aura |

**Imposing Will** is the defensive and aura mechanic—turning the mind into a weapon.[^]

| Component | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Passive Resistance** | Will of the Unwritten grants +1d10 to resist magic |
| **Proximity Disruption** | Aura of Dissonance makes nearby spellcasting harder |
| **Punitive Defense** | Devour Magic rewards successful disruption with Stamina |

> *"My mind is not a passive shield. It is an active, hostile fortress. A pocket of pure, coherent, anti-magical logic that actively resists, disrupts, and punishes the chaotic Aether. When a Mystic tries to assault my mind, they find a wall of unwritten silence. When they try to cast near me, they find their power costs more. And when I successfully break their spell? I feel a surge of coherent energy—their broken magic becoming my fuel."*[^]

### Pillar 3: Shattering Blows

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Bonus damage against magical constructs and objects |
| **Runic Wardbreaker** | +50% damage to magical barriers, traps, summoned entities |

The Rúnasmiðr lays their clever [Hagalaz Trap]? I hit it with such perfectly calibrated force that it decompiles before it can trigger. Magical constructs are fragile things when you know how to break them."*[^]

| Philosophy | A mind empty of Aetheric ambition cannot be easily corrupted |

| [Aether-Burn] Effect | +25% AP cost to all target abilities |
| Resistance | Target makes WILL Resolve Check |

> *"A solid, forceful blow designed not just to wound the body, but to sever the target's connection to the tainted Aether. I'm channeling my unwavering, anti-magical will directly into the strike. The blow grounds their chaotic energy into the earth. Their power stutters. Their costs spike. They feel their magic slip away."*[^]

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cost | 35 Stamina |
| Target | Single enemy currently in [Chanting] state |
| Mechanic | Target makes difficult WILL Resolve Check |
| On Failure | Chant interrupted; spell fails |
| Nature | Physical shockwave, not magical |

> *"Not a magical sound—a pure, physical shockwave calibrated to disrupt the delicate somatic and vocal components of a spell chant. The caster needs absolute focus to compile their 'program.' I break that focus with a shout that hits them like a wall. Their chant falters. Their spell fails. And I'm already closing the distance."*[^]

### Tier 2 — Advanced Unraveling

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Spell-Sunder** | Active | 45 Stamina | MIGHT attack + remove one magical buff from target |

| Valid Targets | Buffs of [Magical] or [Arcane] type only |

That [Fortified] buff from the Vard-Warden's spell? Gone. That [Inspired] aura from the Skald's saga? Shattered. I don't need to understand their magic to break it. I just need to hit it hard enough."*[^]

**Runic Wardbreaker** is the construct-shattering passive—the learned resonance.[^]

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Type | Passive |
| Effect | +50% bonus damage to magical objects |

It's not about brute force—it's about percussive analysis. I know where the keystone is. I know where to hit to make the whole thing collapse."*[^]

**Aura of Dissonance** is the proximity disruption—the dead zone aura.[^]

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Type | Passive Aura |
| Range | Same row as Rune-Breaker |
| Effect | All enemies in range: +10% AP cost to all abilities |
| Stacking | Does not require debuff slot on enemy |

> *"My very presence is a 'dead zone' for the Aether. My coherent, anti-magical will projects a disruptive field. Casters near me find their power costs more—they're fighting through static just to compile their spells. I don't even have to hit them. Just being in the same row is enough to tax their resources."*[^]

### Tier 3 — Mastery of the Silence

| Ability | Type | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| **Inertial Slam** | Active | 55 Stamina | High-damage MIGHT attack; vs Mystics: high chance to apply [Grounded] |
| **Devour Magic** | Passive | — | Recover Stamina when successfully interrupting or dispelling |

| Cost | 55 Stamina |
| Damage | High Physical (MIGHT-based) |
| Special vs Mystics | High chance to apply [Grounded] for 1 round |
| [Grounded] Effect | Target cannot spend Aether Points |

> *"A devastating finishing blow. I slam my opponent with so much force that it not only grounds their active spell but creates a psychic backlash that temporarily severs their connection to the Aether entirely. For one round, they are [Grounded]—unable to spend a single Aether Point. They can't cast. They can't channel. They can only die."*[^]

**Devour Magic** is the feedback loop—drawing strength from broken spells.[^]

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Type | Passive |
| Trigger | Successfully interrupt chant (Shattering Shout) or remove buff (Spell-Sunder) |
| Effect | Instantly recover moderate amount of Stamina |
| Philosophy | Shattering enemy magic releases coherent energy you can absorb |

> *"The Rune-Breaker learns to draw strength from the chaos they unmake. Shattering an enemy's spell releases a burst of coherent energy—the anti-logical Aether collapsing back into stable patterns. I've learned to absorb that release. Every spell I break, every buff I strip, fuels my physical prowess. The more they try to cast, the stronger I become."*[^]

## Systemic Integration

### Combat Role: The Mystic Hunter

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Primary Function** | Hunt and neutralize enemy Mystics; protect party from magical attacks |
| **Power Source** | Coherent physical force and trained mental discipline |
| **Unique Contribution** | Only specialization built entirely around anti-magic |

The Rune-Breaker is the party's **ultimate answer to enemy Mystics**.[^] Their role is to hunt down the Galdr-caster, the Rust-Witch, or the Echo-Caller and systematically neutralize them as a threat, protecting the rest of the party from devastating magical attacks.

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Coherent (no Corruption accumulation) |
| **Psychic Stress** | High exposure from constant magical combat |
| **WILL Stat** | Critical for survival and effectiveness |
| **Campaign Arc** | Stable against corruption; vulnerable to Stress |

The Rune-Breaker is a **"coherent" warrior**—they do not willingly gain Corruption.[^] Their philosophy rejects the tainted Aether entirely. However, their constant battle against the metaphysical horrors of the Blight puts them at high risk of gaining Psychic Stress, making their WILL score a vital defensive stat.

> *"I don't touch the Aether. I don't bargain with the Blight. I am clean—coherent—uncorrupted. But that doesn't mean this work is without cost. Every spell I shatter, every magical horror I face, every psychic assault I endure—it wears on the mind. I've watched Rune-Breakers who broke too many spells, faced too many horrors. Their minds cracked under the Stress while their souls stayed pure. The Corruption can't touch me. The madness still can."*

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Galdr-casters** | Rune-Breaker protects allied casters from enemy interruption |
| **Physical damage dealers** | Rune-Breaker strips magical defenses, leaving targets vulnerable |
| **Skjaldmær** | Tank holds line while Rune-Breaker hunts casters |
| **Jötun-Reader** | Intelligence about enemy capabilities helps prioritize targets |
| **Any party vs Mystic-heavy encounters** | Indispensable specialist role |

**Negative Synergies:**

| Situation | Issue |
|-----------|-------|
| **The Great Silence** | Affects allies too—friendly Mystics lose buffs and AP access |
| **Physical-only encounters** | Entire anti-magic toolkit becomes useless |
| **Parties without Mystic threats** | Rune-Breaker offers no special advantage |
| **Multi-Mystic parties** | Zone of Silence hurts allies as much as enemies |

### Situational Power Profile

| Condition | Performance |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Optimal** | Encounters with enemy Mystics; caster-heavy enemy compositions |
| **Weak** | Physical-only encounters; non-magical [Beast] swarms |
| **Hard Counters** | Enemy Galdr-casters; Rust-Witches; Echo-Callers; any Mystic archetype |
| **Hard Countered By** | Blighted Beasts; rival Warriors; any non-magical threat |

## Combat Loop Example

### The Mystic Hunt

TURN 1: IDENTIFY

├─ Scan battlefield: Locate enemy Mystic (Galdr-caster)

├─ Note: Galdr-caster in back row, preparing to chant

├─ Aura of Dissonance already affecting enemies in same row

└─ Decision: Close distance to caster

TURN 2: CLOSE & DISRUPT

├─ Move to engage Galdr-caster

├─ Grounding Strike → MIGHT attack + [Aether-Burn] applied

├─ Galdr-caster now has +25% AP cost on all abilities

└─ Current state: Caster taxed, preparing to chant anyway

TURN 3: INTERRUPT

├─ Galdr-caster enters [Chanting] state for powerful spell

├─ Shattering Shout → Force WILL Resolve Check

├─ Galdr-caster fails check → Chant interrupted

├─ Devour Magic triggers → Recover Stamina

└─ Current state: Spell failed; Rune-Breaker energized

TURN 4: STRIP

├─ Galdr-caster still has [Arcane Shield] buff active

├─ Spell-Sunder → MIGHT attack + strip magical buff

├─ [Arcane Shield] removed

├─ Devour Magic triggers again → More Stamina recovered

└─ Current state: Caster exposed, no defenses

TURN 5: EXECUTE

├─ Inertial Slam → High-damage MIGHT attack

├─ Target is Mystic → [Grounded] applied

├─ Galdr-caster cannot spend Aether Points for 1 round

└─ Current state: Caster completely neutralized

TURN 6+: FINISH

├─ Continue attacks on [Grounded] caster

├─ They cannot cast, cannot defend with magic

├─ Just a fragile scholar in a robe

└─ RESULT: Enemy Mystic eliminated; party protected

EMERGENCY: THE GREAT SILENCE

├─ Multiple enemy casters; overwhelming magical assault

├─ Activate The Great Silence (60 Stamina + Psychic Stress)

├─ ALL magical effects removed from battlefield

├─ [Zone of Silence] created for 3 rounds

├─ NO ONE can spend Aether Points

├─ Fight becomes purely physical

└─ RESULT: Total magical shutdown; level playing field

## Lore Integration

### The Philosophy of the Unwritten

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Heritage** | Warriors who discovered that will alone can resist magic |
| **Philosophy** | Magic is a dangerous program; physical force is the solution |
| **Method** | Train mind to be dead zone; attack conduit, not spell |
| **Status** | Respected as specialists; feared by Mystics |

The Rune-Breaker tradition emerged from warriors who discovered that **a disciplined mind, emptied of Aetheric ambition, could resist magical intrusion**.[^] They refined this discovery into a systematic approach to hunting and neutralizing Mystics—not by matching magic with magic, but by attacking the very ability to cast.

> *"The first Rune-Breakers were warriors who noticed something strange: the Mystics who craved power the most were the most vulnerable to corruption. The warriors who wanted nothing from the Aether were nearly immune to its intrusions. From that observation came a question: what if we weaponized that immunity? What if we turned our empty minds into hostile territory for magic? The answer became our art."*

### The Necessary Weapon

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Training** | Years of mental discipline; emptying the mind of Aetheric desire |
| **Specialization** | Learning the resonant frequencies of magical constructs |
| **Mastery** | Projecting disruptive will as an aura; creating zones of silence |
| **Legacy** | Protecting settlements from heretical casters |

The Rune-Breaker's role is one of **grim necessity**.[^] In a world where the Runic Blight has made magic both powerful and dangerous, someone must hunt down those who wield it recklessly. The Rune-Breaker does not seek glory or power—they seek to prevent the magical catastrophes that threaten settlements and expeditions.

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Galdr-casters** | Fear and respect; "The one foe we cannot counter with magic" |
| **Rust-Witches** | Hatred; "They destroy what we embrace" |
| **Jötun-Readers** | Professional appreciation; "A useful tool against magical threats" |
| **Common Soldiers** | Relief; "Finally, someone who can stop those damn casters" |
| **Other Warriors** | Mild confusion; "Why train to fight only one type of enemy?" |
| **Rúnasmiðr** | Wariness; "Their methods are blunt but effective" |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the shattered realms of Aethelgard, where the Runic Blight has twisted magic into a form of corrupted, infectious code, the Rune-Breaker stands as the ultimate antivirus. They are disciplined warriors who have trained their bodies and minds to be living 'dead zones' for the tainted Aether. Their philosophy is brutally simple: if magic is a program, they are the ones who smash the server it runs on. They do not understand the complex syntax of a spell—nor do they care to. They defy the Blight's metaphysical chaos with the undeniable, coherent truth of physical force and an unbreakable will. Their attacks sever a Mystic's connection to the Aether. Their shouts shatter concentration mid-chant. Their very presence creates a 'dead zone' where spellcasting costs more and magic flickers uncertainly. At the pinnacle of their mastery, they can project The Great Silence—a localized reenactment of the event that broke the world's magic, creating a zone where all magic simply stops. Their saga is one of grim necessity: hunting down those who would recklessly wield the world's broken code and shattering their spells before they can be compiled. Against Mystics, they are terrifying predators. Against purely physical threats, they are capable but unremarkable. This is the trade-off they accept. This is the price of perfect specialization."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Rune-Breaker represents the coherent Warrior specialization optimized for anti-magic combat and Mystic neutralization. Mechanical role: hyper-specialized Mystic hunter with devastating effectiveness against casters and minimal advantage against physical threats. Core mechanics: Aetheric Disruption (Grounding Strike applies [Aether-Burn] for +25% AP costs, Shattering Shout interrupts [Chanting], Spell-Sunder strips magical buffs), Imposing Will (Will of the Unwritten grants +1d10 to WILL Resolve Checks vs magic, Aura of Dissonance passively increases AP costs for nearby enemies, Devour Magic recovers Stamina on successful disruption), and Shattering Blows (Runic Wardbreaker grants +50% damage to magical constructs, Inertial Slam applies [Grounded] to prevent Aether Point spending). Key differentiator: only specialization built entirely around anti-magic; creates unique 'Mystic hunter' role; extreme situational power profile. Signature ability: The Great Silence (AoE dispel of ALL magical effects + 3-round [Zone of Silence] where no one can spend AP, costs large Psychic Stress). Trauma Economy integration: Coherent path with no Corruption accumulation; high Psychic Stress exposure from constant magical combat; WILL stat critical for survival. Social function: respected specialist; feared by enemy Mystics; protector of allied casters. Optimal deployment: encounters with enemy Mystics; caster-heavy enemy compositions; parties with physical damage dealers who benefit from stripped magical defenses."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Rune-Breaker. ARCHETYPE: Warrior. PATH TYPE: Coherent. ROLE: Mystic Hunter / Aetheric Disruptor / Anti-Magic Specialist. PRIMARY STAT: MIGHT. SECONDARY STAT: WILL. RESOURCE: Stamina. CORE MECHANICS: Aetheric Disruption ([Aether-Burn] debuff +25% AP cost for 2 rounds applied by Grounding Strike, Shattering Shout interrupts [Chanting] via WILL Resolve Check, Spell-Sunder removes one magical buff on hit), Imposing Will (Will of the Unwritten grants +1d10 to WILL Resolve Checks vs magic/psychic, Aura of Dissonance applies +10% AP cost to enemies in same row, Devour Magic recovers Stamina on successful interrupt/dispel), Shattering Blows (Runic Wardbreaker +50% damage to magical objects/constructs/summons, Inertial Slam applies [Grounded] to Mystics preventing AP spending for 1 round). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Disruption): Will of the Unwritten (passive, +1d10 WILL vs magic), Grounding Strike (40 Stamina, MIGHT attack + [Aether-Burn] 2 rounds), Shattering Shout (35 Stamina, interrupt [Chanting] via WILL check). T2 (Advanced Unraveling): Spell-Sunder (45 Stamina, MIGHT attack + strip one magical buff), Runic Wardbreaker (passive, +50% damage vs magical constructs), Aura of Dissonance (passive, enemies in same row +10% AP cost). T3 (Mastery of the Silence): Inertial Slam (55 Stamina, high damage MIGHT attack, vs Mystics high chance [Grounded] 1 round), Devour Magic (passive, recover Stamina on successful interrupt/dispel). CAPSTONE: The Great Silence (60 Stamina + large Psychic Stress, once per combat, removes ALL magical effects from ALL combatants, creates [Zone of Silence] for 3 rounds where no character can spend AP and Reality Glitch chance = 0). TRAUMA ECONOMY: Coherent; no Corruption; high Psychic Stress exposure from magical combat. HARD COUNTERS: Any enemy Mystic archetype. HARD COUNTERED BY: Non-magical threats (Blighted Beasts, rival Warriors, physical-only enemies)."*

## Summary

The Rune-Breaker is the **ultimate antivirus in a world where magic is corrupted code**.

They are Warriors who have trained their bodies and minds to be living "dead zones" for the tainted Aether. Their philosophy is brutally simple: if magic is a program, they smash the server it runs on. They don't counter spell with spell—they attack the conduit, break the concentration, and sever the connection.

Their gameplay is **hyper-specialized Mystic hunting**. Against enemy casters, they are devastating predators who increase AP costs with [Aether-Burn], interrupt chants with Shattering Shout, strip magical buffs with Spell-Sunder, and completely shut down casters with [Grounded]. Against physical threats, they offer no special advantage—they're just another capable warrior.

Their unique mechanic is **Imposing Will**—a suite of mental defenses and disruptive auras that makes them nearly immune to magical assault while creating a "dead zone" that taxes any caster who tries to operate near them. The Devour Magic passive creates a feedback loop where every broken spell fuels their physical prowess.

The capstone The Great Silence represents the ultimate expression—a localized reenactment of the event that broke the world's magic, creating a zone where ALL magic stops for three rounds. It affects friend and foe alike, at massive Psychic Stress cost to the Rune-Breaker.

This is the fantasy of the **warrior who has made themselves anathema to magic**—not through heretical bargains, but through disciplined rejection of Aetheric ambition.

*"If magic is a program, I am the one who smashes the server."*
*"A mind empty of Aetheric ambition cannot be easily corrupted."*
*"Against Mystics, I am their absolute nightmare."*
