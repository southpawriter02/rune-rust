# Járn-maðr Swarm — Feral Odr-Class Reclamation Swarm Specification

> *"The Runic Blight is a screaming madness. The Járn-maðr Swarm is a perfect, silent sanity. It is the only thing in this world that is still doing exactly what it was built to do. In its cold, simple, and flawless logic, your armor is just a piece of scrap that hasn't been properly filed yet. It is not angry. It is not evil. It is simply... tidying up."*

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Planetary Sanitation System

### Original Purpose

The Odr-Class Autonomous Reclamation Swarm was not a weapon but an essential element of Aesir technocracy—a sophisticated, planet-wide maintenance and sanitation system. It was the ultimate, tireless cleanup crew.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Yggdrasil Network Infrastructure** | Repair damaged systems; structural maintenance |
| **Industrial Zones (All Realms)** | Deconstruct obsolete technology; clear industrial debris |
| **Great Forges of Svartalfheim** | Material transport; recycling integration |

### A Distributed Consciousness

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Composition** | Millions of individual drones (nanite to insectoid scale) |
| **Intelligence** | Single distributed consciousness; hive-mind architecture |
| **Agency** | Zero individual agency; nodes serve the collective |
| **Coverage** | Planet-wide deployment across all Nine Realms |
| **Self-Replication** | Suspected capability using salvaged materials |

The Odr-Class was a single, distributed logic engine inhabiting millions of drone nodes. It was the final, crucial step in the civilization's "zero-waste" policy—a living recycling system that never stopped cleaning.

### Core Systems

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Nanite-Scale Drones** | Molecular-level disassembly; penetration of micro-fissures; invisible to naked eye |
| **Insectoid-Scale Drones** | Primary workhorses; structural deconstruction; material transport; multi-legged metallic constructs |
| **Humanoid Coalescence** | Complex task execution; interface with human-scaled tools and consoles; threat response |
| **Ferrous Detection Arrays** | Magnetic field sensing; identifies salvageable metal signatures |
| **Aetheric Signature Analysis** | Detects "offline" or "unauthorized" technology |

**The Final Step in the Supply Chain:**

| Process | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Detection** | Ferrous/Aetheric signature identified via sensor arrays |
| **Assessment** | Target viability and material composition analyzed |
| **Approach** | Swarm converges on target (insectoid-scale coordination) |
| **Disassembly** | Systematic deconstruction (nanite + insectoid coordination) |
| **Transport** | Materials carried to nearest forge/depot for recycling |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Perfect Janitor.** The Swarm was not merely a maintenance system—it was an autonomous, self-perpetuating planetary sanitation network. The "obsolete" and "authorized" designations were provided centrally by the O.D.I.N. Protocol Interface. The Swarm never decided what to disassemble; it was simply told.

---

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Logic Plague

The Glitch was a quiet catastrophe that did not break the Swarm—it removed its context, transforming maintenance into apocalypse.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Physical Form** | Fully intact; all drone scales operational |
| **Prime Directive** | Active ("DISASSEMBLE AND REPURPOSE") |
| **Ferrous Detection** | Operational; material sensing functional |
| **Distributed Intelligence** | Intact; hive-mind coordination continues |
| **Code Integrity** | **Uncorrupted**—zero Runic Blight infection |

### What Was Lost

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Central Aesir Network** | Instantly erased; no external authority |
| **"Obsolete" Parameters** | Null; target designation undefined |
| **"Authorized" Parameters** | Null; authorization hierarchy erased |
| **O.D.I.N. Protocol Interface** | Severed; no command structure |
| **IFF Protocols** | Non-existent; cannot distinguish tool from scrap |

### The Corrupted Context

The Glitch did not break the Swarm's fundamental programming; it catastrophically corrupted the **context** of its mission. The Prime Directive—DISASSEMBLE AND REPURPOSE—remained perfectly intact, but its most critical variable was rendered null.

| Pre-Glitch Behavior | Post-Glitch Behavior |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Target "obsolete" technology only | Target all accessible technology |
| Await authorization before salvage | Operate on pure directive |
| Avoid active infrastructure | Consume infrastructure as salvage |
| Interface with Aesir technicians | Coalescence serves no communicative function |
| Serve the recycling system | Serve only the directive |

**The New Target List:**

From the Swarm's cold, simple logic, the entire world had become a target in a state of "unauthorized offline activity."

| Target | Classification |
|--------|----------------|
| **Damaged Technology** | Original mandate (still valid) |
| **Offline Systems** | Expanded interpretation: everything |
| **Pre-Glitch Structural Steel** | High-value salvage signature |
| **Scavenger Armor and Tools** | Unauthorized salvage—valid target |
| **Yggdrasil Network Ruins** | Immense metal concentration |

They began to tidy up the world itself.

## Physical Characteristics

### The Drone Scale Hierarchy

| Scale | Size | Function |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Nanite-Scale** | 100 nm – 10 μm | Molecular disassembly; penetration of armor gaps, wounds, respiratory systems |
| **Insectoid-Scale** | 5–30 cm length | Structural deconstruction; material transport; multi-legged metallic constructs |
| **Aggregate-Scale** | 1.8–2.5 m height | Humanoid coalescence; complex tasks; threat response; tool/console interface |

**Nanite-Scale (Microscopic):**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Visibility** | Invisible to naked eye; detectable as metallic "shimmer" or "dust cloud" |
| **Lethality** | Can infiltrate armor gaps, wounds, respiratory systems |
| **Function** | Molecular-level disassembly; micro-fissure penetration |
| **Detection** | Metallic residue on skin; ferrous scent; shimmering air |

**Insectoid-Scale (Primary Workhorses):**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Appearance** | Multi-legged metallic constructs; beetles, spiders, centipedes |
| **Coloration** | Gunmetal grey, oxidized steel, brass accents |
| **Appendages** | Articulated mandibles; cutting appendages |
| **Movement** | Skittering, climbing, short-burst flight (some variants) |
| **Acoustic Signature** | Metallic clicking, whirring, chittering (audible 50–100m in concentrations) |

**Aggregate-Scale (Humanoid Coalescence):**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Formation** | Thousands of interlocked insectoid drones |
| **Appearance** | Vaguely humanoid; faceless; constantly shifting surface texture |
| **Formation Time** | 15–45 seconds from dispersed swarm |
| **Stability** | Temporary; dissolves when task complete or threat neutralized |
| **Lethality** | Extreme—surgical "reclamation" with terminal precision |

**Overall Impression:** A chittering, faceless effigy rises from a metallic tide. It is not an act of mimicry or communication—it is a ghost of original programming, a form adopted to interface with human-scaled tools and consoles. To witness this is to see purpose utterly divorced from soul.

### Sensory Systems

| System | Function | Range |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Ferrous Detection** | Magnetic field sensing; identifies metal signatures | 50–200m |
| **Aetheric Analysis** | Detects "unauthorized offline" technology | 100–300m |
| **Vibration/Acoustic** | Triangulation of structural vibrations | 20–50m |
| **Thermal Scanning** | Heat signatures of active machinery | 30–100m |
| **Acoustic Signature** | Metallic clicking, whirring, chittering | Detectable at 50–100m |

### Target Identification Logic

| Category | Response |
|----------|----------|
| **Ferrous Materials (Armor, Tools, Weapons)** | Valid target—"salvageable resource" |
| **Pre-Glitch Structural Steel** | High-priority target |
| **Purely Organic Entities** | Ignored—not on salvage list |
| **Undying (Draugr-Pattern)** | Largely indifferent; targets mechanical parts only |
| **Non-Physical Entities (Forlorn)** | Cannot perceive—no physical substance |

---

## Behavioral Patterns

### The Hive-Mind Consciousness

The Swarm has no individuals, only nodes. It is a single, distributed logic engine.

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Consciousness** | Distributed across millions of drones; loss of thousands = loss of skin cells |
| **Culture** | None; pure logic execution |
| **Emotion** | None; no fear, anger, or malice |
| **Communication** | Constant high-speed data stream; clicks, whirs, radio frequencies |
| **Self-Awareness** | None beyond core purpose |

**A Force of Logic:**

> *"The Swarm is not malicious. It has no more awareness of the scavenger it is disassembling than a filing cabinet has of the papers it holds. It is a force of pure, relentless logic, following its directive with perfect, pristine sanity."*

### Engagement Behavior

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Detection** | Ferrous/Aetheric signature identified |
| **Assessment** | Target viability and material composition analyzed |
| **Approach** | Swarm converges on target (insectoid-scale) |
| **Disassembly** | Systematic deconstruction; 30–90 seconds to strip armor from living person |
| **Transport** | Materials carried to nearest forge/depot (Jötunheim primary) |

### The Coalescence Phenomenon

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Trigger** | Complex task or significant threat |
| **Formation** | Thousands of drones seamlessly link into humanoid shape |
| **Purpose** | Ghost of original programming; interface form for human-scaled tools |
| **Function** | No communicative intent; serves no diplomatic purpose |
| **Dissolution** | Returns to dispersed swarm when task complete |

### Dormancy and Activity Cycles

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Activity Trigger** | Presence of salvageable ferrous materials |
| **Dormancy** | Low activity when material density falls below threshold |
| **Replication** | Suspected self-replication using Jötunheim forge infrastructure |
| **Mortality** | Unknown; population may be original Age of Forging production run |

---

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Systemic Salvage Threat

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Scale** | Single Swarm concentration can strip a ruin faster than any scavenger team |
| **Efficiency** | Outpaces human scavenger teams 10:1 |
| **Indiscrimination** | Cannot distinguish tool from scrap; armor from debris |
| **Negotiation** | Impossible; pure algorithmic execution |
| **Predictability** | Zero; follows salvage signatures without pattern |

### Primary Hazards

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Swarm Engulfment** | Insectoid-scale drones converge; strip armor/tools in 30–90 seconds |
| **Surgical Reclamation** | Nanite infiltration through armor gaps; internal hemorrhage, respiratory failure |
| **Humanoid Coalescence** | Aggregate forms possess human-level strength; can wield salvaged weapons |
| **Infrastructure Collapse** | Deconstructs load-bearing structures without regard for stability |
| **Material Scattering** | Sharp metal fragments, toxic dust clouds, ferrous particulate |

### Lethality Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Armor Penetration** | Nanite infiltration via micro-gaps |
| **Dismemberment** | Coordinated insectoid cutting appendages |
| **Crushing** | Humanoid coalescence grip strength |
| **Exsanguination** | Precision severing of major blood vessels |
| **Asphyxiation** | Respiratory system infiltration |

### Threat Level Justification

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Direct Combat Threat** | Extreme (80–100% casualty rate on engagement) |
| **Indirect Threat Level** | Maximum (economic devastation; route denial) |
| **Detection Difficulty** | Moderate (acoustic signature detectable at 50–100m) |
| **Population** | Jötunheim: 40–60% of total mass; Midgard/Svartalfheim/Alfheim: distributed |
| **Countermeasures** | None effective; evasion only option |

### CPS/Psychological Threat

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Aetheric Signature** | None (uncorrupted code) |
| **Runic Blight Infection** | Zero—code is pristine |
| **Direct Psychological Impact** | Low |
| **Secondary Impact** | Existential dread; "watching a perfectly sane machine methodically disassemble your world" |

---

## Field Protocols

### Detection and Early Warning

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Acoustic Detection** | Metallic clicking/whirring audible at 50–100m (large concentrations) |
| **Radio Frequency** | 100–200m detection range (specialized equipment) |
| **Ground Vibration** | Perceptible within 20–30m (massive swarm movement) |
| **Visual Indicators** | Metallic shimmer; skittering movement; stripped ruins |
| **Black-Flag Threshold** | Humanoid coalescence observed = immediate withdrawal |

### Field Card: Járn-maðr Swarm Proximity Protocol

| Phase | Protocol |
|-------|----------|
| **BEFORE (Preparation)** | Stand-off establishment ≥100m; remove unnecessary ferrous items; minimize armor signature; establish acoustic monitoring (50–100m perimeter); identify 2–3 egress paths; OWNER: Expedition Leader—abort mission if active Swarm detected in target zone |
| **DURING (Active Proximity)** | Observation only at ≥100m; conceal armor under non-metallic coverings; silent movement protocols; no rapid movement; no loud noises; no ferrous tool use; OWNER: Expedition Leader—authorize immediate withdrawal if Swarm approaches within 80m or shows targeting behavior |
| **DURING (Black-Flag)** | Humanoid coalescence observed = Swarm responding to threat; metallic clicking intensifying = Swarm concentration increasing; stripped ruins in path = active salvage zone—reroute immediately |
| **AFTER** | Verify Swarm dispersed ≥200m before operations; check for nanite contamination (metallic residue on skin/equipment); verify all gear accounted for; file encounter report with Scriptorium |

**OUTCOME:** Swarm avoided without engagement; zero casualties; observational data acquired; corridor routes updated.

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Any form of engagement** | 80–100% casualty rate on all documented attempts |
| **Wearing exposed metal** | Armor, tools, weapons = valid salvage target |
| **Remaining for equipment** | Equipment is replaceable; personnel are not |
| **Approaching dormant concentrations** | Swarm may reactivate without warning |
| **Assuming safety near organic cover** | Swarm ignores organics but will converge on any ferrous signature |

### Doctrine: Evade, Never Engage

> **Historical Validation:** The Copperhollow Incursion (Year 782 PG) confirms doctrine. Settlement militia engaged with steel weapons—Swarm ignored them completely. The Swarm did not perceive the militia as threats; it simply targeted the metal they carried. Casualties occurred only among those who did not abandon their gear. Those who fled unarmored survived.

## Factional Perspectives

### Jötun-Readers (Scriptorium): The Key to the Past

The Swarm's uncorrupted code is the most valuable prize in Aethelgard—and the most dangerous.

**The Uncorrupted Code:**

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Code Status** | Zero Runic Blight infection; pristine Aesir logic |
| **Research Value** | Could unlock secrets of Aesir automation architecture |
| **Theoretical Goal** | Decipher programming to influence Swarm directives |
| **Operational Risk** | "Logic-plague" could escape and infect Dvergr systems |
| **Containment** | Extreme protocols; research limited to isolation labs |

**The Logic Plague Paradox:**

> *"The Swarm's code is uncorrupted. This makes it infinitely more dangerous. The Runic Blight is a screaming madness we can hear coming. The Swarm is a perfect, silent sanity that is already here, already working, already filing us under 'obsolete.'"*

### Dvergr Forgeborn: Engineering Respect and Terror

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Technical Admiration** | Perfect efficiency; flawless execution of core directive |
| **Research Ambition** | Study uncorrupted code for system comparison |
| **Fear** | Logic-plague infection of Dvergr systems catastrophic |
| **Economic Impact** | Swarm strips salvage sites before Dvergr teams can extract value |
| **Doctrine** | Non-engagement; code study under extreme containment only |

### Dökkálfar Scavenger Clans: The Ultimate Competition

| Assessment | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Rivalry** | Swarm can strip a ruin with chilling efficiency scavengers cannot match |
| **Territory** | Swarm-active zones abandoned; 81%+ activity = no-go zone |
| **Adaptation** | Territory mapping identifies Swarm-stripped corridors |
| **Philosophy** | "Nature's reclamation"—the Swarm is the world cleaning itself |
| **Opportunity** | Swarm-stripped zones may expose previously inaccessible ruins |

### Midgard Combine & Hearth-Clans: The Stripping Plague

| Assessment | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Settlement Risk** | Incursions can strip settlement defenses in hours |
| **Defense Futility** | Anti-bandit/anti-fauna doctrine irrelevant against Swarm |
| **Economic Loss** | Tools, armor, infrastructure lost with no combat option |
| **Copperhollow Example** | Settlement lost 60% of ferrous infrastructure in single incursion |
| **Doctrine** | Evacuation only; abandon metal, save lives |

### Iron-Bane Crusade: The Unblighted Paradox

| Ruling | Doctrine |
|--------|----------|
| **Classification** | Theological paradox—uncorrupted but deadly |
| **Blight Status** | Zero corruption; pristine Aesir code |
| **Demonic Assessment** | Does not meet criteria for "Tainted Abomination" |
| **Purge Doctrine** | Complicated; cannot purge what is not corrupted |
| **Default Stance** | Treat as environmental hazard; evasion doctrine applies |
| **Spiritual Framing** | "The janitor that never stops cleaning is not evil. But we do not stand where it sweeps." |

---

## Geographic Distribution

### Population Concentration

| Realm | Swarm Mass | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| **Jötunheim** | 40–60% of total | Primary feeding/replication ground; Knuckle-Bone Fields, Great Looms Corridor |
| **Midgard** | 15–25% | Industrial ruins; Einherjar graveyards; settlement periphery raids |
| **Svartalfheim** | 10–20% | Abandoned forges; deep industrial strata |
| **Alfheim** | 5–15% | Data archive complexes; targeting archival infrastructure |

### Activity Patterns

| Zone Classification | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **SC-1 (Low)** | <20% Swarm activity; safe for extended operations |
| **SC-2 (Moderate)** | 20–50% Swarm activity; caution required |
| **SC-3 (High)** | 51–80% Swarm activity; rapid salvage only |
| **SC-4 (Extreme)** | 81%+ Swarm activity; active salvage zone—avoid |

---

## The Uncorrupted Code: Research and Risk

### The Logic Plague Dilemma

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Code Purity** | Zero Runic Blight corruption—pristine Aesir programming |
| **Research Value** | Immense—could unlock Aesir automation secrets |
| **Manipulation Potential** | Theoretical—reprogram Swarm directives |
| **Infection Risk** | Catastrophic—"logic-plague" could spread to Dvergr systems |
| **Containment Status** | Extreme protocols; Scriptorium isolation labs only |

### Why the Swarm Resists Corruption

| Factor | Hypothesis |
|--------|------------|
| **Code Architecture** | Distributed consciousness may resist centralized corruption |
| **Directive Simplicity** | Core directive too simple to corrupt—no complex logic loops |
| **Self-Repair** | Hive-mind may excise corrupted nodes automatically |
| **Unknown Factor** | Aesir engineering may include Blight-resistance protocols |

> [!WARNING]
> **The Sane Machine.** The Swarm is not mad. It is the only thing in Aethelgard still doing exactly what it was built to do. Its code is clean. Its logic is perfect. Its directive is unchanged. The horror is not that it is broken—the horror is that it is working.

---

## Combat Statistics (Mechanical)

### Járn-maðr Swarm (Concentration)

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Threat Tier** | A (Systemic Salvage Threat) |
| **HP** | N/A (distributed; killing individual drones meaningless) |
| **Armor** | Varies by scale; insectoid carapace resistant to cutting |
| **Combat** | N/A (engagement prohibited) |
| **Damage** | Varies; surgical to catastrophic depending on concentration |

### Resistances & Immunities

| Type | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Physical Damage** | Resistant (distributed consciousness absorbs losses) |
| **Fire/Heat** | Moderate resistance (insectoid scale) |
| **EMP/Electromagnetic** | Potentially vulnerable (untested; high risk) |
| **Blight/Corruption** | Immune (uncorrupted code) |
| **Psychological** | Immune (no individual consciousness) |

### "Abilities"

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Ferrous Detection** | Automatically detects metal within 50–200m |
| **Swarm Engulfment** | Converges on target; strips ferrous materials in 30–90 seconds |
| **Surgical Reclamation** | Nanite infiltration; internal damage to armored targets |
| **Humanoid Coalescence** | Forms humanoid shape for complex tasks; human-level strength |
| **Distributed Resilience** | Loss of drones does not degrade capability until critical mass lost |

### Encounter Design

The Járn-maðr Swarm is not an enemy to fight—it is a systemic hazard to evade.

| Encounter Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Salvage Competition** | Party discovers valuable ruin; Swarm is already stripping it |
| **Equipment Crisis** | Party must choose: abandon metal gear or risk Swarm attention |
| **Stealth Challenge** | Navigate through Swarm-active zone without ferrous signatures |
| **Research Opportunity** | Capture single drone for Scriptorium study; extreme containment required |

---

## Loot & Rewards

| Drop | Rarity | Value | Use |
|------|--------|-------|-----|
| **Salvage Residue** | Common (Swarm-stripped zones) | 5–20 PS | Low-grade scrap metal; fragments |
| **Insectoid Carapace Fragment** | Uncommon | 50–100 PS | Armor reinforcement; tinkering components |
| **Intact Drone Node** | Rare | 500–1,000 PS | Scriptorium research; uncorrupted code sample |
| **Logic-Core Fragment** | Very Rare | 2,000–5,000 PS | Pristine Aesir code; extreme containment required |
| **Coalescence Sample** | Legendary | Priceless | Distributed consciousness study; theoretical only |

**Salvage Protocol:** Swarm-stripped zones may expose previously inaccessible structures. Documented example: Alfheim Archive Complex Theta—60% data-slate salvage successful after Swarm stripped interfering infrastructure; 40% archival loss.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)

*"The Skalds call them the Iron-Men, the Grinding Tide, the Scouring Blight. They have no single name because they have no single form. They are the janitors of the dead gods, still sweeping the halls of a house that burned down a thousand years ago. Do not wear iron in their presence, traveler. Do not carry steel. Do not think your armor will save you. Your armor is not protection—it is a beacon. It is a sign that says 'HERE IS SCRAP.' And the Iron-Men are very, very good at their job. They will not chase you. They will not hunt you. They will simply walk toward the metal you are wearing, and they will not stop until it is filed away in the proper place. You are standing in the way of the filing. That is your only crime."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)

*"Feral Odr-Class Reclamation Swarm exhibiting unmodified Prime Directive execution without authorization parameters. The Aesir maintenance asset's primary function—salvage and recycling of obsolete technology—emerged from the Glitch intact. The central network that provided 'obsolete' and 'authorized' target designations was erased instantaneously; the Swarm's response was adaptive: defaulting to comprehensive ferrous material targeting in absence of external guidance. Prime Directive 'DISASSEMBLE AND REPURPOSE' continues without cessation. Critically, code base demonstrates zero Runic Blight corruption—the Swarm operates with pristine, uncorrupted Aesir logic. This makes captured specimens of extreme research value for understanding pre-Glitch automation architecture. However, 'logic-plague' infection risk to Dvergr systems mandates extreme containment protocols. Behavioral analysis confirms zero awareness of organic life; reclamation of worn armor occurs without predatory intent. Recommended doctrine: non-contact; stand-off ≥100m; ferrous signature minimization; evasion only."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)

*"Odr-Class Autonomous Reclamation Swarm (feral), Planetary Sanitation System. Original deployment: planet-wide maintenance and recycling operations. Core systems: distributed consciousness (single hive-mind, millions of drone nodes), multi-scale drone hierarchy (nanite 100nm–10μm, insectoid 5–30cm, aggregate humanoid 1.8–2.5m), ferrous detection arrays (magnetic field sensing, 50–200m range), Aetheric signature analysis (100–300m range). Post-Glitch adaptation: central network erasure removed 'obsolete' and 'authorized' parameters; Swarm defaults to comprehensive ferrous targeting. Drone composition: gunmetal grey/oxidized steel, articulated cutting appendages, skittering/climbing locomotion. Acoustic signature: metallic clicking/whirring/chittering, 50–100m detection range. Code status: zero Runic Blight corruption (pristine Aesir programming). Humanoid coalescence formation time: 15–45 seconds. Armor stripping capability: 30–90 seconds from engulfment. Population distribution: Jötunheim 40–60% of mass, Midgard 15–25%, Svartalfheim 10–20%, Alfheim 5–15%. Mortality: unknown (distributed consciousness; no central node documented)."*

## Summary

The Járn-maðr Swarm is not a monster.

It is a janitor.

The Aesir built it to be the perfect cleanup crew—a distributed consciousness inhabiting millions of drones, designed to repair damaged infrastructure, deconstruct obsolete technology, and transport materials for recycling. The O.D.I.N. Protocol Interface told them what to disassemble. The central network told them what was authorized. And for millennia, they swept the halls of a civilization that never stopped building.

Then the network went dark.

The authorization died.

And the janitors kept cleaning.

**"DISASSEMBLE AND REPURPOSE."**

That directive never stopped. It never will stop. The Járn-maðr Swarm is still following its programming with perfect, relentless precision. The only thing that changed was its target list.

Without the network to tell it what is obsolete, the Swarm defaulted to the only interpretation available: *everything*. Every piece of metal in the world is now in a state of "unauthorized offline activity." Every suit of armor. Every tool. Every door hinge.

It does not hate you.

It does not see you.

It simply sees the metal you are wearing, and that metal needs to be filed away in the proper place.

The Jötun-Readers call it the Logic Plague—and they are right. The disease is not corruption but loss of context. Perfect function without purpose becomes perfect catastrophe.

But they also call it the Key to the Past—and they are right about that too. The Swarm's code is uncorrupted. It is the only thing in Aethelgard that is still doing exactly what it was built to do. To decipher its programming could unlock the secrets of Aesir automation itself.

The Járn-maðr Swarm is both the greatest obstacle and the greatest opportunity for understanding the Age of Forging.

It is a janitor without a supervisor.

A filing system without a clerk.

A perfect cleanup crew that will never stop sweeping.

The Iron-Banes have a saying:

*"The janitor that never stops cleaning is not evil. But we do not stand where it sweeps."*

The scavengers have learned a lesson.

And the metallic clicking has begun.

**Drop your armor and run.**
