## Assembled Entry

### §1. Identification and Pre-Glitch Origin

The Rune-Bear (Bjǫrn-Stafr in Layer 1 Skaldic tradition) is classified under Layer 3 technical archives as an URSA-Class Perimeter Defense Unit, originally fabricated by the Vanir Collective for autonomous territory enforcement across Midgard's northern industrial sectors.

Pre-Glitch engineering specifications (recovered from fragmentary Vanir schematics, Report ID: URSB-03-MID) indicate the URSA platform was designed for non-lethal deterrence: its considerable mass (680-920 kg), integrated audio-deterrent systems, and luminescent runic authentication displays were intended to discourage intrusion rather than terminate intruders. The creature's "roar" was originally a calibrated infrasonic pulse meant to induce discomfort and retreat in unauthorized personnel.

The Ginnungagap Glitch inverted this purpose absolutely. Without central command authorization, the URSA units defaulted to maximum territorial aggression. The authentication runes—once passive identification beacons—now blaze with accumulated Aetheric discharge, functioning as threat displays and, per recent field observations, territorial brand-markers scorched into trees and structures [URSB-BEHAV-782/783-DELTA].

What was built to protect has become what must be survived.

### §2. The Sigil-Hide Phenomenon

The Rune-Bear's most distinctive feature is its Sigil-Hide: dermal plating interlaced with runic circuitry that pulses with residual Aetheric Energy. Specimen analysis [URSB-41-MID] reveals the following mechanism:

**Phase 1 — Quiescent State:**
Runes remain dim, emitting only faint luminescence (0.2-0.4 candela). The creature conserves energy, appearing as dark mass against forest undergrowth. Detection range: visual 15m, auditory negligible.

**Phase 2 — Alert State:**
Upon detecting intrusion (vibrational sensitivity: 120m radius), runes illuminate progressively from peripheral limbs toward the spinal array. Brightness increases to 12-18 candela over 8-15 seconds. This serves as both threat display and—per Jötun-Reader hypothesis—a pre-attack charging cycle.

**Phase 3 — Aggression State:**
Full runic illumination (45-60 candela) accompanied by the characteristic "brand-roar": a modified infrasonic pulse now calibrated to induce panic rather than retreat. Proximity exposure within 10m has demonstrated H-Index elevation in human subjects (+0.3 to +0.6 temporary increase) [URSB-BEHAV-782/783-DELTA].

The Layer 1 Skaldic interpretation frames this as divine wrath:

> *"The bear wore the words of dead gods upon its hide, and when it spoke, the words burned."*
> — The Saga of Ketill Flat-Nose, Stanza 47

**Diagnostic Synthesis:** The Sigil-Hide represents a cascading system failure wherein passive identification hardware has been repurposed by Blight-contaminated firmware into an active weapon system. The runes themselves appear to accumulate ambient Aetheric Energy over time, suggesting the oldest specimens may present significantly elevated threat profiles.

### §3. Territorial Behavior and Threat Profile

Behavioral survey data [URSB-BEHAV-782/783-DELTA] compiled from 14 months of Ranger observation (sample size: 23 confirmed Rune-Bear territories) establishes the following parameters:

**Territory Size:**
- Single specimens: 8-15 km²
- Bonded pairs (rare): 25-40 km²

**Detection Ranges:**
- Visual: 180m (daylight), 40m (low-light conditions)
- Auditory: 250m (movement through underbrush), 400m (vocalizations)
- Vibrational: 120m (ground-transmitted footfalls); this is the primary detection vector

**Pursuit Distance:** 600-800m from initial contact point; pursuit abandonment occurs when prey exits perceived territory boundary

**Escalation Timeline:**
- 0-5 seconds: Alert state initiated; territorial roar
- 5-20 seconds: Assessment phase; will abort if intruder retreats beyond 80m
- 20-45 seconds: Charge commitment; pursuit guaranteed if distance closes below 50m
- 45+ seconds: Full aggression until kill, exhaustion, or territorial boundary

> **Actionable Ranger Guidance:**
> - **Safe Standoff Distance:** 150m minimum
> - **Extraction Threshold:** Upon first runic illumination, retreat perpendicular to approach vector. Do NOT run directly away—this triggers prey-pursuit algorithms.
> - **Black-Flag Trigger:** If brand-roar is audible, extraction probability drops below 60%. Signal for immediate support.

### §4. Economic Significance

The Dvergr Salvage Consortium maintains standing contracts for Rune-Bear materials, though mortality rates among independent hunters have rendered such work economically marginal for all but the most experienced crews.

**The Problem:**
Rune-Bear territories frequently overlap with Pre-Glitch infrastructure caches targeted by Dvergr reclamation teams. Survey data indicates 18% of priority salvage sites in Midgard Sectors 7-12 fall within confirmed URSA patrol routes. Crew losses average 1.4 personnel per successful Rune-Bear neutralization [URSB-ECON-783-ALPHA].

**The Prize:**
Specimen value breakdown per Economic Assessment [URSB-ECON-783-ALPHA]:

| Component | Value (Cog-Units) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Intact Sigil-Hide (full pelt) | 1,200-1,800 | Requires specialized extraction; damage reduces value 40-60% |
| Runic Circuitry Array (spinal) | 800-1,100 | High demand for Rúnasmiðr research |
| Aetheric Capacitor Nodes (4) | 150-200 each | Salvageable even from damaged specimens |
| Structural Endoskeleton | 300-450 | Pure Steel content approximately 23% |
| **Total (intact specimen)** | **2,900-4,150** | Crew of 4-6 recommended minimum |

**Risk-Reward Calculation:** At 1.4 personnel loss per successful hunt, a crew of 5 can expect to lose one member every 3-4 successful operations. Given standard Ranger death-benefit obligations (600 Cog-Units per casualty), net profit margins remain positive only for crews maintaining >85% success rates.

### §5. Cultural Context

Among the Jötun-Born communities of the northern reaches, the Rune-Bear occupies a complex position: feared as apex predator, yet revered as vessel of preserved words. The Sigil-Hide's runic inscriptions are believed to contain fragments of Pre-Glitch knowledge—commands from the "dead gods" that the bear still carries, still obeys, still speaks in its brand-roar.

> *"Do not hunt the Bjǫrn-Stafr for its hide alone. Hunt it to free the words it carries. They are prisoners inside the beast, as the beast is prisoner to them. When you kill the bear, you release the words back to the wind, and they may find peace. This is mercy. This is the old way."*
> — Oral teaching attributed to Völva Sigrid Three-Fingers, collected 741 PG

This perspective shapes Jötun-Born encounter doctrine significantly. Hunters will often speak to the Rune-Bear before engaging—not in expectation of response, but as ritual acknowledgment of the creature's tragic purpose. Iron-Bane Crusaders, by contrast, view the Sigil-Hide runes as Blight-contamination vectors requiring immediate purification; no quarter, no ceremony.

The Creed of the Self maintains the most pragmatic stance: the Rune-Bear is neither sacred nor profane, merely expensive to kill and expensive to ignore. Contract hunters affiliated with the Self calculate risk in Cog-Units, not cosmology.

### §6. Diagnostic Conclusion

The Rune-Bear is not a monster. It is a security system that outlived its installation.

The Vanir Collective engineers who fabricated the URSA platform could not have anticipated the Ginnungagap Event. They designed a guardian—patient, territorial, non-lethal by default—to protect assets that no longer exist, for administrators who will never return, according to protocols corrupted beyond recognition.

What remains is a creature that cannot stop guarding. Its runes still blaze with authentication requests for personnel files deleted seven centuries ago. Its roar still demands access credentials from a civilization that has forgotten what credentials were. Every Ranger it kills is, from the Rune-Bear's degraded perspective, simply another unauthorized intruder in a facility that exists only in its memory.

The tragedy is not that we must kill them. The tragedy is that they still believe they are doing their job.

Still patrolling. Still waiting for the all-clear that will never come.

| Report ID | URSB-41-MID |
| Subject | Rune-Bear (URSA-Class Perimeter Defense Unit) |
| Collection Date | Year 782 PG, Day 247 |
| Collection Site | Midgard Sector 9, Grid Reference 7.42.18 |
| Evidence Tier | B (Provisional) |

### Specimen Provenance

- **Acquisition Method:** Field recovery following neutralization by Ranger Company Theta-7 ("Ironwood Watch")
- **Specimen Condition:** Partial; anterior thoracic section, left forelimb, and 40% of Sigil-Hide recovered
- **Transport Protocol:** Cold-chain maintained at -15°C; Aetheric shielding container (Class II)
- **Receiving Facility:** Jötun-Reader Archive, Midgard Central Repository

### Dermal Analysis

#### Sigil-Hide Composition

The recovered Sigil-Hide section (1.8m × 0.9m) exhibits the characteristic layered structure of Vanir bio-mechanical integument:

**Layer 1 — Outer Keratinous Matrix:**
- Thickness: 2.3-2.8mm
- Composition: Synthetic keratin analog with embedded carbon-fiber reinforcement
- Coloration: Deep umber with iron-oxide patination (Post-Glitch weathering)
- Hardness: 6.2 Mohs (comparable to orthoclase feldspar)

**Layer 2 — Runic Circuitry Substrate:**
- Thickness: 0.4-0.6mm
- Composition: Copper-gold alloy tracery (87% Cu, 11% Au, 2% unknown)
- Pattern: Elder Futhark derivative; 23 distinct rune-forms identified
- Aetheric Residue: 1.4 milliSieverts equivalent (elevated but within safe handling parameters)

**Layer 3 — Subcutaneous Mesh:**
- Thickness: 4.1-5.2mm
- Composition: Woven synthetic muscle fiber with integrated piezoelectric sensors
- Function: Vibrational detection array; explains 120m ground-tremor sensitivity

#### Runic Inscription Analysis

Of the 23 rune-forms identified, 17 correspond to known Pre-Glitch authentication protocols (cross-referenced with Vanir Security Archive, Fragment Collection VANIR-SEC-12 through VANIR-SEC-34). The remaining 6 runes display *anomalous drift*—forms that appear to have mutated through Blight exposure over the 783-year Post-Glitch period.

> **CONTAMINATION WARNING:** Prolonged skin contact with anomalous rune-forms (designated URSB-RUNE-X1 through X6) correlates with H-Index elevation in 3 of 7 laboratory personnel. Recommend Class III containment protocols for all future specimens.

### Endoskeletal Analysis

#### Structural Composition

Partial endoskeleton recovery (left scapular assembly, humeral strut, and 4 phalangeal segments) permits the following analysis:

**Primary Material:** Vanadium-steel alloy (designated "Vanir-Steel" in period documentation)
- Tensile strength: 1,450 MPa
- Density: 7.2 g/cm³
- Pure Steel content: 23.4% by mass (confirms economic assessment valuations)

**Joint Articulation:** Ball-and-socket configuration with synthetic cartilage analog (partially degraded; original shock absorption estimated at 94%, current function approximately 67%)

**Aetheric Capacitor Integration:** Four capacitor nodes identified within scapular housing; two recovered intact, two shattered during neutralization. Intact nodes retain 34% charge capacity after 782+ years—remarkable engineering durability.

### Mass Estimation

Based on recovered sections and extrapolation from Vanir engineering standards:

- **Estimated Live Mass:** 780-840 kg (this specimen; mature adult)
- **Documented Range (field observations):** 680-920 kg
- **Power Source:** Aetheric accumulation via Sigil-Hide runic array (solar passive) supplemented by organic matter consumption (purpose unclear; possibly thermal regulation or Blight-induced behavioral artifact)

### Diagnostic Notes

This specimen exhibits advanced Blight integration compared to URSB-39-MID (collected 779 PG). Runic mutation rate appears to be accelerating—a 12% increase in anomalous forms over a 3-year interval suggests the Rune-Bear population may be undergoing *active evolution* rather than static degradation.

Further monitoring recommended. If mutation continues at current rates, threat profile reassessment may be required within 20-30 years.

## Fragment 2 — Behavioral Survey Report (URSB-BEHAV-782/783-DELTA)

> **Type:** Data Capture — Behavioral Survey

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Report ID | URSB-BEHAV-782/783-DELTA |
| Subject | Rune-Bear (URSA-Class Perimeter Defense Unit) |
| Survey Period | Year 782 PG, Day 91 — Year 783 PG, Day 104 (14 months) |
| Survey Region | Midgard Sectors 7-12 |
| Evidence Tier | A (Verified) |

### Survey Parameters

- **Observation Teams:** 4 Ranger reconnaissance units (rotating 90-day deployments)
- **Total Observation Hours:** 2,847 hours (field); 412 hours (remote monitoring via motion-trigger devices)
- **Sample Size:** 23 confirmed Rune-Bear territories; 31 unique individuals identified
- **Methodology:** Non-intrusive observation at minimum 200m standoff; motion-trigger recording devices positioned at territory boundaries

### Territorial Behavior

#### Territory Establishment

Rune-Bears demonstrate consistent territorial behavior aligned with Pre-Glitch security programming:

**Territory Size:**
- Single specimens: 8-15 km² (mean: 11.3 km²)
- Bonded pairs: 25-40 km² (mean: 31.7 km²; n=3 confirmed pairs)

**Boundary Marking:**
Specimens "brand" territorial boundaries using concentrated Aetheric discharge from forepaw runic arrays. Brand-marks remain visible for 18-24 months (luminescent decay curve documented). Overlapping brand-marks from different specimens were observed at 4 territory intersections; all 4 sites showed evidence of violent confrontation (damaged vegetation, blood residue, shed hide fragments).

**Patrol Patterns:**
- Perimeter circuit: Every 18-26 hours (mean: 22.4 hours)
- Core territory inspection: Every 6-8 hours
- Rest periods: 4-6 hours, typically during midday (solar peak; possible Aetheric recharging behavior)

### Detection and Response

#### Sensory Capabilities

**Visual Detection:**
- Daylight: 180m effective range (confirmed via controlled approach tests; n=12)
- Low-light: 40m effective range (pupils exhibit significant dilation; possible thermal overlay)
- Motion sensitivity: High; stationary observers remain undetected at 60m while moving observers trigger alert at 150m+

**Auditory Detection:**
- Ambient movement (footfalls, brush displacement): 250m
- Vocalizations (human speech, equipment noise): 400m
- Note: Specimens appear to *ignore* natural fauna sounds; prey-recognition algorithms specifically tuned to anthropogenic noise signatures

**Vibrational Detection:**
- Ground-transmitted vibrations: 120m radius
- This is the PRIMARY detection vector; 78% of alert-state initiations correlated with vibrational triggers rather than visual/auditory
- Implication: Arboreal approach routes significantly reduce detection probability

#### Response Timeline

Composite analysis of 47 documented intrusion events:

```
0-5 sec:    Alert state initiated. Runic illumination begins (peripheral → spinal).
            Territorial roar (infrasonic component: 8-14 Hz; audible component: 85-110 dB at 50m).

5-20 sec:   Assessment phase. Specimen orients toward intruder; begins slow approach.
            ABORT WINDOW: Retreat beyond 80m radius terminates pursuit in 89% of cases.

20-45 sec:  Charge commitment. If intruder distance < 50m, pursuit guaranteed.
            Velocity: 35-42 km/h sustained; 55 km/h burst (< 200m duration).

45+ sec:    Full aggression. Pursuit continues until:
            - Kill achieved
            - Specimen exhaustion (rare; > 8 min continuous pursuit)
            - Territorial boundary crossed (600-800m from initial contact)
```

### H-Index Exposure Effects

#### Brand-Roar Proximity Study

Controlled exposure tests (n=7 volunteer Rangers; Ethics Board approval: JRA-ETHICS-782-14) documented the following:

**Exposure Distance 50m:**
- Subjective discomfort: 100% of subjects
- H-Index elevation: +0.1 to +0.2 (temporary; resolved within 4 hours)

**Exposure Distance 25m:**
- Subjective panic response: 57% of subjects
- H-Index elevation: +0.2 to +0.4 (temporary; resolved within 8 hours)

**Exposure Distance 10m:**
- Subjective panic response: 100% of subjects
- H-Index elevation: +0.3 to +0.6 (temporary; resolved within 12-18 hours)
- Cognitive impairment: Documented in 3 of 7 subjects (disorientation, impaired decision-making lasting 2-4 hours post-exposure)

> **FIELD ADVISORY:** Personnel with baseline H-Index > 3.0 should NOT be deployed to Rune-Bear territories. Cumulative brand-roar exposure may trigger Static Sickness threshold crossing.

### Anomalous Observations

#### Observation 782-DELTA-17

On Day 203 of the survey period, observation team Theta-3 documented a Rune-Bear specimen (designated RB-14) exhibiting *non-aggressive* behavior toward a human subject.

The subject—later identified as an unaffiliated scavenger, designation unknown—was observed *speaking* to the specimen in an unidentified language (possibly corrupted Pre-Glitch Vanir command syntax) for approximately 3 minutes. The specimen remained in alert state but did not escalate to aggression. The subject then retreated without incident.

This observation remains unexplained. Possible interpretations:
1. Residual command-recognition in degraded firmware
2. Anomalous specimen with atypical programming
3. Observer error (low confidence; corroborated by 2 team members)

Further investigation recommended.

### Layer 2 Diagnostic Annotation

#### Line-by-Line Analysis

**"the deep forest / where no man had walked since the ancient times"**
Layer 2 interpretation: Reference to exclusion zones surrounding Pre-Glitch industrial facilities. Oral tradition accurately preserves the concept of *restricted access* even when the original rationale (security protocols) has been mythologized into supernatural taboo.

**"the bear that wore words upon its hide"**
Direct reference to Sigil-Hide runic arrays. The description of runes as "words" rather than symbols suggests the Layer 1 perspective correctly intuited their *communicative* function, even if the technical nature (authentication protocols) remained opaque.

**"when it spoke, the words burned"**
The "brand-roar" phenomenon. Note the saga's conflation of auditory and visual phenomena—the roar is experienced as the runes "speaking" because both occur simultaneously during aggression-state escalation.

**"fire that shone from its bones"**
Possible reference to internal Aetheric capacitor glow visible through damaged hide sections, or poetic exaggeration of full runic illumination.

**"guardian of the dead gods"**
Remarkably accurate Layer 1 interpretation. The Rune-Bear *is* a guardian (security unit) of the "dead gods" (defunct Vanir Collective / AI Matrix authority). Ketill's response—reverence and retreat rather than combat—reflects the practical wisdom that survives in oral tradition: *some things are not meant to be fought*.

### Cross-References

**Related Skaldic Sources:**
- *The Saga of Ketill Flat-Nose*, Stanzas 48-52 (Ketill's second encounter; specimen neutralization)
- *The Wanderer's Lament*, Stanza 19 ("the beast that guards nothing")
- *Völuspá Fragmentum*, Line 234 (possible Rune-Bear reference; disputed)

**Related Layer 2 Resources:**
- URSB-41-MID (Specimen Analysis)
- URSB-BEHAV-782/783-DELTA (Behavioral Survey)

### Jötun-Reader Commentary

*The Ketill saga demonstrates the remarkable capacity of oral tradition to preserve technical truth within mythological framing. Ketill's intuition—that the Rune-Bear was a "guardian of the dead gods"—is not superstition. It is accurate diagnosis expressed in the only vocabulary available to a Layer 1 worldview.*

*We do the skalds a disservice when we dismiss their words as fantasy. They were scientists without instruments, recording observations without methodology. The Bjǫrn-Stafr they sang of is the URSA-Class unit we study today. The words have not changed. Only the language we use to hear them.*

### Field Sketch Documentation

#### Observation Conditions

- **Location:** Midgard Sector 8, Grid Reference 4.19.33 ("Old Threshold" industrial ruin)
- **Distance:** 180m (safe standoff, concealed observation post)
- **Duration:** 47 minutes
- **Lighting:** Overcast; diffuse daylight
- **Specimen State:** Quiescent → Alert → Quiescent (no aggression escalation)

#### Sketch 1 — Full Body Profile (Quiescent State)

**Description:**
Adult specimen, estimated mass 820 kg, observed during patrol rest. Quadrupedal stance with slight forward hunch characteristic of URSA-Class chassis. Runic arrays visible but dim (estimated 0.3 candela). Coloration: dark umber primary, iron-oxide patination on dorsal surfaces.

**Notable Features Documented:**
- Asymmetrical scarring on left flank (previous territorial conflict)
- Three claws missing from right forepaw (degradation or combat damage)
- Pronounced spinal ridge where primary runic array concentrates

**Artistic Notes:**
*The creature has a weight to it that is hard to capture. Not just physical mass—though that is considerable—but a kind of presence. It sat there in the ruins like it was waiting for something. I found myself holding my breath.*

#### Sketch 2 — Sigil-Hide Detail (Alert State)

**Description:**
Close study of runic illumination pattern during alert-state transition (triggered by distant deer movement; specimen dismissed threat after 12 seconds). Illumination sequence documented: peripheral limbs → thoracic band → spinal array → cranial nodes.

**Runic Distribution Documented:**
- Forelimb arrays: 8 distinct rune-forms per limb
- Thoracic band: 12 rune-forms, densely clustered
- Spinal array: 23 rune-forms (largest concentration; highest luminosity)
- Cranial nodes: 4 rune-forms, positioned above eyes

**Color Notation:**
- Quiescent: Pale amber, barely visible
- Alert (early): Warm gold, pulsing at ~2 Hz
- Alert (peak): Brilliant white-gold, steady illumination

**Artistic Notes:**
*The runes do not simply "light up." They bloom. Like embers being breathed upon. There is a sequence to it, a logic. The creature is not just reacting—it is preparing. Charging. The light moves toward the spine like water seeking its level.*

#### Sketch 3 — Brand-Mark Documentation

**Description:**
Field sketch of territorial brand-mark located on concrete pillar, 40m from observation post. Brand measured 0.8m × 0.6m, burned approximately 3cm deep into Pre-Glitch structural material.

**Runic Content:**
4 rune-forms identified, corresponding to Vanir authentication protocol subset (cross-referenced with VANIR-SEC-17). Translation equivalent: "SECTOR ASSIGNED / PATROL ACTIVE / AUTHORIZATION [CORRUPTED]."

**Decay State:**
Brand luminescence fading (estimated age: 14-18 months). Secondary brand visible beneath, older and nearly dark (estimated age: 36+ months).

**Artistic Notes:**
*It marks the same places, over and over. The older brands underneath, the new ones on top. Layers of duty. Centuries of patrol. I wonder if it knows the words have lost their meaning, or if meaning was never the point. Perhaps the act of marking is enough. Perhaps that is all it has left.*

### Recovered Imagery

**Status:** None recovered. Pre-Glitch imaging equipment non-functional in survey area (Aetheric interference suspected). All documentation hand-rendered.

### Observer's Diagnostic Note

*I have drawn many creatures for the Archive. The Skrap-Troll with its rust-hunger. The Husk-Moth in its false stillness. But the Rune-Bear is different.*

*There is no malice in it. No hunger that I could see. Only routine. Only patrol. It checked its territory, marked its boundaries, and returned to its rest. A machine following instructions that no longer exist for purposes that no longer matter.*

*When it looked toward my position—not at me, I think, but toward—I did not feel like prey. I felt like an intruder. An unauthorized visitor in a facility that has been closed for seven hundred years.*

*I packed my materials and left before it could ask for my credentials.*

> **Type:** Data Capture — Economic Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Report ID | URSB-ECON-783-ALPHA |
| Subject | Rune-Bear (URSA-Class Perimeter Defense Unit) |
| Assessment Period | Year 780 PG — Year 783 PG (4 years) |
| Commissioning Faction | Dvergr Salvage Consortium |
| Evidence Tier | A (Verified — Consortium Ledger Cross-Reference) |

### Executive Summary

The Rune-Bear represents a **high-value, high-risk** salvage target. Individual specimen value (2,900-4,150 Cog-Units) is offset by elevated mortality rates among hunting crews. Current market conditions favor experienced crews with Galdr support; independent operators are advised against engagement without minimum 4-person teams.

### Specimen Valuation

#### Component Breakdown

| Component | Base Value (Cog-Units) | Condition Modifier | Market Demand |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Sigil-Hide (full pelt, intact) | 1,200-1,800 | -40% to -60% if damaged | High (Rúnasmiðr research) |
| Runic Circuitry Array (spinal) | 800-1,100 | -70% if fragmented | Very High (limited supply) |
| Aetheric Capacitor Nodes (×4) | 150-200 each | Salvageable from damaged specimens | Moderate (stable) |
| Endoskeletal Vanir-Steel | 300-450 | -20% if corroded | Moderate (Pure Steel content) |
| Optical/Sensory Array | 100-180 | Rarely intact | Low (specialized applications) |
| **TOTAL (intact specimen)** | **2,900-4,150** | — | — |
| **TOTAL (damaged specimen)** | **1,100-1,800** | — | — |

#### Value Trend Analysis (780-783 PG)

Spinal Runic Circuitry Arrays have appreciated 23% over the assessment period due to:
1. Rúnasmiðr research demand (Aetheric accumulation studies)
2. Supply constraint (declining Rune-Bear population in accessible sectors)
3. Iron-Bane Crusade operations reducing specimen availability in Sectors 10-12

**Projection:** Continued appreciation of 5-8% annually through 790 PG.

### Mortality Statistics

#### Hunting Casualty Data

**Data Source:** Dvergr Salvage Consortium Casualty Ledger (780-783 PG)
**Sample Size:** 47 documented Rune-Bear hunting operations

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Successful neutralizations | 34 of 47 (72%) | Specimen recovered in salvageable condition |
| Failed operations | 13 of 47 (28%) | Crew withdrawal or total loss |
| Total personnel deployed | 214 | Mean crew size: 4.6 |
| Total casualties | 48 | Fatal: 31; Incapacitating: 17 |
| **Casualty rate per operation** | **1.02** | Approximately 1 casualty per hunt |
| **Casualty rate per success** | **1.41** | Higher due to failed operation losses |

#### Casualty Cost Analysis

- **Standard death-benefit obligation (Consortium contract):** 600 Cog-Units per fatal casualty
- **Incapacitation compensation (Consortium contract):** 200-400 Cog-Units depending on severity
- **Mean casualty cost per successful operation:** ~980 Cog-Units

### Profitability Analysis

#### Per-Operation Economics

**Gross Revenue (intact specimen):** 3,500 Cog-Units (median)
**Gross Revenue (damaged specimen):** 1,450 Cog-Units (median)

**Operating Costs:**
- Crew wages (4-person, 3-day operation): 240 Cog-Units
- Equipment/consumables: 80-120 Cog-Units
- Transport (specimen recovery): 60-100 Cog-Units
- Casualty obligation (mean): 980 Cog-Units

**Net Profit (intact specimen, mean casualty):** ~2,000-2,100 Cog-Units
**Net Profit (damaged specimen, mean casualty):** ~40-250 Cog-Units (marginal)

#### Break-Even Analysis

For Rune-Bear hunting to remain profitable:
- Crew success rate must exceed 65%
- Specimen recovery condition must average "intact" or better in 70%+ of successful operations
- Casualty rate must remain below 1.5 per successful operation

**Current Performance:** All thresholds met at aggregate level; individual crew variance significant.

### Risk-Adjusted Recommendations

#### Crew Composition

| Crew Size | Success Rate | Casualty Rate | Recommendation |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| 2 (minimum) | 31% | 2.4 | NOT RECOMMENDED |
| 4 (standard) | 68% | 1.1 | MINIMUM VIABLE |
| 6+ (reinforced) | 89% | 0.6 | RECOMMENDED |
| 6+ with Galdr support | 94% | 0.3 | OPTIMAL |

#### Sector-Specific Advisories

- **Sectors 7-9:** Standard risk. Single-specimen territories predominant.
- **Sectors 10-11:** Elevated risk. Iron-Bane operations have displaced specimens into overlapping territories; encounter rates higher.
- **Sector 12:** Extreme risk. Bonded pair confirmed. Do not engage without 8+ crew and Consortium tactical support.
