# One-Handed Melee Weapons

## A. Axes (One-Handed)

| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Examples | Hand axe, bearded axe, boarding axe, throwing hatchet |
| Base Damage | 2d10 + MIGHT |
| Range | Melee |
| Hands Required | One |
| Special Properties | [Throwable] — Can be thrown at Short range (one zone) |
| Proficiency Required | Axes Proficiency |
| Governing Attribute | MIGHT |

**Common Names (Layer 1):** Rust-Biter, Scrap-Cleaver, Iron Fang, The Chopper

**Diagnostic Notes:** The axe remains the most common weapon in Aethelgard due to its dual utility—a tool for salvage work that doubles as a lethal armament. Rust-Clan salvagers universally carry hand axes; the weapon's chopping motion translates directly from cutting cable bundles to cutting threats. The throwing capability provides limited ranged options for primarily melee-focused combatants.

| Example Weapon | Tier | Damage | Value (PS) | Special |
|----------------|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Rust-Cutter (Jury-Rigged) | 0 | 1d10 + MIGHT | 8 PS | Unreliable; 10% jam chance per combat |
| Salvager's Hatchet (Scavenged) | 1 | 2d10 + MIGHT | 35 PS | Standard; +1 to salvage checks |
| Ironfast Bearded Axe (Clan-Forged) | 2 | 2d10 + MIGHT | 120 PS | +1 MIGHT when used two-handed |
| Dvergr Work-Axe (Dvergr-Forged) | 3 | 2d10+2 + MIGHT | 350 PS | Cannot rust; +2 to salvage checks |
| Skull-Splitter (Myth-Forged) | 5 | 3d10 + MIGHT | 4,500 PS | [Throwable] returns to hand; critical hits cause [Bleeding] |

## B. Swords (One-Handed)

| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Examples | Arming sword, saber, cutlass, seax, short sword |
| Base Damage | 2d10 + MIGHT |
| Range | Melee |
| Hands Required | One |
| Special Properties | [Versatile] — +1d10 damage if wielded two-handed |
| Proficiency Required | Swords Proficiency |
| Governing Attribute | MIGHT |

**Common Names (Layer 1):** Clan-Blade, Honor-Edge, The Oath-Keeper, Steel-Tongue

**Diagnostic Notes:** Swords occupy a higher status than axes in Aethelgardian martial culture—they require more sophisticated metallurgy and represent deliberate weapon manufacture rather than adapted tools. The [Versatile] property allows tactical flexibility: grip with both hands for power strikes, or pair with a shield for defensive combat. Rangers Guild personnel favor swords for their balance between offense and defense during patrol operations.

| Example Weapon | Tier | Damage | Value (PS) | Special |
|----------------|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Scrap-Blade (Jury-Rigged) | 0 | 1d10 + MIGHT | 12 PS | Prone to chipping; -1 damage after 3 combats |
| Salvaged Seax (Scavenged) | 1 | 2d10 + MIGHT | 50 PS | Standard; compact for close quarters |
| Hearthguard Arming Sword (Clan-Forged) | 2 | 2d10 + MIGHT | 180 PS | [Versatile]; balanced for parrying |
| Dvergr Cavalry Saber (Dvergr-Forged) | 3 | 2d10+2 + MIGHT | 420 PS | [Versatile]; +1 Defense when parrying |
| Oathbinder (Myth-Forged) | 5 | 3d10+2 + MIGHT | 6,200 PS | [Versatile]; wounds inflicted resist healing; bearer immune to [Fear] |

## C. Maces & Hammers (One-Handed)

| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Examples | Mace, war hammer, flail, morning star, club |
| Base Damage | 2d10 + MIGHT |
| Range | Melee |
| Hands Required | One |
| Special Properties | [Armor Penetration] — Ignores 2 Soak (crushing damage) |
| Proficiency Required | Hammers Proficiency |
| Governing Attribute | MIGHT |

**Common Names (Layer 1):** Skull-Cracker, Iron Argument, The Convincer, Bone-Breaker

**Diagnostic Notes:** Crushing weapons excel against armored targets—the [Armor Penetration] property represents the physics of blunt trauma transmitting through rigid protection. Iron-Bane crusaders favor maces and hammers for their symbolic resonance (the hammer that shatters the machine) and practical effectiveness against Undying automata (crushing damage disrupts mechanical joints more effectively than cutting). The flail variant adds unpredictable strike angles but requires additional training.

| Example Weapon | Tier | Damage | Value (PS) | Special |
|----------------|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Pipe-Club (Jury-Rigged) | 0 | 1d10 + MIGHT | 5 PS | Improvised; no special properties |
| Salvaged Mace (Scavenged) | 1 | 2d10 + MIGHT | 40 PS | [Armor Penetration: 2 Soak] |
| Hearth-Hammer (Clan-Forged) | 2 | 2d10 + MIGHT | 150 PS | [Armor Penetration: 2 Soak]; +1 vs. Constructs |
| Dvergr War-Hammer (Dvergr-Forged) | 3 | 2d10+2 + MIGHT | 380 PS | [Armor Penetration: 3 Soak]; can destroy shields |
| Jötun-Breaker (Myth-Forged) | 5 | 3d10+3 + MIGHT | 7,800 PS | [Armor Penetration: 4 Soak]; critical hits cause [Stunned]; +3 vs. Automata |

## D. Daggers

| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Examples | Dagger, knife, stiletto, dirk, seax-knife |
| Base Damage | 1d10 + FINESSE |
| Range | Melee |
| Hands Required | One |
| Special Properties | [Throwable] — Can be thrown at Short range; [Concealable] — +3 to hide weapon; [Precision Strike] — +2d10 damage on stealth attacks |
| Proficiency Required | Daggers Proficiency (Universal — all archetypes proficient) |
| Governing Attribute | FINESSE |

**Common Names (Layer 1):** Throat-Tickler, Shadow's Kiss, The Quiet Argument, Mercy-Blade

**Diagnostic Notes:** The dagger serves as universal sidearm across all Aethelgardian cultures—every traveler, salvager, and soldier carries at least one. Lower base damage is offset by universal proficiency (no training penalty), excellent concealment, and devastating effectiveness in ambush situations. The [Precision Strike] bonus reflects anatomical targeting enabled by the weapon's precision; this bonus applies only when the target is unaware of the attacker.

| Example Weapon | Tier | Damage | Value (PS) | Special |
|----------------|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Scrap-Shiv (Jury-Rigged) | 0 | 1d6 + FINESSE | 3 PS | Improvised; breaks on critical failure |
| Salvager's Knife (Scavenged) | 1 | 1d10 + FINESSE | 25 PS | Standard utility blade |
| Clan-Forged Dirk (Clan-Forged) | 2 | 1d10+1 + FINESSE | 90 PS | [Precision Strike: +2d10]; balanced for throwing |
| Dvergr Stiletto (Dvergr-Forged) | 3 | 1d10+2 + FINESSE | 220 PS | [Precision Strike: +3d10]; ignores 1 Soak |
| Shadow's Edge (Myth-Forged) | 5 | 2d10+3 + FINESSE | 3,800 PS | [Precision Strike: +4d10]; inflicts [Bleeding]; +4 FINESSE |

## E. Spears (One-Handed)

| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Examples | Short spear, javelin, hunting spear |
| Base Damage | 2d10 + MIGHT |
| Range | Melee |
| Hands Required | One |
| Special Properties | [Throwable] — Can be thrown at Medium range (two zones); [Reach] — Can attack from Back Row in formation |
| Proficiency Required | Polearms Proficiency |
| Governing Attribute | MIGHT |

**Common Names (Layer 1):** Trail-Prod, Beast-Sticker, The Long Arm, Fang-on-a-Stick

**Diagnostic Notes:** The one-handed spear represents the most ancient weapon design still in common use—a pointed implement on a shaft. Rangers Guild patrol units favor spears for their versatility: effective in melee, throwable at medium range, and functional as walking staves during overland travel. The [Reach] property allows spear-wielders to strike from the second rank of a formation, enabling tactical depth.

| Example Weapon | Tier | Damage | Value (PS) | Special |
|----------------|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Sharpened Pipe (Jury-Rigged) | 0 | 1d10 + MIGHT | 6 PS | Improvised; prone to bending |
| Salvaged Javelin (Scavenged) | 1 | 2d10 + MIGHT | 30 PS | [Throwable: Medium]; disposable |
| Ranger's Trail-Spear (Clan-Forged) | 2 | 2d10 + MIGHT | 110 PS | [Reach]; [Throwable]; +1 to tracking |
| Dvergr Hunting Lance (Dvergr-Forged) | 3 | 2d10+2 + MIGHT | 290 PS | [Reach]; [Throwable]; +2 vs. Beasts |
| Gungnir's Echo (Myth-Forged) | 5 | 3d10+2 + MIGHT | 8,500 PS | [Reach]; [Throwable: Long]; returns when thrown; never misses ranged target |
