## Core Identity

**Radical Self-Reliance I** represents survival skills learned through bitter experience. Years of solitary survival have taught you what keeps you alive: **reading tracks, finding food, navigating wastes**. What takes others years, you know instinctively.

---

## Mechanics

### Always Active

- **+1d10** to Wasteland Survival (Tracking)
- **+1d10** to Wasteland Survival (Foraging)
- Stacks with skill ranks (total: up to 7d10!)

### Rank Progression

| Rank | PP Cost | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | +1d10 to Tracking and Foraging |
| 2 | 20 | +2d10 to each |
| 3 | 35 | +3d10 to each + auto-success on routine checks |

---

## Tactical Applications

**Master Tracker (Rank 2):**

```
Base: WITS 3 = 3d10
Wasteland Survival +3: +3d10
Radical Self-Reliance I (Rank 2): +2d10
Total: 8d10 → Difficult DC 18 achievable
```

**Synergies:**

- **Live off the Land:** Automatic herbs + tracking bonuses
- **Resourceful Eye:** Find hidden resource nodes
- **Party sustainability:** Keep everyone fed and supplied

## Failure Modes

<aside>
⚠️

**Dice Variance** — Even 8d10 pools can roll catastrophically (~0.0001%). Carry backup rations regardless of expertise.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Tracking Wrong Target** — High success reads prints accurately but doesn't guarantee threat assessment. Can track toward danger unknowingly.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Contaminated Forage** — Finds food but doesn't guarantee safety in Blighted environments. Combine with Wasteland Wanderer's resistance.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️

**Environmental Limits** — Heavy rain, sandstorms, hard stone floors leave no trackable sign. Expertise useless without physical evidence.
