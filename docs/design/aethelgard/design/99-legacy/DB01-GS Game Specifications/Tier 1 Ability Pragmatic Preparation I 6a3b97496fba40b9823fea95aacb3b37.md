## Core Identity

**Pragmatic Preparation I** embodies the Hlekkr-master's philosophy: trust well-maintained tools, not hope. A sharp hook, reliable chain, and practiced technique are your foundation in a glitching world. This passive enhances your trap-work and extends the duration of all your control effects.

## Mechanics

### Always Active (Passive)

**Trap Mastery:**

- +1d10 bonus to FINESSE checks for setting/disarming traps

**Extended Control:**

- All your [Rooted] and [Slowed] effects last **+1 turn** longer

### Rank Progression

| Rank | PP Cost | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | +1d10 trap checks; control effects +1 turn |
| 2 | 20 | +2d10 trap checks |
| 3 | 35 | +3d10 trap checks; control effects +2 turns total |

## Tactical Applications

**Duration Stacking:**

```jsx
Netting Shot base: [Rooted] 2 turns
With Pragmatic Prep Rank 1: [Rooted] 3 turns
With Pragmatic Prep Rank 3: [Rooted] 4 turns

Result: Nearly half a combat of immobility
```

**Trap Specialist:**

```jsx
Base FINESSE check: 1d20 + modifier
With Rank 3: 1d20 + 3d10 + modifier

Result: Near-guaranteed trap success
```

**Synergies:**

- **Netting Shot:** [Rooted] duration extended
- **Chain Scythe:** [Slowed] duration extended
- **Punish the Helpless:** Longer control = more damage windows
