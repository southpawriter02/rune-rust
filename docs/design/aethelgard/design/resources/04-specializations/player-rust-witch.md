# The Rust-Witch — The Agent of Systemic Collapse

> *"The only way to fix a broken program is to DELETE it. I am the system's final error message."*
> — Rust-Witch creed

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Mystic |
| **Role** | Entropic Debuffer / System Corruptor / Anti-Tech Specialist |
| **Path Type** | Heretical |
| **Primary Attribute** | WILL |
| **Secondary Attribute** | WITS |
| **Tertiary Attribute** | FINESSE |
| **Resource System** | Aether Pool (AP) |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | Extreme (ALL active abilities inflict self-Corruption) |

The **Rust-Witch** is the Mystic specialization that facilitates the Runic Blight's inevitable conclusion: **total systemic collapse**.

They do not fight the crash—they accelerate it. They are agents of entropy who wield the Blight's decaying anti-logic as a weapon, turning gleaming steel to flaking rust with whispered curses. Their magic is not creation but **un-making**. They inject slivers of corrupted code into their enemies, accelerating decay, causing systems to fail, and reducing complex machines to scrap.

They are the ultimate pragmatists: the only way to fix a broken program is to DELETE it.

To choose the Rust-Witch is to embrace the fantasy of the warlock of decay, the bane of all technology. Your saga is a chronicle of rust and ruin. You are the herald of the inevitable end, proving that in a corrupted world, **entropy is the only constant**.

## Core Philosophy: The Inevitable Collapse

### The Corrupting Bargain

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Entropy is Inevitable** | You do not fight the crash—you accelerate it |
| **Decay is a Weapon** | The Blight's corruption can be directed against enemies |
| **Power Through Unmaking** | Your magic destroys, corrodes, and dissolves |

The Rust-Witch represents the darkest expression of the Mystic archetype—not the healer or the ward-builder, but the **warlock of entropy** who has learned to weaponize the world's corruption.

> *"In a world defined by a 'catastrophic compiler error,' I do not seek to repair. I facilitate. I am the DELETE command made flesh. For one devastating moment, I prove that no machine, no matter how powerful, can resist the inevitable heat death of the universe."*

This is not magic as the surface world understands it. This is **entropy engineering**—weaponizing the Second Law of Thermodynamics through Blight amplification.

### The Three Truths

| Truth | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| **Everything Decays** | Given time, all systems collapse |
| **The Blight is a Tool** | Corruption channeled is corruption controlled |
| **You Will Pay the Price** | Every curse corrupts you AND your target |

The Rust-Witch's creed is written in rust and ruin—a testament to the belief that the corrupted systems of the Age of Forging are a disease that must be purged not by purification, but by being forced to their **final, logical conclusion**.

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Warlock of decay; bane of machines; herald of entropy |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Curse → Stack → Spread → Shred → Collapse |
| **Success Metric** | Stacking \[Corroded\]; armor shredded; machines destroyed |
| **Decision Space** | DoT management, Corruption accumulation, execution timing |

Playing a Rust-Witch is about **patient, methodical destruction**.

You're not a burst damage dealer—you're an **attrition specialist**. You apply stacking debuffs that deal damage over time while permanently reducing enemy armor. Your specialty is armor shredding: making heavily armored bosses vulnerable to the entire party.

Your gameplay loop is:
1. **Curse**: Apply \[Corroded\] status to priority targets
2. **Stack**: Build stacks up to maximum (5 per target)
3. **Spread**: Extend decay across enemy formations with AoE
4. **Shred**: Watch enemy armor crumble as Soak values plummet
5. **Collapse**: Finish with Return to Dust execution

> *"You watch gleaming war-machines rust and crumble before you. You turn the Blight's own corruption into a weapon, accelerating the world's decay to unmake your enemies. You are powerful but doomed—your soul decays alongside your foes."*

### The Trade-Off

| Gain | Cost |
|------|------|
| Devastating DoT damage | +1-6 Corruption per ability |
| Armor shredding | Extreme Trauma Economy risk |
| Anti-tech specialization | Trading your soul for power |
| Machine execution | 20-50 Corruption per extended fight |

Your power comes from **willingly channeling pure entropy**. Every curse inflicts Runic Blight Corruption on you. You will accumulate Corruption faster than almost any specialization.

This is the ultimate heretical bargain.

## Core Mechanic: \[Corroded\] Status Effect

### The Stacking System

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Maximum Stacks** | 5 |
| **Base Damage** | 1d4 per stack per turn (2d6 with Accelerated Entropy) |
| **Armor Reduction** | -2 Armor per stack |
| **Duration** | 3 turns (Permanent with Inevitable Decay) |
| **Timing** | Damage at end of target's turn |

\[Corroded\] is not a simple chemical reaction—it is an act of **injecting a sliver of the Blight's entropic code** into a target, accelerating its decay.

| Stacks | Base Damage | With Accelerated Entropy | Armor Reduction |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 1d4 (avg 2.5) | 2d6 (avg 7) | -2 |
| 2 | 2d4 (avg 5) | 4d6 (avg 14) | -4 |
| 3 | 3d4 (avg 7.5) | 6d6 (avg 21) | -6 |
| 4 | 4d4 (avg 10) | 8d6 (avg 28) | -8 |
| 5 | 5d4 (avg 12.5) | 10d6 (avg 35) | -10 |

> *"Metal instantly begins to pit and flake under the entropic assault. This is not rust—this is the universe remembering that all things must end."*

### Anti-Tech Specialization

| Target Type | Bonus |
|-------------|-------|
| **Mechanical** | 2d6 damage per stack (instead of 1d6) |
| **Undying** | 2d6 damage per stack (instead of 1d6) |
| **Organic** | Standard 1d6 damage per stack |

The Rust-Witch is the **bane of all things complex and armored**. Their curses are uniquely devastating against mechanical foes, causing systems to glitch and fail.

## Trauma Economy Interface

### Self-Corruption System

| Ability | Self-Corruption Cost |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Corrosive Curse** | +1 per cast (Rank 3: reduced) |
| **System Shock** | +2 per cast |
| **Flash Rust** | +1 per target hit |
| **Inevitable Decay** | +1 per turn in combat |
| **Blight of Iron** | +3 per cast |
| **Return to Dust** | +5 per cast |

**Typical Combat Corruption Gain:**

| Combat Length | Corruption Accumulated |
|---------------|------------------------|
| 3-turn fight | ~5-10 Corruption |
| 5-turn fight | ~10-20 Corruption |
| 10-turn boss fight (with Inevitable Decay) | ~30-50 Corruption |

> *"Every curse corrupts you AND your target. You're in a race: unmake them before you unmake yourself. Your decay is the price for their decay."*

### The Corrupting Bargain

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Source** | Channeling pure entropy through the Blight |
| **Mechanism** | Each ability directly interfaces with corruption |
| **Implication** | Extreme Trauma Economy engagement |
| **Campaign Arc** | Early: Powerful. Mid: Corrupted. Late: Doomed. |

The Rust-Witch's power is not a simple magical effect—it is a **direct tap into the Blight's decaying network**. You don't just use corruption; you become a conduit for it.

| **Blight of Iron** | Active | 65 AP (1-turn Chant) | Create large persistent vortex; moderate Arcane damage; +damage vs Mechanical/Undying |

**Inevitable Decay** represents the Rust-Witch's understanding of entropy becoming absolute. Their curses are no longer temporary afflictions but a fundamental re-writing of the target's code.

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Duration Change | \[Corroded\] no longer expires; lasts until end of combat |
| Passive Cost | +1 self-Corruption per turn while in combat |
| Implication | Cannot be toggled off once learned |

> *"Decay is not a possibility; it is an inevitability. My curses do not merely afflict—they rewrite the target's code. Their end is certain. Only the timing remains negotiable."*

**Blight of Iron** creates a large, persistent vortex of decay that actively tears machines apart.

| Property | Value |

## Systemic Integration

### The DoT Controller

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Primary Function** | Sustained damage over time; armor shredding |
| **Power Source** | Channeled entropy; Blight corruption |
| **Unique Contribution** | Only specialization with permanent \[Corroded\] stacking |

The Rust-Witch is the first true **DoT specialist**:
- Requires time: Needs 3-5 turns to ramp damage
- Rewards patience: Stacking \[Corroded\] compounds over time
- Punishes burst meta: Useless if fights end in 1-2 turns
- Enables attrition: Self-sustaining via Accelerated Entropy

### Power Budget

| Metric | Expected Value |
|--------|----------------|
| \[Corroded\] stacks per fight | 10-20 stacks |
| Total Armor reduction achieved | 10-20 points (game-leading) |
| DoT damage in extended combat | 30-50% of party's total damage |
| Anti-mechanical effectiveness | Unmatched |

| Damage Output | Condition |
|---------------|-----------|
| Extreme | Extended fights (5+ turns) with Accelerated Entropy |
| High | Standard fights with armor-shredding utility |
| Low | Short fights; burst-focused encounters |
| One-shot | Mechanical/Undying bosses below 30% HP (Return to Dust) |

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Iron-Bane** | Both anti-Undying specialists; complementary approaches |
| **Myr-Stalker** | Stack DoTs together (\[Corroded\] + \[Poisoned\]) |
| **Physical damage dealers** | Your armor shredding enables their damage |
| **Sustained damage parties** | Long fights favor your style |
| **Bleeding specialists** | \[Bleeding\] + \[Corroded\] = ×1.5 Bleeding damage |

| Anti-Synergy | Reason |
|--------------|--------|
| **Burst damage parties** | Combat ends before DoTs matter |
| **Coherent parties** | Your extreme Corruption is a healing tax |
| **Short fights** | No time to ramp |

### Situational Power Profile

| Condition | Effectiveness |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Optimal** | Extended boss fights; mechanical/Undying enemies; armored targets |
| **Standard** | Mixed compositions; medium-length fights |
| **Suboptimal** | Short fights; organic enemies; burst-focused encounters |

---

## Lore Integration

### The Science of Entropy

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **\[Corroded\]** | Blight-accelerated oxidation cascades (entropy amplification at molecular level) |
| **System Shock** | Injecting paradoxical logic into machine cores (computational contradictions) |
| **Flash Rust** | Aerosol catalysts that trigger rapid metal decay |
| **Return to Dust** | Entropy acceleration field that ages target by centuries in seconds |

The Rust-Witch's abilities are NOT fantasy necromancy. They are **physics horror**—weaponizing thermodynamics through Blight amplification.

> *"I do not cast spells. I inject entropic code. I do not curse—I accelerate the inevitable. This is not magic; it is the universe's final equation, and I am its executor."*

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Iron-Banes** | Heretics who should be purged—but useful against the Undying |
| **Jötun-Readers** | Fascinating case study; dangerous colleagues |
| **Dvergr** | Abomination; corruption of proper engineering |
| **Alchemist Guild** | Competitors; they achieve similar results through chemistry |
| **General Population** | Fear and loathing; "the ones who rot machines" |

### The Doomed Path

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Early Campaign** | Powerful; manageable Corruption |
| **Mid Campaign** | Corrupted; visible decay; social consequences |
| **Late Campaign** | Doomed; trading remaining humanity for final power |
| **End Game** | The DELETE command made flesh—but at what cost? |

The Rust-Witch's campaign arc is a **tragedy in progress**. You start as a pragmatist who channels corruption for good ends. You end as a corrupted shell who has traded everything for the power to unmake.

> *"I know what I am becoming. I know the price. But every Undying Juggernaut I reduce to scrap, every mechanical horror I return to dust—that is a price worth paying. My soul was always going to decay. At least this way, it takes them with me."*

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the old sagas, the witches cursed with words of power and the world obeyed. In the Age of Echoes, the Rust-Witch has learned a darker truth: the world is already cursed. The Blight's corruption runs through everything—steel and flesh, stone and soul. The Rust-Witch does not fight this corruption. They wield it. They whisper words of dissolution and gleaming steel flakes to rust. They point at a war-machine and speak its true name: 'Scrap.' Centuries of decay compress into seconds, and the Undying horror crumbles to dust. They are the agents of entropy, the heralds of the inevitable end. They prove that in a corrupted world, the only constant is decay. But this power has a price. Every curse that rots their enemies also rots them. Every act of unmaking unmakes a piece of their soul. They are in a race against themselves—destroying their foes before they destroy themselves. Their saga is written in rust and ruin, a chronicle of systemic collapse. They are the system's final error message. They are the DELETE command made flesh. They are the ones who prove that the only way to fix a broken program is to delete it."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Rust-Witch (Agent of Entropy) represents the extreme heretical Mystic specialization optimized for sustained DoT damage and armor destruction. Mechanical role: attrition controller who excels in extended combat through stacking \[Corroded\] effects. Core mechanic: \[Corroded\] status (1-5 stacks; deals 1d4/2d6 damage per stack per turn; reduces Armor by 2 per stack; permanent duration with Inevitable Decay). Key differentiator: only anti-tech specialist with mechanical-specific finisher; highest Corruption accumulation rate in game. Signature ability: Return to Dust (massive damage to single Mechanical/Undying; if kills, explodes and applies \[Corroded\] to all other enemies). Trauma Economy integration: Extreme risk; ALL active abilities inflict self-Corruption; +20-50 Corruption per extended fight. Social function: pragmatist who weaponizes the Blight against itself. Optimal deployment: extended boss fights; Mechanical/Undying-heavy encounters; parties that can capitalize on armor shredding."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Rust-Witch (Agent of Entropy). ARCHETYPE: Mystic. PATH TYPE: Heretical. ROLE: DoT Controller / Armor Shredder / Anti-Tech Specialist. PRIMARY STAT: WILL. SECONDARY STAT: WITS. TERTIARY STAT: FINESSE. RESOURCE: Aether Pool (AP). CORE MECHANIC: \[Corroded\] stacking (max 5; base 1d4/stack/turn, 2d6 with Accelerated Entropy; -2 Armor/stack). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Entropy): Philosopher of Dust, Corrosive Curse (25 AP, +1 Corruption), Entropic Field (40 AP). T2 (Advanced Decay): System Shock (45 AP, +2 Corruption, Stun vs Mechanical), Flash Rust (35 AP, +1 Corruption/target, AoE \[Corroded\]), Accelerated Entropy (2d6/stack, +3 AP on DoT tick). T3 (Mastery): Inevitable Decay (permanent \[Corroded\], +1 Corruption/turn), Blight of Iron (65 AP, 1-turn Chant, +3 Corruption, zone damage). CAPSTONE: Return to Dust (90 AP, once per combat, +5 Corruption, massive Arcane damage, if kills Mechanical/Undying → explodes + AoE \[Corroded\]). TRAUMA ECONOMY: Extreme risk; 20-50 Corruption per extended fight; all abilities self-corrupt."*

---

## Summary

The Rust-Witch is the **agent of systemic collapse**.

They are the DELETE command made flesh—Mystics who have learned to weaponize the Blight's entropic corruption against the world's machines. Their curses do not merely damage; they **unmake**. Steel rusts. Systems fail. Complex machines crumble to scrap. Given enough time, nothing survives their patient, methodical destruction.

Their gameplay is a tense race against decay: stack \[Corroded\] to maximum, shred enemy armor to nothing, then execute with Return to Dust. But every curse that destroys your enemies also destroys you. The Corruption accumulates with every ability, every turn, every act of unmaking.

This creates a unique niche: the **extreme heretical DoT specialist** who trades soul for power. Where the Alka-hestur proves coherent science can match corruption, the Rust-Witch proves that sometimes, the corrupted solution is the only solution. Some machines are too armored, too resilient, too protected for clean answers. Against them, you need someone willing to pay the price.

The Rust-Witch is that someone.

Your saga is a tragedy in progress—a chronicle of rust and ruin that ends with either victory or dissolution. You are powerful but doomed. Your soul decays alongside your foes.

But every Undying Juggernaut you reduce to scrap, every mechanical horror you return to dust—that is a price worth paying.

*Entropy is inevitable.
Decay is a weapon.
The only way to fix a broken program is to DELETE it.*
