## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Ability Type** | Active — Bonus Action |
| **Tier** | 3 (Mastery) |
| **PP Cost** | 5 / 5 / 5 |
| **Resource Cost** | 20 Stamina + 5 Psychic Stress |
| **Cooldown** | Once per combat |
| **Prerequisite** | 16 PP invested in Alka-hestur tree |

## Thematic Description

> *"In the press of combat, you cannot reach your bench. But you can improvise—dangerously, brilliantly, with materials at hand."*
> 

Volatile Synthesis is the Alka-hestur's **emergency payload creation**. When your rack is empty and the bench is far away, you can synthesize payloads from ambient materials—but the process is dangerous, requiring mental focus that leaves psychic scars.

## Mechanical Implementation

### Base Effect (Rank 1)

- **Cost**: 20 Stamina + **5 Psychic Stress** (volatile handling)
- **Effect**: Create **1 payload** of any type from ambient materials
- **No components required**
- **Payload is Unstable**: Must be used within **3 turns** or degrades
- **Cooldown**: Once per combat

### Rank 2

- **Output**: Create **2 payloads**
- **Stress**: Reduced to **3** (down from 5)
- **Stability**: Stable for **5 turns** (up from 3)
- **PP Cost**: 5

### Rank 3

- **Output**: Create **3 payloads**
- **Stress**: Reduced to **2**
- **Stability**: Payloads are **stable** (no degradation)
- **Cocktail Creation**: Can create Cocktails via Volatile Synthesis
- **PP Cost**: 5

---

## Unstable Payload Rules

| Rank | Stability Window | Degradation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 turns | Payload becomes inert |
| 2 | 5 turns | Payload becomes inert |
| 3 | Stable | No degradation |

---

## Trauma Economy

Volatile Synthesis is the **only Stress-costing ability** in the Alka-hestur tree.

| Rank | Stress Cost | Risk Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 5 | Medium |
| 2 | 3 | Low-Medium |
| 3 | 2 | Low |

**Justification**: Field synthesis from ambient materials requires dangerous mental focus—improvising chemistry under combat pressure strains coherence.

## Synergies

### Internal (Alka-hestur Tree)

- **Payload Strike**: Use synthesized payloads immediately
- **Rack Expansion**: Synthesized payloads fill empty rack slots
- **Cocktail Mixing**: Rank 3 enables field-synthesized cocktails
- **Area Saturation**: Emergency resupply for AoE

### External (Party Composition)

- **Extended combats**: Resupply when rack depleted
- **Stress healers**: Mitigate Synthesis cost
- **Surprise encounters**: Create payloads without preparation

---

## Tactical Applications

### Emergency Resupply

When your rack is empty mid-combat:

1. Volatile Synthesis (Bonus Action)
2. Create 1-3 payloads of needed type
3. Continue Payload Strikes

### Rank 3: Field Cocktails

- Create dual-payload cocktails without bench access
- Costs 2 of your 3 synthesized payloads
- Enables advanced combos in extended fights

### Stress Management

- Once per combat limits accumulation
- 2-5 Stress per combat is manageable
- Reserve for critical moments

## v5.0 Compliance Notes

✅ **Trauma Economy**: Psychic Stress reflects dangerous improvisation

✅ **Emergency Tool**: Fills resource gap without breaking preparation philosophy

✅ **Once Per Combat**: Appropriately gated

✅ **Scaling Risk**: Higher ranks reduce Stress cost
