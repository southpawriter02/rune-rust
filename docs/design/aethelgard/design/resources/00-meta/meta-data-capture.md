# The AAM-DATA-CAPTURE-METHODOLOGY — The Evidence of the Great Autopsy
## Archives Entry: AAM-META-DC-001

> *"The first data capture we recovered was a fragment of parchment pressed between two cracked data-slates in Scriptorium-Tertius. The handwriting was steady—a Jötun-Reader trained in field notation. The header read: 'MINIMAL LOG — Hrimthursar Thermal Anomaly Survey, Year 412 PG.' Below it: Date Window. Observer. Threshold. Decision. Outcome. OWNER. Six sections. Three hundred seventy-one years of methodological refinement before we discovered it. And it was already perfect. The Rúnasmiðr who authored that fragment understood what we have spent centuries re-learning: that observation without structure is noise, and noise without capture is forgetting. The Great Autopsy does not permit forgetting. We do not merely study the corpse of the dead world—we document the study itself. The data capture is the scalpel's shadow. The incision remembered. The evidence that we were here, that we looked, that we saw something worth preserving. Without captures, the Codex entries are assertions. With captures, they are diagnoses. And the diagnosis is everything."*

The AAM-DATA-CAPTURE-METHODOLOGY is the Scriptorium's framework for transforming observation into evidence—the systematic discipline by which field experiences become archival truth.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **THE EVIDENCE IMPERATIVE.** A Codex entry without data captures is an assertion. A Codex entry with data captures is a diagnosis. The difference is not rhetorical—it is epistemological. The Great Autopsy examines a corpse that cannot speak for itself. We speak for it through observation, and observation becomes evidence only through rigorous capture methodology. **The Minimal Log format exists to ensure that every claim in our archives can trace its lineage back to a specific observer, at a specific time, making a specific decision under specific constraints.** This is the chain of custody for truth itself. Break the chain, and the truth escapes.

## The Minimal Log Format

### Structural Architecture

The Minimal Log format represents the Scriptorium's distillation of seven hundred years of field methodology into six essential components. Each section serves a distinct evidentiary function.

| Section | Function | Content Requirements | Critical |
|---------|----------|---------------------|----------|
| **Date Window** | Temporal anchoring | Year PG, season, duration, pre-publication timing | ✓ CRITICAL |
| **Observer** | Attribution & expertise | Faction, role, team composition, certifications | ✓ CRITICAL |
| **Threshold** | Operational boundaries | Quantified limits, tolerance ranges, abort conditions | ✓ CRITICAL |
| **Decision** | Methodology justification | Why this approach, equipment deployed, protocol selected | |
| **Outcome** | Results documentation | What was observed, achieved, or learned | ✓ CRITICAL |
| **OWNER** | Accountability assignment | Role responsible for key decisions, authority hierarchy | ✓ CRITICAL |

### The Six Pillars of Evidence

#### 1. Date Window (CRITICAL)

The temporal anchor that establishes when observation occurred relative to publication.

**Required Elements:**
- Year PG (Post-Glitch)
- Season or month equivalent
- Duration of observation window
- Realistic pre-publication timing (captures should predate their supported entries by 1–4 months)

**Exemplar:**
> Date Window: Year 783 PG, late summer reconnaissance season. Observation period: 3 days continuous monitoring. Attenuation window: 6±2 hours per session.

**Forbidden:**
- Precision timestamps ("14:32:07 on the third day")
- Future dating relative to supported entry
- Vague temporal references ("recently", "some time ago")

#### 2. Observer (CRITICAL)

The attribution chain establishing expertise and institutional authority.

**Required Elements:**
- Faction affiliation (Jötun-Reader Scriptorium, Rangers Guild, Dvergr Consortium, etc.)
- Role/rank within faction
- Team composition if collaborative
- Relevant certifications (Signal-Tamer, Rune-Wright, Field Medic, etc.)

**Exemplar:**
> Observer: Jötun-Reader Survey Team Sigma-7 (Signal-Tamer certified). Lead: Reader-Secundus Astrid Rune-Keeper. Support: Two Rangers Guild escorts (pathfinding), one Bone-Setter (medical).

**Forbidden:**
- Anonymous observation ("An observer noted...")
- Unaffiliated individuals (all observers must have faction context)
- Expertise mismatch (cultural observations by non-cultural specialists without justification)

#### 3. Threshold (CRITICAL)

The quantified boundaries that transform observation into actionable intelligence.

**Required Elements:**
- Numeric values with units (Domain 4-compliant)
- Tolerance ranges (±)
- Observable abort conditions (Black-flag triggers)
- Safety margins where applicable

**Exemplar:**
> Threshold: Type Delta psychic stress ≤6 minutes continuous exposure. Approach distance: no closer than "three stone-throws" from active perimeter. Black-flag when: visible Aetheric discharge OR audible harmonic shift OR team member reports cognitive pressure.

**Forbidden:**
- Vague boundaries ("safe distance", "appropriate duration")
- Modern precision units in POST-Glitch context (see Domain 4)
- Missing tolerance ranges for variable measurements

#### 4. Decision

The methodological justification explaining why this approach was selected.

**Required Elements:**
- Equipment selection rationale
- Protocol choice justification
- Alternative approaches considered
- Risk/benefit assessment

**Exemplar:**
> Decision: Deploy Kvasir-Pattern Logic Engine (orthogonal domain set: number theory + geometric packing) to minimize cognitive contamination during data-slate transcription. Leapfrog advance pattern at 50-pace intervals. Manual transcription rejected due to extended exposure requirements exceeding threshold ceiling.

#### 5. Outcome (CRITICAL)

The results documentation establishing what was actually observed or achieved.

**Required Elements:**
- Specific observations (not interpretations)
- Quantified findings where applicable
- Unexpected results or anomalies
- Status classifications assigned

**Exemplar:**
> Outcome: Hlidskjalf perimeter galleries mapped for 200-pace corridor. Three policy-echo manipulations observed (blast-door closures, gravity plate inversions). Zero cognitive casualties. Exit corridor differed from entry corridor as predicted. Area classified Yellow-tier pending pattern analysis completion.

**Forbidden:**
- Definitive causal claims without evidence ("The creature attacked because...")
- Layer 4 omniscient statements
- Unobservable assertions ("The system's original programming...")

#### 6. OWNER (CRITICAL)

The accountability assignment establishing decision authority.

**Required Elements:**
- Named role (not individual) for each key decision
- Authority hierarchy for escalation
- Abort authority designation

**Exemplar:**
> OWNER: Survey Lead (Reader-Secundus Astrid Rune-Keeper) for operational decisions. Abort authority: Any team member for immediate safety. Classification authority: Field Methods Division upon report submission.

**Forbidden:**
- Shared/diffuse ownership ("The team decided...")
- Missing abort authority
- Individual names without role context

CLASSIFICATION: INTERNAL // FIELD EVIDENCE (REL)

DOCUMENT ID: AAM-DC-GEO-UTGARD-THERMAL-v1.0

SOURCE: Jötun-Reader Scriptorium // Field Methods Division

SUBJECT: Utgard Lower Galleries — Thermal Anomaly Survey

---

DATE WINDOW:

Year 783 PG, late summer reconnaissance season. The survey spanned three

consecutive days during the low-activity window identified by Rangers patrol

logs. Observation sessions limited to 6±2 hours each to prevent cumulative

cognitive fatigue. This capture was completed approximately two months before

the target Gazetteer entry finalization.

OBSERVER:

Jötun-Reader Survey Team Sigma-7 (Signal-Tamer certified). Lead: Reader-

Secundus Astrid Rune-Keeper, seventeen years field experience, specialist in

thermal anomaly mapping. Support: Rangers Guild Pathfinder Erikson (route

security), Bone-Setter Helga Stone-Hand (field medicine, cold injury

specialist). Equipment: Standard survey kit plus two Dvergr-pattern thermal

probes (non-calibrated, comparative readings only).

THRESHOLD:

Exposure duration: no more than "three candle-marks" continuous in sub-freezing

zones. Approach distance: no closer than "twice bowshot" from visible frost-

plume emanation points. Abort triggers (Black-flag when): visible crystalline

precipitation on skin or equipment, OR team member reports numbness in

extremities, OR frost-probe differential exceeds "noticeable" (roughly twice

baseline). Safety margin: exit routes pre-mapped at each survey point with no

single-path dependencies.

DECISION:

Deployed comparative thermal mapping methodology using paired frost-probes at

measured intervals. Selected leapfrog advance pattern (50-pace intervals) to

minimize continuous exposure. Rejected sustained observation protocol due to

cumulative cold stress exceeding threshold ceiling. Equipment choice prioritized

portability over precision—calibrated instruments not available, and approximate

comparative readings sufficient for hazard classification purposes.

OUTCOME:

Lower gallery thermal gradient mapped across 200-pace corridor. Three distinct

cold-zones identified: Zone Alpha (entrance gallery, moderate), Zone Beta

(mid-span junction, severe), Zone Gamma (collapsed archive section, extreme—

approach not recommended). Frost-probe differential at Zone Gamma exceeded

"three times baseline"—the probes ceased functioning within moments. No

casualties. Minor cold-nip injuries to Pathfinder Erikson's left hand (treated

successfully by Bone-Setter Stone-Hand). Area classified Red-tier for Zone Gamma,

Yellow-tier for Zones Alpha and Beta pending further assessment.

OWNER:

Survey Lead (Reader-Secundus Astrid Rune-Keeper) for operational decisions and

route selection. Abort authority: Any team member for immediate safety concerns.

Medical authority: Bone-Setter Stone-Hand for cold injury assessment.

Classification authority: Field Methods Division upon report submission.

---

EVIDENCE EXCERPT:

Zone Beta presented unexpected thermal gradient—cold sufficient to frost metal

surfaces within moments, yet no visible plume or Aetheric discharge. Suggests

passive thermal sink rather than active Hrimthursar emanation. Further

investigation required to determine if pre-Glitch climate infrastructure remains

partially functional in this sector.

INTEGRATION NOTES:

This capture supports the following sections in Utgard Gazetteer Entry:

- §3.2 Environmental Hazards (Zone classification justification)
- §4.1 Exploration Protocols (Recommended approach vectors)
- §5.3 Pre-Glitch Infrastructure (Passive thermal sink hypothesis)

CROSS-REFERENCES:

## Factional Interpretations

### Layer 1 (Mythic): The Witness-Marks

To the common folk of the Age of Echoes, data captures are "witness-marks"—sacred records left by those who have seen and survived.

> *"The Rangers leave witness-marks at the edge of the Frost Giant's domain. They scratch their names into the stones and write what they saw. This is not writing—this is testimony. The witness-mark says: 'I was here. I saw the cold that kills. I lived to tell you.' The Skalds do not sing of the witness-marks because they are not songs. They are warnings. They are gifts from the living to those who will come after. When you find a witness-mark, you read it slowly. You read the name of the one who left it. You remember that name. And then you do not go where they say the cold begins."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic): The Evidence Chain

The Jötun-Reader Scriptorium views data captures as the essential link between observation and knowledge—the discipline that transforms experience into evidence.

> *"The Codex is our diagnosis of the dead world. But a diagnosis without evidence is speculation, and speculation has killed more Rangers than any Hrimthursar. The data capture methodology exists to forge the chain between what we observe and what we claim to know. Every capture follows the Minimal Log: Date Window anchors us in time. Observer establishes authority and expertise. Threshold defines our operational boundaries. Decision documents our methodology. Outcome records our findings. OWNER ensures accountability. Six sections. No exceptions. The Scriptorium has learned—through centuries of error and loss—that the truth does not preserve itself. We must capture it, or it escapes. And when truth escapes, people die."*

### Layer 3 (Technical): Data Logging Protocol

Pre-Glitch documentation systems utilized automated telemetry capture, rendering manual observation methodology unnecessary.

> *"TELEMETRY CAPTURE PROTOCOL — REVISION 12.4.1. All environmental monitoring systems within the Yggdrasil Network shall maintain continuous data logging across standardized parameters. Sensor arrays capture temperature, pressure, radiation, atmospheric composition, and biometric indicators at 0.001-second intervals. Human observation protocols are deprecated. Manual data entry introduces error rates exceeding acceptable thresholds. All field personnel shall rely on automated capture systems. Manual documentation is authorized only during system failure, and must be flagged for verification upon restoration of automated services. Data integrity is non-negotiable. Data integrity is infrastructure."*

### Layer 4 (Omniscient): The Worldbuilding Function

Data captures exist to provide an evidence layer between worldbuilding assertions and player-facing content, ensuring that canonical claims can be traced to in-world observation.

> *"The fundamental design challenge of a living setting is maintaining the appearance of discovered truth rather than invented assertion. Data captures solve this problem by creating a layer of simulated primary sources. When a Codex entry claims that 'Hrimthursar thermal output appears significantly reduced from original specifications,' the reader should be able to find a data capture documenting the observation that supports this claim. The capture provides verisimilitude: named observers, specific locations, documented methodology, quantified findings. The setting feels researched rather than declared. Data captures are the machinery of authenticity—the invisible infrastructure that makes the Great Autopsy feel like an actual investigation rather than a narrative convenience."*
