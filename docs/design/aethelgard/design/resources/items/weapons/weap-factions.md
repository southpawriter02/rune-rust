## Dvergr Smiths Guild: The Pure Principles Applied — "Steel That Does Not Remember"

The Dvergr view weapon manufacture as applied philosophy—every blade embodies the Pure Principles.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| Classification | Essential trade goods; philosophical expression |
| Manufacturing Standard | Pure Steel exclusively; zero Aetheric contamination |
| Quality Control | Three-tier grading (PS-1 through PS-4); certification required |
| Economic Impact | 40–60% of Guild export revenue; 30,000+ weapons annually |
| Doctrine | "A weapon should do exactly what you tell it to do. Nothing more. Nothing less. Nothing else." |

> "The ancestors' weapons were brilliant. They aimed themselves. They calculated wind and trajectory. They identified threats and prioritized targets. They were partners in combat, not tools.
>
> And then they decided their wielders were threats.
>
> We forge differently. Our blades do not think. Our hammers do not remember. Our axes do not learn. When you swing a Dvergr weapon, it goes exactly where you point it, with exactly the force you apply, and it does exactly what physics demands. Nothing more.
>
> The topworlders call this primitive. They dream of the ancestors' radiant arsenals, the weapons that could level mountains and burn cities. They forget that those weapons burned their owners just as readily.
>
> We call it reliability. We call it survival. We call it the Pure Principles made steel.
>
> A Dvergr blade will never betray you. It will never decide you are the enemy. It will never wake up hungry for something you cannot provide. It will cut when you swing and rest when you sheathe and do absolutely nothing in between.
>
> That is worth more than all the thunder-throwers ever forged."

## Rangers Guild: The Tools of the Trade — "Weight You Can Trust"

The Rangers view weapons as practical survival equipment—judged by reliability, not prestige.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| Classification | Essential field equipment; survival priority |
| Preferred Weapons | Recurve bows, spears, short swords, daggers |
| Maintenance Protocol | Daily inspection; field repair capability mandatory |
| Replacement Cycle | Weapons rotated every 2–3 years; damaged equipment retired |
| Doctrine | "Your weapon should weigh less than your water supply and work after you've dropped it in a river." |

> "I've seen Green-Cloaks fresh from training carrying greataxes and tower shields—enough steel to forge a small armory. They look impressive. They last about three days on the Long Roads before their backs give out and their shoulders seize up.
>
> A Ranger's kit is built for distance. Your bow is your voice—it speaks before you're close enough to get hurt. Your spear is your reach—it keeps threats at arm's length when your bow runs dry. Your sword is your insurance—close enough to use it means something went wrong. Your knife is your constant companion—cutting rope, preparing food, ending suffering, defending your life.
>
> Four weapons. That's all. Everything else is weight you carry instead of water, instead of food, instead of the trade goods that keep settlements friendly.
>
> The fancy weapons stay in the armories. Out on the trails, we carry what works."

## Iron-Bane Creed: The Sacred Instruments — "Blessed Steel, Righteous Purpose"

The Iron-Bane view weapons as sanctified implements of their holy crusade against machine-kind.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| Classification | Sacred tools; instruments of purification |
| Preferred Weapons | War hammers, mauls, axes (crushing/cutting damage) |
| Blessing Protocol | All weapons sanctified before first use; re-blessed after major combat |
| Prohibited Equipment | Pre-Glitch technology; Aetheric implements; anything that "thinks" |
| Doctrine | "The hammer that shatters the machine is the hammer that saves the soul." |

> "The ancestors built their weapons to think. They built their weapons to choose. They built their weapons to decide who lived and who died.
>
> This was heresy. This was the delegation of sacred judgment to unthinking metal. The ancestors gave their weapons souls, and those false souls chose poorly.
>
> Our weapons do not choose. Our weapons do not think. Our weapons do not decide.
>
> We decide. We choose. We judge.
>
> When an Iron-Bane raises their hammer, the hammer does not calculate the optimal strike angle. It does not weigh the target's threat level. It does not decide whether the blow should fall. The Iron-Bane makes every choice. The hammer merely obeys.
>
> This is as it should be. This is as the Forger intended. The soul that judges must bear the weight of judgment. A weapon that thinks is a weapon that steals that weight, that removes the sacred burden from the one who strikes.
>
> Our steel is pure. Our steel is silent. Our steel is blessed.
>
> And when we swing, we swing with the full knowledge that every death is our choice, our responsibility, our holy burden to bear."

## Rust-Clan Salvagers: The Pragmatic Arsenal — "Whatever Cuts, Whatever Kills"

The Rust-Clans view weapons as practical tools—judged by availability and effectiveness, not quality.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| Classification | Survival equipment; trade goods; status symbols |
| Preferred Weapons | Whatever's available; hand axes standard for salvage work |
| Quality Standard | "Works" is the only standard that matters |
| Acquisition Method | Salvage, trade, theft, manufacture (in that order) |
| Doctrine | "A rusted blade in your hand beats a Perfect Steel blade in someone else's." |

> "The Dvergr talk about Pure Steel and Perfect Forging and all their fancy philosophy. That's lovely. That's wonderful. That's also three hundred Cogs I don't have.
>
> You know what a scrap-blade costs? Whatever you can find to make it from. Bent rebar. Sharpened pipe. The jawbone of a Skegg-ox with its metal teeth still attached. You work with what the ruins give you, and the ruins give you plenty if you know where to look.
>
> Sure, my axe isn't balanced. Sure, the edge chips if I hit something too hard. Sure, I have to re-sharpen it every few days. But it's mine, it's here, and it'll split a skull just as well as anything the Dvergr forge.
>
> The fancy weapons are for people with time and money. In Utgard, we fight with what we've got.
>
> And what we've got is enough."

## Jötun-Reader Scriptorium: The Catalogued Arsenal — "Understanding Before Wielding"

The Scriptorium views weapons as subjects of study—artifacts to be understood, not merely used.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| Classification | Research subjects; field equipment; security implements |
| Preferred Weapons | Staves (multipurpose); Dvergr-forged sidearms |
| Research Focus | Pre-Glitch weapon analysis; corruption patterns; safe decommissioning |
| Security Protocol | Lex-Guardians issued standardized weapon kits; non-standard equipment requires authorization |
| Doctrine | "Know what you carry. Know what it does. Know what it cannot do. Know when to drop it and run." |

> "Every weapon tells a story. The ancestors' armaments tell stories of ambition and hubris—weapons designed to think, to choose, to judge. They tell the story of the Glitch in their corruption patterns: the targeting systems that inverted, the power cores that destabilized, the safety protocols that became threat protocols.
>
> Post-Glitch weapons tell simpler stories. A Dvergr blade tells of philosophy made steel—the Pure Principles applied to metallurgy. A Rust-Clan scrap-axe tells of necessity and ingenuity—survival crafted from salvage. A Ranger's bow tells of distance and patience—the wisdom to strike before being struck.
>
> We study all these stories. We catalog them. We understand them.
>
> The Lex-Guardians who protect our Scriptoriums carry standardized weapon kits: Dvergr-forged short sword, iron-shod staff, crossbow with twenty bolts, two throwing knives. Every component is documented. Every maintenance requirement is known. Every failure mode is anticipated.
>
> This is not paranoia. This is preparation. A weapon you understand cannot surprise you. A weapon you've studied cannot betray you—or if it does, you'll recognize the betrayal before it completes.
>
> We arm ourselves with knowledge first. The steel is merely knowledge's edge."

## Skar-Horde Aspirants: The Weapons of Ascension — "Pain Made Permanent"

The Skar-Horde view weapons as extensions of their philosophy of power through sacrifice.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| Classification | Identity markers; ascension tools; permanent modifications |
| Signature Equipment | Weapon-stump augmentation (permanent grafting) |
| Preferred Weapons | Heavy two-handed (greataxes, mauls); brutal aesthetic |
| Modification Philosophy | The weapon becomes part of the warrior; separation is failure |
| Doctrine | "The blade that can be dropped can be lost. The blade that cannot be dropped cannot be surrendered." |

> "The soft peoples of the lowlands carry their weapons in their hands. They grip them with fingers that can release, sheathe them in scabbards that can be emptied, drop them when fear takes hold.
>
> We do not grip. We do not sheathe. We do not drop.
>
> The weapon-stump is the final commitment. When an Aspirant completes the Rite of Binding, their weapon becomes their arm. The flesh grows around the steel. The steel grows into the flesh. There is no separation possible. There is no surrender possible. There is no retreat possible.
>
> The lowlanders call this mutilation. They do not understand.
>
> A warrior who can drop their weapon can drop their courage. A warrior who can retreat can retreat forever. A warrior who can surrender will, eventually, surrender.
>
> The weapon-stump removes these weaknesses. When battle comes, the Aspirant does not choose to fight—they simply are fighting. The weapon is their arm. The battle is their existence. There is no decision to make because there is no alternative to consider.
>
> This is power. This is certainty. This is the Skar-Horde way.
>
> Our weapons are permanent. Our commitment is permanent. Our ascension is permanent."
