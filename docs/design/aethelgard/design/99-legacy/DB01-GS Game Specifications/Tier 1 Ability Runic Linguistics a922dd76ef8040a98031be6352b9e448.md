## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Runic Linguistics is the Jötun-Reader's **foundational lore-gathering tool**—their academic mastery of the Elder Futhark as a language. While Mystics see runes as power conduits, the Jötun-Reader sees them as a scientific language with syntax, rules, and discernible meaning.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Unlock ability to read [Runic Text] in the world
- **Secondary:** Solve runic puzzles and discover hidden lore
- **Limitation:** Can read, not cast—translator, not spellcaster
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The decryption key to the Old World's secrets

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High (gates significant content)
- **Non-Combat:** Pure exploration/puzzle utility
- **Specialization Gate:** Only Jötun-Readers can access this lore
- **Narrative Integration:** Core to deep story discovery

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Jötun-Reader has dedicated years to studying the syntax of the Elder Futhark. They understand the "cosmic grammar"—not as a mystic force, but as a **scientific language** with logical rules and precise meaning.

Where others see meaningless, archaic symbols, the Jötun-Reader sees *words*. Warnings. Instructions. History. The runes speak to them, not with magic, but with the clarity of translated text.

*They are not casters. They are translators.*

### Thematic Resonance

Runic Linguistics establishes the Jötun-Reader as the key to unlocking the world's deepest mysteries—proof that understanding is more valuable than power.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Translation Capability

**Passive Effect:**

- Can read and understand any non-magical, text-based runic inscription
- Automatically translates [Runic Text] on `investigate` command

### Readable Content

| Content Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| **Lore Tablets** | Backstory about Great Silence, Jötun-Forged history |
| **Warning Glyphs** | Alerts about traps, dangerous areas |
| **Puzzle Clues** | Passwords, sequences, logical hints |
| **Activation Runes** | Instructions for ancient machinery |

### Limitation

- **Reading ≠ Casting:** Understanding "Isa means stasis" does not grant ice magic
- Separates Jötun-Reader (Adept translator) from Rúnasmiðr (Mystic caster)

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Interaction:** Player uses `investigate` on [Runic Text]
2. **Passive Check:** Does character have Runic Linguistics?
3. **If No:** "The runes are meaningless to you."
4. **If Yes:** Full translation displayed
