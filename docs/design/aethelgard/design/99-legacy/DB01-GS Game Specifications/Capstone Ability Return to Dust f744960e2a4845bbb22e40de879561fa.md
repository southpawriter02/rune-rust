## Description

You channel all your power into a single, undeniable decree of unmaking. You point at a technological foe and speak its true, final name: **"Scrap."** The target is subjected to centuries of decay in a single horrifying moment. Metal oxidizes completely, circuits melt, structural bonds dissolve. Its source code is completely corrupted, overwritten with a single command: **DELETE**.

## Mechanics

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Action Cost** | Standard Action |
| **Resource Cost** | 90 Aether |
| **Frequency** | Once per combat |
| **Targeting** | Single Mechanical/Undying enemy |
| **Corruption Cost** | +5 Runic Blight Corruption |

### Primary Effect

- Deals **8d10 + WILL** Arcane damage

- **Cannot target organic enemies**

### On Kill: Rust Explosion

- Target explodes in shower of rust and shrapnel
- Deals **4d8 Physical damage** to ALL other enemies
- Apply **1 stack [Corroded]** for 2 rounds to ALL other enemies

## Tactical Applications

### Optimal Usage

1. Whittle mechanical boss to 30-40% HP
2. Use Return to Dust as finisher
3. Explosion spreads decay to adds, enabling cleanup

### Risk Assessment

<aside>
☠️

**Extreme Corruption:** +5 is equivalent to 5 combats' worth of accumulation. Save for when you can afford the soul cost or have Bone-Setter support afterward.

## Integration Notes

- **Execution Tool:** Best used on low-HP mechanical bosses
- **Party Enabler:** Explosion spreads [Corroded] to entire formation
- **Kill-Dependent:** Explosion only triggers on kill—ensure target is low enough
- **Mechanical-Only:** Completely useless vs organic enemies
