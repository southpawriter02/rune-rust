# Specialized Armor

## A. Servitor Shell Armor (Salvaged Automata Plating)

| Property | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Examples** | Servitor plates, automata shell fragments, Jötun-forged scrap |
| **Classification** | Medium Armor (typically) |
| **Soak** | Varies (typically 12–15 Soak full set) |
| **Penalties** | Standard Medium (-1d10 Agility; +2 Stamina) |
| **Special Properties** | **[Electrical Resistance]** — Half damage from electrical sources; **[Heavy]** — +2 Stamina cost |
| **Availability** | Salvage only; cannot be newly manufactured |
| **Common Names** | Giant-Hide, Machine-Skin, The Dead Giant's Shell, Jötun-Scrap |

> **Diagnostic Notes:** Servitor shell armor represents the most coveted salvage prize in Aethelgard—Adamant-Weave plating stripped from fallen Jötun-Series automata and refashioned for human use. The material's durability exceeds Pure Steel; a properly fitted suit of servitor shell can last generations. The catch: Adamant-Weave cannot be reforged, only cut and fitted. Each suit is unique, shaped from whatever plates the salvager recovered.

> [!WARNING]
> **BLIGHT CONTAMINATION RISK**
> All Servitor Shell Armor must be scanned for residual Aetheric contamination before use. Scriptorium certification required. Uncertified salvage may contain active Blight traces; wearing contaminated armor carries Static Sickness risk.

### Example Armor

| Tier | Name (Quality) | Soak | Value (PS) | Special |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Scrap Servitor Fragments** (Scavenged) | 13 Soak | 350 PS | [Electrical Resistance]; incomplete coverage |
| 2 | **Fitted Servitor Shell** (Clan-Forged fit) | 15 Soak | 800 PS | [Electrical Resistance]; Blight-certified |
| 4 | **Master-Fitted Automata Plate** (Optimized) | 18 Soak | 2,500 PS | [Electrical Resistance]; reduced penalties; +2 MIGHT |

## B. Symbiotic Carapace (Living Armor)

| Property | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Examples** | Myr-Shell bonded armor, living carapace, symbiotic plates |
| **Classification** | Light to Medium (varies by bond level) |
| **Soak** | 8–14 Soak (grows with wearer) |
| **Penalties** | None to -1d10 Agility (varies by bond level) |
| **Special Properties** | **[Living]** — Regenerates damage over time; **[Bonded]** — Cannot be removed without ritual; **[Adaptive]** — Soak increases with wearer level |
| **Availability** | Extremely Rare; requires symbiotic bonding ritual |
| **Common Names** | The Living Shell, Second-Self, Myr-Bond, The Skin That Grows |

> **Diagnostic Notes:** Symbiotic carapace represents the most controversial armor type in Aethelgard—living organisms (typically Myr-mutated chitin structures) that bond permanently with a host, growing and adapting to provide protection. The bond is irreversible; the carapace becomes part of the wearer's body, fed by their metabolism, responsive to their will. Scriptorium classification: Hazardous Biological Technology. Use restricted to authorized research personnel.

### Example Armor

| Tier | Name (Status) | Soak | Value (PS) | Special |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3 | **Juvenile Carapace** (Rare) | 10 Soak | 4,000 PS | [Living]; [Bonded]; grows +1 Soak per 5 Legend |
| 4 | **Mature Symbiote** (Very Rare) | 14 Soak | 12,000 PS | [Living]; [Adaptive]; regenerates 1 HP/round |
| 5 | **Ancient Myr-Bond** (Myth-Forged equivalent) | 18 Soak | 35,000 PS | [Living]; [Adaptive]; regenerates 3 HP/round; +4 STURDINESS; immune to [Bleeding] |

## C. Scrap-Plate (Rust-Clan Standard)

| Property | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Examples** | Junk-plate, salvage armor, improvised fortress wear |
| **Classification** | Light to Heavy (varies by construction) |
| **Soak** | Varies wildly (4–18 Soak) |
| **Penalties** | Varies; typically worse than equivalent quality |
| **Special Properties** | **[Improvised]** — Unreliable; **[Repairable]** — Can be field-fixed with any metal; **[Ugly]** — -2 to social checks |
| **Availability** | Common in Jötunheim; easily manufactured |
| **Common Names** | Junk-Shell, Rust-Plate, Whatever-Works, Utgard Fashion |

> **Diagnostic Notes:** Scrap-plate represents the Rust-Clan philosophy of protection—armor assembled from whatever materials the ruins provide, held together by determination and salvage wire. No two suits look alike; each is a unique collage of automotive panels, pipe sections, structural supports, and actual armor fragments. The construction quality varies enormously, but the principle remains constant: some protection beats no protection.

### Example Armor

| Name | Construction | Soak | Value (PS) | Special |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Desperate Junk-Wrap** | Scraps | 3 Soak | 5 PS | Falls apart after 3 combats |
| **Functional Scrap-Plate** | Salvaged metal | 8 Soak | 40 PS | [Improvised]; -1 Defense |
| **Quality Rust-Plate** | Sorted salvage | 12 Soak | 120 PS | [Repairable]; standard penalties |
| **Master Scrap-Suit** | Best salvage | 16 Soak | 300 PS | [Repairable]; reduced penalties; intimidating |
