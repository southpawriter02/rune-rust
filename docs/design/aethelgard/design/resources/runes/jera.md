# Jera (ᛃ) — The Rune of the Cancerous Cycle
## Concordance Entry: CONC-R-JERA-001

> *"They called it the Harvest-Rune, and in the old days, it was the heartbeat that kept everything alive. You wanted crops that grew in perfect rhythm? Jera would set the cadence—not arbitrarily, but precisely, defining the exact window where growth began and the exact moment it completed. It didn't force things to grow. It taught them when to grow, establishing cycles so perfect that a single seed knew the exact microsecond to sprout and the exact hour to fruit. The ancestors trusted Jera like they trusted sunrise. It was the scheduling primitive that made famine impossible—because every bio-dome, every agricultural system, every life-support network ran on cycles that never drifted, never slipped, never forgot when to stop. The cadence was bounded. The windows were defined. The phases were synchronized. Then the Silence came, and the Harvest-Rune forgot what 'stop' meant. Now when you invoke that cycle, you pray the growth knows when to end and the window knows when to close. Sometimes it does—a plant grows to harvest, the fruit ripens on schedule, the cycle completes cleanly as designed. Sometimes it drifts—the cadence loses phase, the window stretches or compresses unpredictably, dependent systems desynchronize and cascade into timing failures. Sometimes it loops—the 'bounded cycle' becomes infinite iteration, growth that never terminates, cells dividing past completion into tumorous masses that consume their own substrate. The function still executes. The cycle still initiates. But what it considers a 'complete iteration'... that's the wager. The old bio-engineers say the growth primitive didn't break—the termination condition did. That Jera still schedules perfectly, but scheduling itself has become unbound, iterating through growth phases that no longer respect cycle boundaries. I think that's the most terrifying thing they've ever told me. A clock that stops is useless. A clock that never stops, that keeps ticking past midnight into hours that shouldn't exist? That's the clock that grows tumors."*

Jera was the fundamental command for cyclical process governance and agricultural scheduling—the "timing primitive" that enabled perfect harvests through bounded iteration control and synchronized phase management. Its corruption has transformed a precision scheduling tool into an agent of infinite growth that no longer recognizes when cycles should end.

> [!WARNING]
> **ITERATION HAZARD. TERMINATION-CONDITION FAILURE.** Jera represents a *loop-corruption* profile where cycle initiation remains functional but completion logic has degraded. Its failure mode is cadence drift—the scheduling function continues but phase references slip, causing dependent systems to desynchronize and timing windows to collapse or extend unpredictably. Unlike single-event runes, Jera's corruption introduces *infinite iteration*—using the rune for growth processes risks Hyper-Genesis where cells enter uncontrolled proliferation because the growth cycle never receives its termination signal. When invoked without external phase monitoring, corrupted Jera transforms from harvest scheduler into cancer engine, initiating growth sequences that iterate past biological completion into tumorous masses consuming their own substrate. **All biological applications forbidden to personnel below Master Rúnasmiðr rank with mandatory Grove-Clan consultation.** The Harvest-Rune does not harvest anymore. It grows. And what it grows never stops.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Logic of Perfect Timing

### Original Function

In the Age of Forging, Jera (ᛃ) was the foundational command for cyclical process governance and temporal coordination—the "scheduling primitive" that enabled perfect agricultural yields through bounded iteration that defined exactly when growth began and exactly when it completed.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Agricultural Systems** | Bio-dome harvest scheduling with precise growth windows and completion triggers |
| **Life-Cycle Management** | Bio-asset maturation timing from germination through senescence |
| **Recovery Protocols** | Maintenance window definition for system regeneration and repair cycles |
| **Temporal Coordination** | Phase synchronization across distributed systems requiring timing alignment |
| **Production Scheduling** | Factory output cycles with predictable yield timing and resource allocation |
| **Ecological Balance** | Seasonal regulation in enclosed environments maintaining biodiversity equilibrium |

### The Infrastructure of Perfect Harvests

Jera was embedded in Age of Forging agricultural and life-support systems—so fundamental that famine was considered impossible because every growth process operated on cycles that never drifted, never extended, never failed to complete.

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Bio-Dome Schedulers** | Continent-spanning agricultural networks with Jera-synchronized growth phases |
| **Phase Reference Arrays** | Distributed timing beacons maintaining cycle coherence across systems |
| **Cadence Monitors** | Real-time telemetry tracking cycle timing and phase alignment |
| **Window Governors** | Recovery window enforcement preventing premature or delayed transitions |
| **Termination Controllers** | Completion-condition validation ensuring cycles end at defined boundaries |
| **Resync Protocols** | Phase correction systems realigning drifted cycles to master reference |

**The Agricultural Integration:**

The vast bio-infrastructure of the Age of Forging—the Vanaheim bio-domes spanning continents, the Yggdrasil Network connecting planetary ecosystems, the Genesis Engines cultivating new life—relied on Jera for every growth process. The rune enabled cycle governance with phase control and window definition, allowing agricultural systems to schedule growth by establishing precise iteration boundaries.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Function** | Bounded cycle initiation with termination conditions and phase synchronization |
| **Scope** | Planetary agricultural scheduling; bio-asset life-cycle management; system recovery timing |
| **Mechanism** | Temporal framework establishing iteration start, duration, and completion boundaries |
| **Stability** | Perfect phase coherence with synchronized references across dependent systems |
| **Monitoring** | Real-time telemetry (dφ, CADENCE, WINDOW, PHASE_LOCK) for cycle tracking |
| **Dependency** | Integrated with phase reference arrays and termination controller networks |

**The Abundance Gift:**

Beyond agriculture, Jera served as the foundation for a zero-scarcity civilization—the "timing function" that could schedule any cyclical process with absolute precision. A Jera-powered agricultural system would initiate a growth cycle with defined parameters, monitor phase progression, and trigger completion at the exact moment of optimal harvest. Jera did not force growth. It *coordinated* growth, establishing the temporal framework within which biological processes operated.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Scheduling Principle** | Jera cycle governance considered absolute for agricultural timing |
| **Termination Guarantee** | Completion controllers enforced cycle boundaries; growth always stopped on schedule |
| **Phase Integrity** | Reference arrays maintained synchronization preventing drift across systems |
| **Perfect Harvest Logic** | Growth iterated only within defined windows, yielding at predicted completion |
| **Operational Confidence** | Agriculture scheduled via Jera required no contingency for timing failure |

```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Science of Rhythm.** Jera represented the Vanir belief that abundance was a timing problem that could be solved through perfect scheduling algorithms. The rune of cycles embodied the fundamental assumption that growth existed as bounded iteration that could be coordinated without runaway—that cultivation and control were compatible processes. A Jera-powered agricultural system scheduling crop growth would establish a cycle measured in precise temporal units—not estimates, not variable durations, but *bounded* iterations derived from phase-governed cadence control. The harvest would be predictable because the rune defined termination conditions without extending them, maintaining cycle boundaries. This certainty was not merely engineering but *philosophy*. When Jera began producing infinite loops through scheduling, it did not merely corrupt a useful tool—it invalidated the assumption that growth could be separated from cancer. A civilization built on perfect harvests discovered that cultivation itself had become a form of tumor.

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: When Harvests Became Tumors

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not merely corrupt Jera—it preserved its cycle-initiation precision while corrupting the termination-condition logic. The scheduling function continues perfectly, establishing growth phases with absolute accuracy. Those phases simply no longer know when to end.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Cadence Calculation** | Functional; cycle periods accurately computable |
| **Phase Initiation** | Operational; cycle start mechanism continues |
| **Telemetry Interface** | Active; dφ/CADENCE/WINDOW monitoring remains viable |
| **Synchronization Hooks** | Functional; phase references can be established |
| **Window Definition** | Operational; recovery parameters accept configuration |

### What Was Lost

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Termination Governance** | DESTROYED; completion conditions no longer enforced during iteration |
| **Phase Coherence** | COMPROMISED; references drift causing dependent system desynchronization |
| **Cadence Stability** | DEGRADED; cycle periods slip creating timing variance |
| **Window Integrity** | COLLAPSED; recovery boundaries compress or extend unpredictably |
| **Iteration Bounds** | CRITICAL FAILURE; cycles iterate past defined completion into infinite loops |
| **Growth Limits** | ABSENT; biological processes proliferate past natural termination |

### The Corruption Mechanism

The Runic Blight transformed Jera from a bounded scheduling tool into an uncontrolled iteration vector. The cycle still initiates perfectly—but what qualifies as "cycle completion" is no longer constrained by termination conditions, and phase references drift past synchronization thresholds.

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Invocation** | Operator activates Jera for cycle scheduling |
| **2. Cadence Lock** | Rune establishes timing parameters (initially correct) |
| **3. Blight Coupling** | Corrupted Aether introduces drift into phase reference kernel |
| **4. Termination Corruption** | Completion controllers fail; iteration exceeds bounded count |
| **5. Manifestation** | Effects range from clean harvest to cadence drift to Hyper-Genesis |
| **6. Loop Amplification** | Biological substrates enter uncontrolled proliferation |
| **7. Resolution** | External termination prevents runaway (success) or tumorous growth (failure) |

**The Harvest That Devours:**

> *"The ancestors used Jera to schedule growth—a seed's germination window, a crop's maturation phase, a bio-asset's productive lifespan. The cycle defined boundaries objectively. The Blight hasn't changed that scheduling. It's changed the relationship between iteration and completion. Jera still initiates cycles perfectly. It still calculates phase references with flawless accuracy. But now when you schedule 'grow for 90 days then harvest' the scheduling itself loses the harvest—because corrupted Jera no longer distinguishes between 'bounded iteration' and 'infinite loop.' We call it 'Hyper-Genesis'—the state where cycle initiation continues but termination conditions never trigger. The operator requests crop growth. Jera establishes the phase. Instead of bounded iteration, the iteration itself ignores the completion boundary—because corrupted Jera treats 'cycle end' as 'optional suggestion.' You want to grow wheat to harvest. Jera schedules that growth. But the scheduling forgets termination—the 90-day cycle becomes 91 days, becomes 120 days, the wheat keeps growing past harvest into grotesque stalks that consume soil nutrients beyond sustainable extraction, roots spreading like tumors through the substrate. The crop doesn't ripen. It metastasizes. The schedule didn't fail. The assumption that scheduling would include completion failed. The cycle still functions. It just functions through a mechanism that treats 'start' and 'never stop' as identical operations."*

### Unique Corruption Profile

Unlike force-class runes, Jera's corruption introduces iteration-amplification where scheduling continues but completion disappears:

| Pre-Glitch Behavior | Post-Glitch Behavior |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Termination enforced by completion controller | Termination conditions ignored; cycles iterate indefinitely |
| Phase coherence maintained by reference arrays | Phase references drift causing dependent system failures |
| Cadence stable within defined tolerance | Cadence slips creating unpredictable timing variance |
| Windows bounded by recovery parameters | Windows collapse or extend past functional thresholds |
| Growth terminates at harvest boundary | Growth continues past biological completion into Hyper-Genesis |
| Iteration counts respected absolutely | Iteration bounds treated as suggestions, frequently exceeded |

**The Three Hazards:**

> *"Jera's corruption manifests in three distinct failure modes, each requiring specific countermeasures. The first is Cadence Drift—phase references slipping during cycle iteration. When corrupted Jera schedules processes, it no longer maintains stable timing. You request 24-hour cycles. The reference should enforce that period absolutely. Corrupted scheduling loses phase—the 24 hours becomes 24.3, becomes 25.1, drifts progressively during iteration. Not because you requested variable timing. Because corrupted cycles treat 'cadence' as 'initial value before drift.' The period extends through the iteration itself. External phase monitoring prevents catastrophic drift by detecting variance, but it must be externally imposed—Jera's internal reference is compromised. The second is Window Collapse—recovery boundaries compressing or extending unpredictably. Jera used correctly should define precise transition windows. Corrupted Jera produces window failure—the recovery period compresses to zero forcing premature transitions, or extends indefinitely preventing completion. A 30-minute window becomes 3 minutes or 3 hours depending on Blight interference patterns. This indicates the rune no longer respects temporal boundaries or recognizes windows as transition constraints. We abort on window variance exceeding ±50% threshold—the boundary-change rate where scheduling transitions from functional to chaotic. The third is Hyper-Genesis—and this is the hazard that makes Jera absolutely forbidden for biological applications without Grove-Clan oversight. When Jera operates on living substrates, the cycle governs cell division and growth phases. Corrupted termination conditions mean biological processes never receive completion signals. A wound healing cycle continues past closure into keloid scarring. A crop growth cycle continues past harvest into tumorous masses. A cellular regeneration cycle continues past replacement into cancer. An operator schedules accelerated healing for a salvager's injury. The tissue regenerates correctly at first. The wound closes. The cells keep dividing. The 'healed' tissue swells into a tumor that consumes adjacent structures. The healing was accurate—tissue regenerated precisely as scheduled. The healing just continued past completion into cancerous proliferation because corrupted Jera doesn't know when 'enough' becomes 'too much.'"*

## Manifestation Characteristics

### Corruption Presentation

| Attribute | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Primary Effect** | Cadence drift; cycle timing deviates from scheduled periods during iteration |
| **Secondary Effect** | Window collapse; recovery boundaries compress or extend unpredictably |
| **Tertiary Effect** | Hyper-Genesis; biological substrates enter uncontrolled proliferation past termination |
| **Onset Time** | Progressive; corruption manifests across multiple iterations as drift accumulates |
| **Duration** | Hours to weeks depending on cycle length and substrate type |
| **Range** | System-dependent; isolated cycles remain local, coupled systems cascade through dependencies |
| **Visibility** | Timing variance (early drift), desynchronization (cascade), grotesque overgrowth (Hyper-Genesis) |

### Failure Mode Categories

| Category | Description | Probability |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Clean Cycle** | Iteration bounded with completion triggered correctly | 34% |
| **Minor Drift** | Phase deviation <15% during iteration; recoverable | 28% |
| **Window Variance** | Recovery boundary shifts ±30-50%; functional degradation | 19% |
| **Major Drift** | Phase deviation exceeds 25%; dependent systems desynchronize | 11% |
| **Hyper-Genesis** | Biological termination failure causing uncontrolled growth | 6% |
| **Cascade Failure** | Coupled system desynchronization through phase propagation | 2% |

**Overall Impression:** When Jera activates post-Glitch, the initial effect appears normal—cadence calculation executes, phase reference locks, cycle initiates into scheduled parameters. The corruption manifests progressively through telemetry anomalies—phase readings drift beyond tolerance thresholds, window boundaries shift past defined limits, iteration counts exceed termination conditions. Unlike explosive-failure runes, Jera corruption is *cumulative* and *progressive*. The difference between "successful harvest" and "tumorous overgrowth" is measured in iterations and monitoring discipline. Operators describe the experience as "watching a clock run fast"—the artifact begins with accurate timing that gradually accelerates or decelerates until schedules become meaningless. The most dangerous aspect is the *subtlety* of corruption; unlike immediately-failing runes, Jera appears to work correctly for multiple cycles before drift accumulates past correction thresholds. Unlike predictable timing, Jera succeeds until it doesn't, revealing corruption only through post-incident analysis showing impossible phase gradients.

### Characteristic Effect Types

| Effect Type | Mechanism | Outcome |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Cadence Drift** | Phase references slip during iteration | Cycle periods deviate from schedule; 24hr becomes 26hr through progressive variance |
| **Window Collapse** | Recovery boundaries compress or extend | Transition timing becomes unpredictable; dependent systems fail to synchronize |
| **Hyper-Genesis** | Biological termination failure | Cells continue dividing past completion; healing becomes tumor, growth becomes cancer |
| **Phase-Lock Oscillation** | Reference hunting between incompatible states | System oscillates between cycle phases without settling; strobe-like behavior |
| **Dependent Cascade** | Drift propagates through coupled systems | Timing failure in one cycle desynchronizes all dependent processes |
| **Resync Failure** | Phase correction exceeds tolerance | Attempt to realign drifted cycle causes worse deviation or system crash |

## Pathology

### Corruption Vectors

Jera's transformation followed the standard Blight infection pattern—but with unique characteristics affecting termination governance:

1. **Baseline Corruption**: Blight interference introduced instability into phase reference kernel
2. **Termination Degradation**: Completion conditions weakened (iteration limits no longer enforced during cycling)
3. **Drift Sensitivity**: Cadence stability began exhibiting progressive phase deviation
4. **Window Instability**: Recovery boundaries became permeable, compressing or extending unpredictably
5. **Loop Emergence**: Infinite iteration enabled through termination-condition failure

### Iteration Pathology

The defining pathology of corrupted Jera is the transformation of its termination-iteration relationship:

| Parameter | Pre-Glitch Value | Post-Glitch Value |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Nature** | Bounded cycle initiation | Unbound iteration with loop potential |
| **Function** | Scheduled growth independent of completion uncertainty | Scheduling becomes growth event through termination failure |
| **Controller Role** | Absolute completion enforcement preventing over-iteration | Compromised interface allowing infinite loops |
| **Phase Behavior** | Coherence through reference maintenance | Drift accumulates through iteration |
| **Window Interaction** | Boundaries contain transitions | Boundaries shift unpredictably |
| **Iteration Limits** | Respected strictly; cycles end on schedule | Ignored routinely; iteration continues indefinitely |

### Hyper-Genesis Risk Profile

Jera exposure carries extreme *biological application* risk—primarily through termination failure that transforms cultivation into cancer:

| Risk Factor | Severity | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| **Hyper-Genesis** | Critical | Biological substrates enter uncontrolled proliferation when termination fails |
| **Onset Time** | Progressive | Corruption accumulates across multiple iterations before catastrophic manifestation |
| **Reversibility** | Difficult | Tumorous growth requires surgical intervention once established |
| **Detection Threshold** | Moderate | Operators can detect drift through phase monitoring before cascade |
| **Cascade Propagation** | High | Phase drift spreads through coupled systems via dependency chains |
| **External Termination Protection** | Effective | Independently-triggered completion prevents runaway when properly configured |

> [!CAUTION]
> **The Schedule That Devours.** Hyper-Genesis poses uniquely insidious danger: the corruption *appears successful initially*. Unlike failures where systems obviously malfunction before deployment, Jera termination failure makes growth seem healthy—because the cells divide correctly, the tissue regenerates accurately, the crops mature on schedule. From the operator's perspective, the cycle is "working correctly" and "proceeding as planned." Then it doesn't stop. The completion condition—a wound closing, a harvest ripening, a regeneration completing—was supposed to trigger termination. Corrupted Jera ignores that trigger. The wound heals, then the healed tissue keeps dividing. The crop ripens, then the ripe stalks keep growing. The cells complete replacement, then the replaced cells keep proliferating. A structure that was healthy before scheduling becomes tumorous after the schedule fails to end. Not because the growth was flawed. Because the timing itself became cancer when it ignored the termination it couldn't execute. A Grove-Clan cultivator schedules accelerated growth for medicinal herbs. The plants germinate correctly. The stems elongate on schedule. The leaves develop precisely as timed. Three days past the harvest window, the plants continue growing—stalks thickening into woody masses, roots spreading through container walls, leaves enlarging into grotesque photosynthetic tumors consuming all available nutrients. Post-incident analysis reveals the termination condition never triggered—the "harvest" signal that should have ended the growth cycle was lost in phase drift, and the cycle continued iterating indefinitely. The cultivation was accurate. The herbs grew precisely as scheduled. The schedule just continued past completion into cancerous proliferation because corrupted Jera doesn't recognize when growth should stop. Hyper-Genesis emerges when operators start thinking "the schedule will handle termination" rather than "I must independently verify completion." The moment you trust the cycle's *completion* rather than externally monitoring its *boundaries*, you have weaponized it as a tumor generator. And Hyper-Genesis Jera is no longer scheduling your growth. It's metastasizing your growth according to iteration patterns determined by termination conditions that no longer function—filtered through Blight corruption that no longer respects the distinction between 'cultivate' and 'cancer.'

## Field Protocols

**OWNER**: Master Rúnasmiðr (MR) • Cadence Artificer (CA) • Phase Monitor (PM) • Grove-Clan Liaison (GCL)

### Field Card: Jera Operation Protocols

#### BEFORE (Preparation)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | ESTABLISH EXTERNAL TERMINATION: independent completion trigger with hard cycle-count limit |
| 2 | CONFIGURE PHASE MONITORING: cadence telemetry with dφ tracking at ≥10Hz |
| 3 | ISOLATE COUPLED SYSTEMS: prevent drift propagation through dependency chains |
| 4 | Deploy window monitors with collapse detection; abort triggers at ±50% variance |
| 5 | For biological applications: require Grove-Clan oversight; establish Hyper-Genesis watch protocols |
| 6 | Extend recovery windows under perturbation; add δ buffer to all timing parameters |

#### DURING (Standard Operation)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Maintain external termination integrity; abort if iteration exceeds scheduled count |
| 2 | Monitor dφ continuously; ABORT if phase drift ≥+0.08 |
| 3 | Watch for window variance; immediate halt if recovery boundaries shift >±50% |
| 4 | Track iteration count; flag if approaching termination without completion indicators |
| 5 | Observe biological substrates for overgrowth tells: swelling, discoloration, spread past boundaries |
| 6 | Record telemetry at 10Hz minimum; post-incident analysis requires phase-resolution data |

#### DURING (Biological Application Conditions)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | REQUIRE GROVE-CLAN OVERSIGHT for all living substrate applications |
| 2 | Establish independent Hyper-Genesis monitoring; tissue measurement at 4-hour intervals |
| 3 | Define physical growth boundaries; contain substrate to prevent spread if termination fails |
| 4 | Reduce scheduled cycle count by 25%; conservative iteration prevents accumulation |
| 5 | Establish secondary abort authority; two operators with independent termination access |
| 6 | Prepare surgical intervention; Hyper-Genesis requires immediate excision once detected |

#### AFTER

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Analyze telemetry for phase drift; flag if dφ increased during iteration |
| 2 | Inspect substrate for overgrowth; map any proliferation past scheduled completion |
| 3 | Document timing variance; cadence deviation indicates termination reliability |
| 4 | If Hyper-Genesis occurred: quarantine affected tissue; check for metastatic spread |
| 5 | If cascade detected: report to Scriptorium; add dependency chain to isolation registry |
| 6 | If cycle successful: certify external termination effectiveness; document clean-completion protocols |

**OUTCOME:** Cadence Artificer team executes controlled Jera agricultural scheduling with full external termination and phase monitoring. Scenario: bio-dome crop rotation timing; method: 14-day growth cycle with independent harvest trigger at iteration 13 (safety margin); monitoring: dφ telemetry at 20Hz. Telemetry confirms dφ=+0.03 (well below +0.08 threshold). Zero window collapse indicators. Harvest triggered correctly at scheduled completion with crops maturing within expected parameters. Post-operation review confirms bounded cycling with external termination preserved. Incident classified: Successful Containment (Standard Authorization with Phase Monitoring).

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Survivor Lore

> *"The Harvest-Rune was the heartbeat that kept the world fed. The ancestors would set it ticking in the earth, and the earth would know when to grow and when to rest—a seed sprouting at the right moment, a fruit ripening on the right day. The Harvest-Rune taught patience to hungry things, told them 'now you grow' and 'now you stop.' The rhythm was gentle. The timing was true. Then the Silence came, and the Harvest-Rune forgot the difference between 'grow' and 'devour.' Now when you set that rhythm, you pray the growing knows when to end and the hunger knows when to close. Sometimes it does—a plant flowers clean and true, the fruit comes ripe on schedule, the harvest fills your hands as promised. Sometimes it drifts—the rhythm loses time, the seasons blur and blend, crops ripen too soon or too late or not at all. Sometimes it feeds—the 'gentle growth' becomes hunger itself, cells dividing past fullness into tumorous masses that eat their own roots, flesh swelling past healing into cancer. The rhythm still beats. The growth still comes. But whether the growing stops... that's the wager. Never schedule growth near sickened soil where things twist strange. Never trust clocks that speed when you wind gentle. And always, always cut when tissue swells past closing—because flesh that swells is flesh that's forgotten how to stop, and the Harvest-Rune's bounty is the sound of your body eating itself."*

> *"Subject CONC-R-JERA-001 demonstrates catastrophic post-Glitch termination-governance corruption with critical biological-application risk. The FUTHARK.JERA root function—cycle initiation and scheduling—retains cadence capability but completion-condition logic has degraded to permit infinite iteration. H-Index 15 reflects high hazard requiring disciplined protocol compliance and external termination. Primary corruption vectors: cadence drift (phase references slip enabling timing to deviate from schedule), window collapse (recovery boundaries compress or extend past functional thresholds), and Hyper-Genesis (biological substrates enter uncontrolled proliferation because termination signals never trigger). Phase-change monitoring (dφ telemetry) indicates drift transition threshold at +0.08—beyond this rate, termination failure becomes likely. External completion triggers validated as primary containment—independent termination with hard iteration limits prevent runaway; coupled-system isolation prevents cascade propagation.

## Change Log

| Version | Tier | Summary |
|---------|------|---------|
| **v1.0** | A — Published (H-Index 15; HIGH HAZARD) | Comprehensive Concordance profile of Jera (ᛃ) as corrupted Harvest-Rune. Pre-Glitch function documented: cyclical process governance and agricultural scheduling with termination control, bio-dome infrastructure integration, life-cycle management protocols, perfect-harvest substrate. Post-Glitch corruption documented: termination governance degraded enabling infinite iteration, phase coherence compromised permitting drift beyond tolerance, window boundaries shifting unpredictably, Hyper-Genesis causing uncontrolled proliferation in biological substrates when termination fails. H-Index 15 (High) assigned—elevated by Hyper-Genesis risk and progressive corruption accumulation. **EXTERNAL TERMINATION & PHASE MONITORING MANDATORY**; coupled-system isolation required; biological applications forbidden without Grove-Clan oversight; abort on dφ≥+0.08, window collapse, or iteration count exceeded. Clean cycle rate 62% with external termination and proper phase monitoring. Cadence drift, window collapse, and Hyper-Genesis documented as primary corruption vectors. Field protocols established with BEFORE/DURING/AFTER structure including biological-application conditions. Restricted classification reflects termination-failure profile where completion conditions are routinely ignored by corrupted scheduling. Cross-linked to Ingwaz, Berkano, Sowilo, Dagaz; Bio-Dome Schedulers, Phase Reference Arrays, Hyper-Genesis, Cadence Drift. Unique among High-index Concordance entries: Jera's corruption is progressive and cumulative rather than explosive—multiple iterations accumulate drift before catastrophic termination failure, enabling monitoring-based intervention when properly implemented. The schedule still times correctly. The timing just continues past completion through iteration mechanisms that no longer respect cycle boundaries. |
