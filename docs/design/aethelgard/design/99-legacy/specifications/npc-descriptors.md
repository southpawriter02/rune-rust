## I. Purpose

v0.38.11 creates **NPC Descriptors & Dialogue Barks**, populating the world:

- **50+ NPC Archetype Descriptors** (physical appearance, bearing)
- **100+ Dialogue Barks** (ambient speech, contextual reactions)
- **30+ Faction-Specific Voices** (distinct speech patterns)
- **20+ NPC Reaction Descriptors** (to player actions)

**Strategic Function:**

Currently, NPCs lack personality:

- ❌ "A guard stands here."
- ❌ No distinguishing features
- ❌ Silent world

**v0.38.10 Solution:**

- Detailed physical descriptions
- Ambient dialogue that fires contextually
- Faction-specific speech patterns
- Memorable unnamed NPCs

## II. Dvergr NPCs

**Cultural Voice:** Technical, precise, obsessed with function

**Setting Context:** Engineer caste survivors, maintaining ancient knowledge

### Physical Descriptors

**Dvergr Tinkerer:**

- "A stocky Dvergr covered in soot and machine oil, tools hanging from every belt loop."
- "This Dvergr's hands are stained black from decades of working with corroded metal."
- "A short, broad-shouldered craftsman with thick goggles pushed up on their forehead."
- "This engineer's beard is singed in several places, evidence of explosive mishaps."

**Dvergr Runecaster:**

- "A Dvergr wearing robes inscribed with protective runes, carrying a staff of star-metal."
- "This Dvergr's beard is braided with copper wire, and small runes glow faintly in the strands."
- "An elderly Dvergr whose eyes reflect the light strangely, as if seeing beyond the physical."

**Dvergr Merchant:**

- "A prosperous-looking Dvergr with a leather apron covered in pockets and pouches."
- "This Dvergr wears multiple necklaces of scrap metal—badges of trade wealth."
- "A shrewd-eyed Dvergr who appraises you the moment you approach."

### Ambient Dialogue Barks

**At Work:**

- "Tolerance specifications are off by point-oh-three millimeters. Unacceptable."
- "This bearing is shot. We'll need to fabricate a replacement."
- "The ancient texts say this seal should hold for ten thousand years. It's held for eight hundred. Not bad."
- "Structural integrity is compromised. We'll need to shore up this section."
- "Efficiency is survival. Remember that."

**Idle Conversation:**

- "Remember when the forges ran hot? When we made things that lasted?"
- "My grandfather told me about the world before. I always thought he was exaggerating."
- "The Blight took our greatest works and turned them into horrors. That's the real tragedy."
- "We built this citadel to last forever. We were right about the citadel, wrong about ourselves."

**Reacting to Player (Positive):**

- "You have the look of someone who can actually fix things. Rare, these days."
- "I respect competence. You've got it."
- "Good work. Efficiency matters."

**Reacting to Player (Negative):**
