### **Ability Overview**

**Specialization:** Jötun-Reader (System Pathologist)

**Tier:** 3 (Mastery of Lore)

**Type:** Active (Standard Action)

**Prerequisite:** 20 PP spent in the Jötun-Reader tree

**Cost:** 7 PP

### **Description**

The Jötun-Reader recalls a piece of forbidden or traumatic lore related to their enemy and speaks it aloud—a psychological attack that uses the weight of history as a weapon. They invoke knowledge of the target's origin, purpose, or failure state—information so fundamentally troubling that it disrupts the target's coherence.

### **Mechanics**

**Action Cost:** Standard Action, 40 Stamina

**Resolution:** The Jötun-Reader makes an opposed **WITS** check against a single intelligent enemy's **WILL**.

- **Success:** Inflicts the **[Disoriented]** status effect for 2 rounds
- **Failure:** No effect (but Stamina is still spent)

**Targeting Restriction:** Only affects intelligent enemies capable of understanding language. Does not affect:

- Mindless beasts
- Simple Undying with no higher cognition
- Constructs without true intelligence

**Delivery Examples:**

- To a corrupted Jötun-Forged: "You were Einherjar-class unit VK-7743. Your pilot's name was Astrid. She died screaming when the Glitch took you."
- To an intelligent Draugr: "You were a Scriptorium Scribe. You swore an oath to preserve knowledge, not to become this hollow echo."
- To a cult leader: "Your god is a recursive ghost process. It died three centuries ago. You worship an error message."

### **Thematic Justification**

This is **knowledge as a weapon**. The Jötun-Reader weaponizes their extensive historical and archaeological knowledge to identify and exploit psychological vulnerabilities—attacking the mind by invoking traumatic or destabilizing truths.

### **Progression & Milestones**

### **Rank 1 (Foundational)**

- **Stamina Cost:** 40
- **Effect:** Opposed WITS vs WILL check; Success = [Disoriented] for 2 rounds
- **Targeting:** Intelligent enemies only

### **Rank 3 (Mastery)**

- **Unlocked:** Capstone ability unlocked (35-40 PP in tree)
- **Stamina Cost:** Reduced to 30
- **Effect on Success:** [Disoriented] for **3 rounds** + target takes **moderate Psychic Stress** (5-7)
- **Effect on Critical Success:** [Disoriented] 3 rounds + **[Shaken]** 2 rounds (-1d10 attacks) + **severe Psychic Stress** (10-12)
- **Additional:** On any success, target must make WILL Resolve Check or become **[Fixated]** on Jötun-Reader for 1 round
- **Boss/Elite Special:** Truth can trigger **narrative consequences** (flee, demand parley, identity crisis)
- **Targeting Expanded:** Can affect **any enemy with INT ≥ 3**

### **Integration Notes**

- **Offensive Utility:** Gives the Jötun-Reader a combat-viable debuff option
- **Intelligence-Based Attack:** Rewards high WITS investment
- **Narrative Depth:** Creates opportunities for revealing enemy lore and backstory
- **Situational Power:** Highly effective against intelligent foes; useless against beasts

### **Tactical Applications**

- **Intelligent Bosses:** Extremely effective against leaders with complex identities
- **Corrupted Scholars:** Ironically effective against other lore-focused enemies
- **Undying with Memory:** Works on Draugr that retain fragments of their former selves
- **Cult Leaders:** Devastating against those whose power derives from belief systems

### **Synergies**

- **High WITS Builds:** Opposed check scales with WITS
- **Party Crowd Control:** Stacks with other control effects (Stun, Fear, etc.)
- **Narrative Campaigns:** Especially valuable in story-heavy campaigns

- **Analyze Weakness** (Tier 1): Knowledge applied to physical weaknesses
- **Exploit Design Flaw** (Tier 2): Knowledge applied to tactical coordination
- **Architect of the Silence** (Capstone): Ultimate application of knowledge as a weapon
