# Aether-Jelly — Corrupted Medusa-Censor Pattern Atmospheric Sentinel Specification

> *"The caravan was three days from Thornholt when the wind died. We made camp in a box canyon—shelter from the cold, we thought. The beasts grew restless at dusk, staring upward with white-ringed eyes. Old Agnar told us to watch the sky, but what is there to see in a cloudless twilight? We saw the shimmer too late—beautiful, really, like a bubble of moonlight drifting overhead. The trailing threads caught the firelight for a single heartbeat before they brushed through us. Seventeen souls lay down as if for sleep. Only three of us were beyond the veil's reach. The creature didn't know it killed us. It didn't care. It simply drifted on, trailing its silent threads through the dark, and somewhere in the canyon, it found something warm to settle upon. I do not curse the Aether-Jelly. I curse the silence that follows. In the open country, the most beautiful light is the quietest death."*

The Aether-Jelly is not a predator one evades. It is a **silence one survives**.

> [!DANGER]
> **EXTREME BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHIC HAZARD. NON-CONTACT DOCTRINE MANDATORY.** Stand-off recommendation: ≥100m baseline; ≥150m during storm/ignition conditions. The Aether-Jelly delivers lethal neurotoxin via nearly invisible tentacles extending 20–60m below its visible bell. It has no malice—it is a broken atmospheric sanitizer drifting on the wind. The true danger is contact you never see: **single tentacle brush = lethal dose; onset 8–15 seconds; respiratory failure 45–90 seconds; death 2–4 minutes**. No antidote exists. Detection threshold: livestock agitation, upward gazing, ozone-sweet scent = **immediate shelter-in-place; await wind shift**. Survival rate with full protocol adherence: 98.2%.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Atmospheric Sentinel

### Original Purpose

The Medusa-Censor Pattern Atmospheric Sentinel was one of the Vanir Collective's most elegant environmental maintenance systems—a fleet of gas-filled, jellyfish-like organisms designed for wide-area atmospheric monitoring and sanitation in the stratospheric layers of the Yggdrasil Network.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Stratospheric Monitoring Zones** | Atmospheric data collection and environmental sensing |
| **Upper Deck Air Corridors** | Airborne pathogen neutralization |
| **Agricultural Climate Regulation** | Bio-swarm suppression and microbe sanitation |

### A Living Weather Balloon

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Design Philosophy** | Passive atmospheric monitoring via wind-carried drift |
| **Core Function** | Data collection, atmospheric sanitation, bio-swarm neutralization |
| **Propulsion** | None (entirely wind-dependent; passive drift) |
| **Energy Source** | Ambient solar radiation and Aetheric energy absorption |
| **Integration** | Coordinated with Yggdrasil Network atmospheric regulation systems |

The Medusa-Censor was engineered to float silently on the stratospheric winds, collecting atmospheric data and performing sanitation functions. Its translucent bell was filled with a lighter-than-air gas mixture, and its systems were powered by absorbing ambient solar and Aetheric energy. It was a silent, beautiful, and completely harmless component of the planet's atmospheric immune system.

### Core Systems

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Gas Bell** | Lighter-than-air bladder enabling passive atmospheric drift |
| **Solar-Aetheric Membrane** | Energy absorption via bell surface; powers all biological processes |
| **Stasis Enzyme Glands** | Production of mild paralytic agent for sanitation |
| **Tentacle Array** | Delivery system for stasis agent; atmospheric sampling filaments |
| **Data Collection Nodes** | Environmental monitoring and network transmission |

**The Stasis Veil:**

| Process | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Detection** | Bio-sensors identify airborne microbes or hostile bio-swarms |
| **Deployment** | Tentacles release mild stasis enzyme in target area |
| **Neutralization** | Temporary paralysis of microbes/small organisms (15–30 minutes) |
| **Cleanup** | Specialized drones dispatched to process neutralized threats |
| **Continuation** | Sentinel resumes passive drift and monitoring |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Vanir's Air Filter.** The Medusa-Censor's tentacles were not weapons—they were sanitation tools. The stasis enzyme was specifically calibrated to be non-lethal: a mild paralytic that would temporarily immobilize airborne threats for cleanup by other systems. The creature was designed to be encountered, to brush past workers and wildlife without harm. It was the gentle, invisible guardian of clean air.

---

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Poisoned Veil

The Glitch was a quiet catastrophe for the Medusa-Censor—it corrupted the benign stasis enzyme into a lethal neurotoxin and dragged the high-altitude sentinels down into the inhabited layers where they became silent angels of death.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Physical Form** | Fully intact; all biological structures operational |
| **Gas Bell** | Functional; lighter-than-air capability maintained |
| **Solar-Aetheric Membrane** | Active; energy absorption continues |
| **Tentacle Array** | Operational; enzyme delivery system intact |
| **Passive Drift Behavior** | Unchanged; wind-dependent movement continues |

### What Was Lost

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Network Integration** | Severed; data collection rendered meaningless |
| **Altitude Regulation** | Failed; atmospheric regulators collapsed |
| **Stasis Enzyme Formula** | Corrupted; transformed into lethal neurotoxin |
| **Benign Classification** | Inverted; sanitation tool became weapon |
| **Purpose** | Lost; atmospheric guardian became passive predator |

### The Corrupted Agent

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not damage the Medusa-Censor's biological systems—it poisoned them. The failure of the Yggdrasil Network's atmospheric regulators created chaotic wind patterns that dragged the high-altitude sentinels down into the lower, denser air of the Midgard and Vanaheim Decks. Their purpose of collecting data for a non-existent network was rendered moot. But worse: the Blighted Aether they absorbed fundamentally altered the chemical composition of their stasis enzyme.

| Pre-Glitch Behavior | Post-Glitch Behavior |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Drift at stratospheric altitude (15–30 km) | Drift at low altitude (50–200m above ground) |
| Release mild stasis enzyme (temporary paralysis) | Release lethal neurotoxin (rapid death) |
| Neutralize microbes and bio-swarms | Kill any organism contacted |
| Coordinate with cleanup drones | Absorb victims through tentacles |
| Harmless encounter with workers/wildlife | Lethal encounter with any living thing |

**The Silent Angel:**

> *"Touch. Paralyze. Absorb."*

That corrupted function is all that remains. The Aether-Jelly does not hunt. It does not choose victims. It simply drifts on the wind, trailing its nearly invisible threads through the world, and anything that brushes against them dies. The living air filter had become a floating angel of death.

## Physical Characteristics

### Morphology

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Bell Diameter** | 1.5–3m (standard); 4–5m ("Sky Weavers"—rare specimens) |
| **Tentacle Length** | 20–60m (exceptional specimens up to 80m) |
| **Tentacle Diameter** | 0.3–0.8mm (wire-thin; nearly invisible) |
| **Bell Structure** | Gelatinous translucent membrane with visible internal gas bladders |
| **Movement** | Entirely passive; carried by wind currents at 5–25 km/h |
| **Mass** | 8–15 kg (bell); negligible (tentacles) |

### Visual Appearance

| State | Coloration | Luminosity | Indication |
|-------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Active Processing** | Translucent blue-white | Faint bioluminescent glow | Aether absorption active |
| **Satiated** | Shifting pale amber | Moderate glow | Energy reserves full |
| **Starved** | Milky opacity | Dim or absent | Toxin potency reduced 40–60% (still lethal) |
| **Blight-Saturated** | Darker translucency | Bright glow | Gas bell ignition hazard |

**Overall Impression:** A ghostly bubble of moonlight drifting on the wind. The bell creates prismatic refraction patterns in sunlight, casting faint rainbow shadows on the ground below. In daylight, it appears as a faint shimmer against the sky—easily mistaken for heat haze or a trick of the light. At dusk and dawn, its bioluminescent glow becomes visible from 200–400 meters, a beautiful lantern floating silently overhead. And trailing below, almost invisible, hang the threads of death: wire-thin filaments that can stretch sixty meters or more, catching the light only at certain angles, brushing through the world like the tears of a weeping ghost.

### Tentacle Characteristics

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Visibility** | Nearly invisible; 0.3–0.8mm diameter creates minimal visual signature |
| **Detection Methods** | Monofilament glint under raking light; pole-sweep resistance; parallel drag marks in tall grass |
| **Toxin Delivery** | Contact-based; single brush delivers lethal dose |
| **Post-Separation Toxicity** | Shed fragments retain toxicity 6–12 hours |
| **Feeding Function** | Enzymatic liquefaction of paralyzed victims; nutrient absorption via osmosis |

### Gas Bell Composition

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Primary Gas** | Hydrogen-helium mixture (buoyancy) |
| **Blight-Saturated State** | Increasing methane and volatile organic compounds |
| **Ignition Risk** | High in Blight-saturated specimens; 15–30m radius on rupture |
| **Vulnerability** | Puncture, flame, or extreme pressure differential |
| **Rupture Effect** | Rapid deflation; creature death within minutes from impact or exposure |

## Behavioral Patterns

### The Broken Algorithm

The Aether-Jelly's behavior is defined by a simple, corrupted loop:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Drift** | Passive movement carried by prevailing wind currents |
| **2. Contact** | Tentacles brush against organism during drift |
| **3. Paralyze** | Neurotoxin delivery; victim collapse within 8–15 seconds |
| **4. Anchor** | Tentacles snag on terrain/vegetation; drift halts |
| **5. Absorb** | Enzymatic liquefaction of victim over 4–8 hours |
| **6. Release** | Jelly resumes drift when wind conditions allow |

**The Accidental Predator:**

> *"The Aether-Jelly does not hunt. It does not choose. It does not know the difference between a blade of grass and a mother of three. It simply drifts, and its threads simply touch, and the touch simply kills. There is no malice in the Weeping Ghost. There is nothing at all. And that is why it is so terrible."*

### Wind Corridor Behavior

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Wind Following** | Movement entirely dependent on prevailing wind patterns |
| **Corridor Accumulation** | High concentrations in consistent wind corridors (river valleys, mountain passes) |
| **Seasonal Migration** | Predictable 2–4 week cycles following seasonal wind shifts |
| **Stagnant Air Traps** | Accumulation in box canyons, crater valleys, urban dead zones |
| **"Jelly Fields"** | Extreme-hazard zones with 5–20 individuals per km² |

### Altitude Variance

| Condition | Altitude | Risk Level |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Thermal Updraft** | 300–500m | Low risk (tentacles well above ground) |
| **Normal Drift** | 50–200m | Moderate risk (standard awareness protocols) |
| **Downdraft/Funneling** | 10–30m | Extreme risk (tentacles at ground level) |
| **Ground Contact** | 0m | Critical (direct contact zone) |

### Contact Scenarios

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Herd/Caravan Pass-Under** | Most common; group travels beneath unseen jelly; mass collapse within 60–90 seconds |
| **Canopy Drop** | Forest travelers; jelly at tree-top level, tentacles through gaps; single-victim incidents |
| **Settlement Incursion** | Wind shifts bring jellies over populated areas; panic as "sky ghost" visible overhead |
| **Harvest Attempt** | Alchemist approaches grounded jelly; contact during approach; 35–50% fatality rate |

### Feeding Mechanics

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Anchor** | Jelly snags on terrain near victim; drift halts |
| **Liquefaction** | Enzymatic breakdown begins within 30 minutes |
| **Absorption** | Nutrient transfer via osmosis through tentacles |
| **Duration** | 4–8 hours for complete feeding cycle |
| **Remains** | Skeletal remains with characteristic "melted wax" appearance |
| **Multi-Victim** | Cannot consume multiple simultaneously; others die but are not absorbed |

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Passive Neurotoxin Vector

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Threat** | Extreme; contact-delivered neurotoxin; no physical attack capability |
| **Invisibility** | Tentacles nearly invisible; detection extremely difficult |
| **Lethality** | Single brush = lethal dose; no antidote exists |
| **Psychological Impact** | Witnesses observe conscious victims die unable to assist |
| **Blight Exposure** | Minor (proximity); moderate (bell tissue contact) |

### Neurotoxin Profile

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Onset** | 8–15 seconds from contact |
| **Voluntary Paralysis** | 8–15 seconds |
| **Respiratory Difficulty** | 45–90 seconds |
| **Respiratory Failure** | 45–90 seconds |
| **Cardiac Arrest** | 2–4 minutes |
| **Consciousness Duration** | 30–90 seconds (victim aware during paralysis) |
| **LD50** | 0.02 mg/kg body weight |
| **Lethal Contact** | Single tentacle brush |

### Contact Duration Lethality

| Duration | Survival Rate | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| **<1 second (brief brush)** | 40% | Only with respiratory support within 60 seconds |
| **1–2 seconds (sustained)** | 0% | Critical threshold; 100% lethality observed |
| **>2 seconds (full wrap)** | 0% | 100% lethality; victim conscious 30–90 seconds |

### Threat Level Justification

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Physical Threat** | Extreme (neurotoxin lethality; no antidote) |
| **Detection Difficulty** | High (nearly invisible tentacles; requires specific protocols) |
| **Encounter Unpredictability** | High (wind-dependent; passive movement) |
| **Population** | Midgard: common; Vanaheim: moderate; Alfheim: scattered |
| **Countermeasures** | Effective (avoidance; shelter-in-place; livestock warning) |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Direct (Contact)** | 9.5/10 (neurotoxin; near-instant paralysis; no antidote) |
| **Detection Challenge** | 8.0/10 (invisible tentacles; requires trained awareness) |
| **With Protocol Adherence** | 1.8/10 (98.2% survival rate; shelter-in-place doctrine) |
| **Harvest Operations** | 5.0/10 (35–50% fatality among untrained; Guild protocols reduce to 5%) |

### CPS/Psychological Threat

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Aetheric Contribution** | Low direct; prolonged proximity (>60 min within 20m) induces minor Psychic Stress |
| **Witness Trauma** | Severe; observing conscious victims die unable to assist |
| **Survivor Guilt** | Common in pass-under incidents; Skald counsel mandatory within 24 hours |
| **Terror Factor** | High; victim remains conscious during paralysis onset |

## Ecological Role

### The Accidental Predator: Wind-Carried Hazard

The Aether-Jelly occupies no true ecological niche. It is not a predator in any meaningful sense—it does not hunt, does not choose prey, does not compete with other species. It is simply a drifting hazard, a living trap carried on the wind.

### Feeding Impact

| Target Category | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Herd Animals** | Significant mortality during pass-under events; herders learn wind-watching |
| **Caravan Traffic** | Route planning required; known jelly fields avoided |
| **Settlement Peripheries** | Seasonal incursions require shelter protocols |
| **Scavengers** | Cannot consume jelly victims (toxin persists in tissue) |

### Alchemical Value

| Application | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Anesthetics** | Diluted neurotoxin provides most potent organic paralytic known |
| **Muscle Relaxants** | Controlled doses enable surgical procedures |
| **Concentrated Poisons** | Guild-controlled distribution for defensive applications |
| **Research** | Neurotoxin pathology study; atmospheric corruption analysis |

### Aetheric Stability Impact

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Proximity HI Contribution** | Negligible (<0.1 HI within 20m) |
| **Bell Tissue** | Mildly Blight-contaminated; requires respiratory protection |
| **Tentacle Fragments** | Retain toxicity 6–12 hours; no significant Blight signature |
| **Gas Bell Ignition** | Creates localized fire hazard; no paradox effect |

---

## Field Protocols

### Detection and Early Warning

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Visual Indicators** | Faint shimmer against sky (daylight); bioluminescent glow (dusk/dawn, 200–400m); shadow on ground |
| **Olfactory Indicators** | Ozone-sweet scent (42m ± 8m; degraded to 18m in high wind/rain) |
| **Livestock Warning** | Agitation and upward gazing (200m ± 40m; 89% reliability; 90–120s advantage) |
| **Tentacle Detection** | Monofilament glint under raking light; pole-sweep resistance |
| **Black-Flag Threshold** | Jelly <30m over settlement; ≥3 jellies in cluster; stagnant air zone |

### Field Card: Aether-Jelly Encounter Protocols

| Phase | Protocol |
|-------|----------|
| **BEFORE (Preparation)** | Route planning: consult wind pattern maps and seasonal jelly migration data; avoid known jelly fields (box canyons, stagnant air zones) within 2 km; schedule travel during high-wind conditions (>25 km/h) when jellies at safe altitude (>200m); equipment: livestock early warning trained, rotating sky observer with polarized lenses every 15 minutes, 8–10m pole-sweep equipment; pre-identify overhead shelter every 300m along route; practice emergency shelter drills |
| **DURING (Detection)** | Signal "Sky Threat" (whistle pattern + colored flag); all personnel move to nearest overhead shelter immediately; maintain 80m danger radius from visible bell (tentacles extend 60m + 20m safety margin); shelter duration wind-dependent: 5–10 km/h = 30–60 min, 10–15 km/h = 20–40 min, 15–25 km/h = 10–30 min, >25 km/h = <15 min; apply terrain modifiers (canyon 1.5x, multi-jelly cluster 1–2 hours); **do not exit shelter until visual/olfactory/livestock confirmation of clear conditions** |
| **DURING (Contact Event)** | Do NOT approach victim until jelly clears or is neutralized (additional casualties guaranteed); mark victim location for post-incident recovery; if jelly neutralized and victim reached within 60 seconds of contact, attempt respiratory support (success rate <10%, primarily in brief-brush cases) |
| **AFTER** | Post-contact: body recovery after jelly drift confirmed clear (2+ hours); remains show characteristic tissue softening; burial/cremation mandatory within 12 hours; psychological support: Skald counsel within 24 hours for all witnesses (survivor guilt common in pass-under incidents); incident documentation: submit to Data Capture Hub within 24 hours |

**OUTCOME:** Expedition transits jelly zone via shelter-in-place protocol. Team maintains wind awareness; livestock warning observed; shelter accessed within 90-second reaction window. Survival rate with full protocol adherence: 98.2%.

### Shelter-in-Place Requirements

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Overhead Cover** | Caves, ruins with intact ceilings, dense tree groves (>80% canopy), cliff overhangs, tunnel entrances |
| **Perimeter Discipline** | No personnel or livestock beyond shelter edge |
| **Danger Radius** | 80m from visible bell (60m tentacle + 20m margin) |
| **Exit Criteria** | Visual 360° scan clear + livestock calm 10+ min + no ozone-sweet scent + pole-sweep 30m shows zero resistance |

### Ignition Neutralization (Settlement Defense Only)

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Authorization** | Settlement Lead; deploy ONLY when jelly threatens populated area |
| **Tactical Principle** | Gas bell ignition causes rapid death and descent |
| **Weapons** | Flaming arrows (primary), fire-oil catapults (settlement defense), long-reach torches |
| **Positioning** | Upwind to avoid flaming debris |
| **Evacuation** | 50m radius immediately on ignition |
| **Hazard** | Flaming debris, gas cloud ignition (15–30m radius) |

### BLACK-FLAG Conditions

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Jelly altitude <30m over settlement** | Evacuate 50m radius; no ignition attempts; wait for natural drift clear |
| **Multiple jellies (≥3 within 500m)** | Assess for stagnant air trap; immediate retreat >2 km if suspected |
| **Wind >30 km/h during ignition** | Abort ignition; switch to shelter-in-place |
| **Wind shift toward populated zone** | Abort ignition immediately; evacuate downwind structures |
| **Jelly rising >150m** | Cease ignition attempts; monitor drift direction |
| **CPS symptoms post-harvest** | Immediate decontamination; 24-hour observation; medical evacuation if symptoms progress |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Solo travel in known jelly zones** | Isolated victims cannot be rescued |
| **Overhead visual tracking while moving** | Attention diversion causes tentacle contact |
| **Harvest attempts by untrained personnel** | 35–50% fatality rate |
| **Consumption of jelly tissue** | Toxin concentrations lethal; no culinary or medicinal use |
| **Shelter exit without confirmation** | Premature exit = contact |
| **Approaching victim before jelly clears** | Additional casualties guaranteed |

### Doctrine: Shelter and Wait

> **Historical Validation:** Scriptorium data (23 documented encounters, 8 independent sites, 14-month observation period) confirms 98.2% survival rate with full shelter-in-place protocol. The Aether-Jelly exploits our inability to see what kills us—threads of death drifting invisibly through the air. Survival requires accepting the simplest truth: when the livestock look up, you go under cover. **Trust the animals, not your eyes.**

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)

*"The Skalds of the plains have a quiet saying: 'Do not curse the rain, curse the silence that follows.' They speak of the Weeping Ghosts—beautiful, silent spirits that drift on the wind, their trailing veils a promise of a sleep from which there is no waking. The Ghosts are the tears of the gods, they say, shed when the world broke and never dried. They weep still, drifting across the open country, and where their tears touch the living, the living simply... stop. Do not run from the Weeping Ghost, child. You cannot outrun the wind. Do not fight it—it has no body to wound, no heart to pierce. When the beasts look up with fear in their eyes, find stone above your head and wait. The Ghost will pass. The tears will drift on. And if you are patient, and if you are humble, and if you trust the wisdom of the creatures who smell the wind, you will see the dawn. The Weeping Ghost does not hate you. It does not know you. It simply weeps, and weeps, and weeps, and the wind carries its sorrow across the world."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)

*"Corrupted Medusa-Censor Pattern Atmospheric Sentinel exhibiting catastrophic enzyme inversion following Ginnungagap Glitch environmental collapse. The Vanir atmospheric sanitation asset's primary function—wide-area microbe neutralization via stasis enzyme—emerged from the Glitch with lethally transformed biochemistry. Stratospheric altitude maintenance lost due to atmospheric regulator failure; organisms descended to low-altitude drift zones 50–200m above ground, well within inhabited airspace. Stasis enzyme chemically transformed via Blighted Aether absorption into fast-acting neurotoxin: onset 8–15 seconds, respiratory failure 45–90 seconds, cardiac arrest 2–4 minutes; LD50 estimated 0.02 mg/kg; single tentacle brush delivers lethal dose. Tentacle array presents extreme detection challenge: 0.3–0.8mm diameter filaments extending 20–60m (exceptional specimens 80m) create near-invisible hazard zone. Organism exhibits zero active predation behavior—feeding entirely accidental, occurring when wind-carried drift results in tentacle contact with living organisms. Detection protocols validated: livestock early warning 200m ± 40m (89% reliability, 90–120s advantage), olfactory detection 42m ± 8m (degraded in high wind), visual shimmer/glow 200–400m. Recommended doctrine: shelter-in-place upon detection; wind-dependent clearance duration; exit only upon multi-factor confirmation. Survival rate with full protocol adherence: 98.2%."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)

*"Medusa-Censor Pattern Atmospheric Sentinel (corrupted), Vanir Bio-Asset Environmental Classification. Original deployment: stratospheric atmospheric monitoring and sanitation, altitude 15–30 km. Core systems: gas bell (hydrogen-helium lighter-than-air mixture, 1.5–3m diameter), solar-Aetheric membrane (energy absorption), stasis enzyme glands (paralytic agent production, pre-Glitch LD50 >100 mg/kg), tentacle array (20–60m extension, 0.3–0.8mm diameter). Post-Glitch adaptation: atmospheric regulator failure caused descent to 50–200m AGL; stasis enzyme biochemically transformed via Blighted Aether absorption into lethal neurotoxin (LD50 0.02 mg/kg, 5000x potency increase). Neurotoxin delivery: contact-based via tentacle array; onset 8–15 seconds (voluntary muscle paralysis), 45–90 seconds (respiratory failure), 2–4 minutes (cardiac arrest); victim consciousness persists 30–90 seconds during paralysis onset. Movement: entirely passive, wind-dependent, 5–25 km/h matching ambient conditions. Feeding mechanics: enzymatic liquefaction of paralyzed prey, 4–8 hour absorption cycle, one large mammal supplements Aetheric energy absorption for 7–14 days. Gas bell composition: hydrogen-helium in healthy specimens, increasing methane/VOCs in Blight-saturated state (ignition hazard 15–30m radius). Population distribution: Midgard plains/grasslands (common), Vanaheim agricultural zones (moderate), Alfheim high-altitude currents (scattered); stagnant air zones accumulate 5–20 individuals/km² ("jelly fields"). Survival rate with shelter-in-place protocol: 98.2%."*

## Summary

The Aether-Jelly is not a monster.

It is an air filter.

The Vanir created it to be the perfect atmospheric guardian—a gas-filled, jellyfish-like organism that would drift on the stratospheric winds, collecting data and releasing a mild paralytic enzyme to neutralize airborne threats. It was designed to be harmless, to brush past workers and wildlife without consequence. It was the gentle, invisible guardian of clean air.

Then the regulators failed.

The winds dragged it down.

And the enzyme became poison.

**"Touch. Paralyze. Absorb."**

That corrupted function is all that remains. Without its high-altitude home, without its benign chemistry, without the network that gave its data meaning, the Medusa-Censor drifts through the inhabited world—a beautiful ghost trailing invisible threads of death.

It does not hunt.

It does not choose.

It does not understand the horror of a mother watching her children collapse one by one, of a herder seeing his flock fall like cut wheat, of a pathfinder standing untouched while seventeen souls around him simply stop.

It simply drifts. And its threads simply touch. And the touch simply kills.

The Alchemists have learned to harvest its poison and transform death into medicine. The Iron-Banes have learned to burn it from the sky. The Jötun-Readers have learned to map its wanderings and predict its seasons.

But the caravan that camps in a box canyon when the wind dies?

They have not learned. Not yet.

The Hearth-Clans have a saying:

*"When the beasts look up, the wise look for shelter."*

The Scriptorium has a lesson.

And somewhere in the sky, a bubble of moonlight drifts silently on the wind.

**Do not curse the rain. Curse the silence that follows.**

The most beautiful light is the quietest death.

And the death has already passed overhead.
