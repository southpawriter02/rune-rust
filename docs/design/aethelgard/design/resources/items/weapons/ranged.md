# Ranged Weapons

## A. Bows

| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Examples | Longbow, shortbow, recurve bow, composite bow, hunting bow |
| Base Damage | 3d10 + FINESSE |
| Range | Long (Back Row → any enemy position) |
| Hands Required | Two |
| Special Properties | [Ammunition] — Requires arrows (consumable); [Quick Draw] — Can fire twice per turn at -2 to second shot |
| Proficiency Required | Bows Proficiency |
| Governing Attribute | FINESSE |

**Common Names (Layer 1):** String-Singer, Death-from-Afar, The Silent Argument, Mercy's Distance

**Diagnostic Notes:** The bow represents the primary ranged weapon of post-Glitch Aethelgard—reliable, maintainable, and completely Blight-inert. Rangers Guild personnel universally carry bows as their signature weapon; the combination of stealth capability and engagement range allows patrol units to thin threats before melee engagement. The composite bow (incorporating multiple materials for enhanced draw strength) represents Dvergr engineering principles applied to traditional archery.

| Example Weapon | Tier | Damage | Value (PS) | Special |
|----------------|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Bent-Wood Bow (Jury-Rigged) | 0 | 1d10 + FINESSE | 15 PS | Short range only; unreliable |
| Salvaged Hunting Bow (Scavenged) | 1 | 3d10 + FINESSE | 55 PS | [Quick Draw]; standard ammunition |
| Ranger's Recurve (Clan-Forged) | 2 | 3d10 + FINESSE | 200 PS | [Quick Draw]; +1 to hit; silent |
| Dvergr Composite Bow (Dvergr-Forged) | 3 | 3d10+2 + FINESSE | 450 PS | [Quick Draw: no penalty]; +2 FINESSE; enhanced range |
| Ullr's Judgment (Myth-Forged) | 5 | 4d10+3 + FINESSE | 7,500 PS | [Quick Draw]; ignores cover; arrows seek targets (cannot miss at Long range) |

**Ammunition Table:**

| Arrow Type | Cost (per 20) | Special Effect |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Standard Arrows | 5 PS | None |
| Broadhead Arrows | 12 PS | +1d10 damage; causes [Bleeding] |
| Armor-Piercing Arrows | 18 PS | Ignores 2 Soak |
| Fire Arrows | 25 PS | +1d10 fire damage; ignites flammables |
| Blight-Warded Arrows | 40 PS | +2d10 vs. Blight-touched enemies |

## B. Crossbows

| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Examples | Light crossbow, heavy crossbow, hand crossbow, repeating crossbow |
| Base Damage | 4d10 + FINESSE |
| Range | Long |
| Hands Required | Two (One for hand crossbow) |
| Special Properties | [Ammunition] — Requires bolts (consumable); [Reload] — Requires action to reload after each shot (except repeating pattern) |
| Proficiency Required | Crossbows Proficiency |
| Governing Attribute | FINESSE |

**Common Names (Layer 1):** Click-Death, The Equalizer, Fool's Bow (derogatory—from traditional archers), Steel-Messenger

**Diagnostic Notes:** Crossbows trade rate of fire for raw power and ease of use—the mechanical draw mechanism removes the strength requirement for full-power shots. The [Reload] property represents the time-intensive spanning process; the Dvergr repeating crossbow pattern incorporates a magazine system that eliminates this limitation at increased complexity and cost. Scavenger Baron bodyguards favor crossbows for their stopping power in close-protection scenarios.

| Example Weapon | Tier | Damage | Value (PS) | Special |
|----------------|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Improvised Crossbow (Jury-Rigged) | 0 | 2d10 + FINESSE | 20 PS | [Reload]; prone to misfires |
| Salvaged Light Crossbow (Scavenged) | 1 | 4d10 + FINESSE | 80 PS | [Reload] |
| Clan Heavy Crossbow (Clan-Forged) | 2 | 4d10+2 + FINESSE | 280 PS | [Reload]; ignores 2 Soak |
| Dvergr Repeating Crossbow (Dvergr-Forged) | 3 | 3d10+2 + FINESSE | 620 PS | No [Reload]; 6-bolt magazine; +2 FINESSE |
| Gungnir's Whisper (Myth-Forged) | 5 | 5d10+4 + FINESSE | 9,800 PS | No [Reload]; ignores 4 Soak; bolts penetrate multiple targets |

## C. Throwing Weapons

| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Examples | Throwing axe, throwing knife, javelin, bola, chakram |
| Base Damage | 1d10 + FINESSE (thrown) |
| Range | Short to Medium (weapon-dependent) |
| Hands Required | One |
| Special Properties | [Recoverable] — Can be retrieved after combat; [Quick Throw] — Can throw as bonus action |
| Proficiency Required | Varies by base weapon type |
| Governing Attribute | FINESSE |

**Diagnostic Notes:** Dedicated throwing weapons provide ranged options for primarily melee-focused combatants. The [Recoverable] property reflects the practical reality of ammunition economy—unlike arrows and bolts, thrown weapons can typically be retrieved intact from fallen enemies or the surrounding environment.

| Example Weapon | Tier | Damage | Range | Value (PS) |
|----------------|------|--------|-------|------------|
| Scrap Throwing Knife | 0 | 1d6 + FINESSE | Short | 2 PS |
| Balanced Throwing Axe | 2 | 1d10+2 + FINESSE | Short | 35 PS |
| Dvergr Chakram | 3 | 1d10+3 + FINESSE | Medium | 85 PS |
| Ranger's Javelin | 2 | 2d10 + MIGHT | Medium | 45 PS |

## D. Firearms (Pre-Glitch Technology — RESTRICTED)

| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Examples | Pistol, rifle, hand cannon, scatter-gun |
| Base Damage | 5d10 + FINESSE |
| Range | Long |
| Hands Required | One (pistol) or Two (rifle) |
| Special Properties | [Ammunition] — Requires cartridges (rare, expensive); [Loud] — Alerts enemies within 3 zones; [Malfunction Risk] — 5% jam chance per shot |
| Proficiency Required | Firearms Proficiency (rare; requires special training) |
| Governing Attribute | FINESSE |

**Common Names (Layer 1):** Thunder-Stick, Ancestor's Wrath, The Screaming Metal, Fool's Fortune

> [!WARNING]
> RESTRICTED TECHNOLOGY. Firearms represent non-Aetheric pre-Glitch technology that remains functional but carries significant operational risks. Ammunition is scarce (cartridge manufacture requires industrial capability); the [Loud] property eliminates stealth options and attracts attention (including hostile automata); the [Malfunction Risk] reflects degraded mechanisms and improvised maintenance. Scriptorium policy discourages firearm use except in desperate circumstances.

| Example Weapon | Tier | Damage | Value (PS) | Special |
|----------------|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Salvaged Pistol (Scavenged) | 1 | 5d10 + FINESSE | 350 PS | [Loud]; [Malfunction: 10%]; 6-shot capacity |
| Maintained Rifle (Optimized) | 4 | 6d10 + FINESSE | 1,200 PS | [Loud]; [Malfunction: 5%]; ignores 3 Soak |
| Dvergr Hand-Cannon (Dvergr-Forged) | 3 | 5d10+3 + FINESSE | 800 PS | [Loud]; [Malfunction: 3%]; reduced noise |
| Ullr-Pattern Rifle (Myth-Forged) | 5 | 7d10+5 + FINESSE | 15,000 PS | No [Malfunction]; ignores 5 Soak; scope grants +3 to hit |

**Ammunition Costs:**

| Cartridge Type | Cost (per 10) | Availability |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| Standard Rounds | 50 PS | Rare |
| Armor-Piercing | 120 PS | Very Rare |
| Explosive | 200 PS | Extremely Rare |
