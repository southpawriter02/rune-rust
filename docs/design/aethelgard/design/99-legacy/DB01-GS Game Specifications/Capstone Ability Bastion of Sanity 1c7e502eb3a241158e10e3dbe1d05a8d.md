## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Bastion of Sanity is the Skjaldmær's **ultimate expression**—a capstone that combines a permanent defensive aura with a once-per-combat Reaction that can **absorb an ally's Trauma**. This is the pinnacle of the "sanity anchor" identity.

### Mechanical Role

- **Passive Aura:** +1 WILL and -10% environmental Psychic Stress for Front Row allies
- **Reaction:** Prevent ally Trauma by absorbing it yourself (at great personal cost)
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The living Runic Anchor—a walking kernel of stable code in a corrupted world

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Extremely high (Trauma prevention is game-changing)
- **Massive Cost:** Reaction inflicts huge Psychic Stress AND 1 Runic Blight Corruption
- **Once Per Combat:** Cannot be spammed
- **Position Requirement:** Passive aura requires Front Row positioning

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Skjaldmær has transcended the role of a mere warrior. She has become a **living Runic Anchor**—a walking kernel of stable code in a world of corrupted data. Her presence is a constant, calming hum of coherence, and in moments of ultimate crisis, she can absorb a reality-shattering blow meant for another's mind.

But such power demands sacrifice. To take another's Trauma is to accept their wounds into yourself. The Skjaldmær who uses this ability pays in both sanity and physical corruption.

### Thematic Resonance

This is the ultimate selfless act—literally taking someone else's mental scars. The Skjaldmær doesn't just protect allies from damage; she protects them from permanent psychological wounds, at the cost of her own coherence.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Component 1: Passive Aura

**Activation:** Always active while Skjaldmær is conscious and in Front Row

**Effect:**

**All allies in the same row as Skjaldmær gain:**

1. **WILL Bonus:** +1 to WILL attribute
2. **Environmental Stress Reduction:** -10% Psychic Stress from environmental sources (Blight-saturated areas, ambient corruption)

### Component 2: Trauma Absorption Reaction

**Trigger:** An ally would gain a permanent **Trauma** from reaching maximum Psychic Stress

**Cost:**

- Skjaldmær gains **Massive Psychic Stress** (50% of her maximum)
- Skjaldmær gains **1 Runic Blight Corruption**

**Effect:**

- The ally does **NOT** gain the Trauma
- Their Psychic Stress is reduced to 90% of maximum (still High, but not Breaking)
- Skjaldmær absorbs the psychic backlash

**Frequency:** Once per combat

### Resolution Pipeline (Reaction)

1. **Trauma Trigger:** Ally reaches maximum Psychic Stress, Trauma would be assigned
2. **Reaction Window:** Skjaldmær may declare Bastion of Sanity Reaction
3. **Cost Application:** Skjaldmær gains 50% max Psychic Stress + 1 Corruption
4. **Trauma Prevention:** Ally's Trauma is negated
5. **Stress Adjustment:** Ally's Stress reduced to 90% of maximum
6. **Frequency Lock:** Reaction cannot be used again this combat

### Worked Example

> **Scenario:** Jötun-Reader hits maximum Psychic Stress during analysis
> 

> - Jötun-Reader would gain [Paranoia] Trauma
> 

> 
> 

> **Skjaldmær activates Bastion of Sanity:**
> 

> - Skjaldmær (max Stress: 100) gains 50 Psychic Stress
> 

> - Skjaldmær gains 1 Runic Blight Corruption
> 

> - Jötun-Reader does NOT gain [Paranoia]
> 

> - Jötun-Reader's Stress reduced to 90% (still dangerous, but no permanent scar)
>

- **Reaction Cost:** 50% max Psychic Stress + 1 Corruption

### Rank 2 (Expert — 20 PP)

- **Passive:** +2 WILL, -15% environmental Stress to Front Row allies
- **Reaction:** Prevent ally Trauma (once per combat)
- **Reaction Cost:** 40% max Psychic Stress + 1 Corruption
- **New:** When using Reaction, Skjaldmær also gains 20 temporary HP

### Rank 3 (Mastery — Capstone)

- **Passive:** +2 WILL, -20% environmental Stress to ALL allies (any row)
- **Reaction:** Prevent ally Trauma (twice per combat)
- **Reaction Cost:** 30% max Psychic Stress + 1 Corruption

---

## V. Tactical Applications

1. **Trauma Insurance:** Party can operate more aggressively knowing Skjaldmær can catch Trauma events
2. **High-Stress Strategy:** Enable Jötun-Reader and other high-Stress builds to push limits
3. **Blight Exploration:** Passive aura makes corrupted areas significantly safer
4. **Emergency Save:** Prevent permanent character consequences in desperate moments
5. **Corruption Trade-off:** Accept physical corruption to prevent mental scarring

---

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Jötun-Reader:** Enables aggressive analysis without fear of permanent Trauma
- **Berserkr:** Low-WILL Berserkr benefits massively from +1 WILL aura
- **Skald (Saga of the Einherjar):** Can prevent Trauma from Einherjar termination Stress
- **Bone-Setter:** Can heal Skjaldmær's self-inflicted Stress after Reaction
- **Corruption-resistant builds:** Some equipment/abilities reduce Corruption impact

### Negative Synergies

- **Low-Corruption tolerance:** Skjaldmær accumulates Corruption through Reaction use
- **Solo play:** Passive aura requires Front Row allies to benefit
- **Back Row positioning:** Must be Front Row for aura to function
- **Multiple Trauma events:** Only one save per combat (two at Rank 3)
