## Thematic Description

> *"Plant your feet as the mountain plants its roots; let no force move what has chosen to stand."*
> 

Rooted Stance is the foundational philosophy of the Gorge-Maw Ascetic. By choosing **stillness over motion**, you connect with the earth's stability, gaining defensive power and resistance to displacement. The mountain does not chase; it waits.

## Synergies

### Internal (Gorge-Maw Tree)

- **Stone Skin**: Stacking Soak bonuses create massive damage reduction
- **Tremor Strike**: Generates Resonance while in stance
- **Tectonic Fury**: Capstone locks movement but enhances stance benefits

### External (Party Composition)

- **Mobile strikers**: You anchor while they maneuver
- **Ranged specialists**: Control enemies while archers fire freely
- **Controllers**: Your stability enables risky positioning

## Tactical Applications

### The Immovable Anchor

Rooted Stance defines the Gorge-Maw's role:

1. Choose your position **before combat**
2. **Never chase**—let enemies come to you
3. Build Resonance through stationary combat
4. Reshape terrain around your anchor point

### Rank 3: Passive Resonance

10 Resonance per turn while stationary enables:

- Faster buildup to Earthshaker (30 Resonance)
- Sustained Fissure creation (20 Resonance)
- Faster Tectonic Fury access (80 Resonance)
