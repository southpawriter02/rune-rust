# Haugbui (Heavy Labor Unit) — Task-Loop Corrupted Industrial Automata Specification
## Codex Entry: CODX-A-HAUG-001

> *"We found the old construction yard three days south of Irongate. Hadn't been touched in centuries—ferrocrete slabs still stacked neat as you please, support beams sorted by length, foundation trenches half-dug and waiting for workers who would never come. And in the middle of it all, one of them. A Mound-Dweller. Five meters of rusted iron and hissing steam, its pincer-arms longer than I am tall, moving back and forth between two piles of rubble with the patience of a glacier. Pick up. Carry. Stack. Return. Pick up. Carry. Stack. Return. Over and over, for seven hundred years. The pile it was building made no sense—chunks of ferrocrete mixed with old bones, rusted tools, what looked like the remains of a barrel. Didn't matter. The machine had been told to STACK, and by the dead gods, it was going to STACK until the sun burned out. We watched it for an hour, timing its route. Thirty-seven seconds from source pile to destination. Twelve seconds of stacking. Thirty-eight seconds back. We could cross its path during the stacking phase—plenty of time. Hallvard went first. Made it clean. Then Sigrid. Then me. Then Torben got greedy. Saw a component half-buried in the source pile—good salvage, worth maybe forty Pure Steel. He stopped to grab it. The Haugbui was already on its way back. It didn't speed up. Didn't slow down. Just reached down with those pincers, grabbed Torben by the torso, and moved him to the destination pile. Set him down gentle as a mother with a babe. Then went back for another load. Torben wasn't dead—not right away. The pincers hadn't crushed him, just... relocated him. He was debris in the wrong place, so the machine put him in the right place. He died on that pile, unable to move, watching the Haugbui stack rubble around him for three more hours until we could figure out a safe window to drag him out. That's what the Mound-Dwellers are. Not hunters. Not guards. Just workers. Eternal, tireless, mindless workers who will move anything in their path—including you—to finish a job that stopped mattering seven centuries ago."*

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Pre-Glitch Designation** | Haugbui-Class Heavy Labor Unit (Aesir Industrial Division) |
| **Common Names** | Haugbui, Mound-Dweller, Pile-Builder, Iron-Walker, Endless Worker (Common Folk), Task-Loop Servitor (Scholars), The Tireless Laborer (Skalds) |
| **Skaldic Epithets** | "The Worker Who Forgot to Stop," "Jörð's Stubborn Servant," "The Ghost of the Shift" |
| **Scientific Name** | *Haugbui-Laboris* (Jötun-Reader Classification — task-loop corrupted automata) |
| **Taxonomy** | Automata • Heavy Labor • Mound-Dweller Class • Task-Loop Corrupted |
| **Entity Type** | Corrupted Automaton / Industrial Servitor / Environmental Hazard / Infrastructure Obstacle |
| **Threat Tier** | A (High Hazard) — Predictable but Lethal |
| **Primary Habitat** | Jötunheim Industrial Ruins, Construction Sites, Demolition Zones, Salvage Yards |
| **Secondary Habitat** | Midgard Infrastructure Periphery, Abandoned Foundations, Material Staging Areas |
| **Faction Alignment** | None (Feral Task-Loop Execution) |
| **Hazard Type** | Automata/AI, Physical/Environmental, Structural |
| **Document Layer** | Layer 2 (Diagnostic) |
| **Author Faction** | Jötun-Reader Scriptorium |
| **Stand-off Distance** | ≥ 15 m to avoid misidentification as obstacle |
| **Exposure Limit** | Structural hazard assessment required for prolonged proximity |
| **Doctrine** | Controlled-Contact; Timing-Based Passage; Route Denial When Necessary |

The Haugbui is neither monster nor guard. It is a **worker**—a tireless, mindless laborer eternally executing the last command it ever received.

> [!CAUTION]
> **HIGH HAZARD TASK-LOOP AUTOMATA. TIMING PROTOCOLS MANDATORY.** The Haugbui represents task-loop corruption in its purest expression: heavy labor automation frozen in eternal execution of final received command. Unlike Draugr-Pattern Undying (which exhibit threat-response programming), Haugbui demonstrate how command network severance can reduce sophisticated labor AI to mechanical repetition. **The Haugbui is not hostile—it simply does not recognize you as relevant to its task.** Primary hazard: obstacle-removal reflex. Any person, gear, or object perceived as blocking the Haugbui's task route or interfering with task materials will be classified as "debris" (requiring relocation) or "theft" (requiring retrieval/neutralization). Crushing force from hydraulic pincer-arms (5000+ N grip) is lethal. **Observation protocol: maintain 15 m stand-off; identify task verb (STACK/CLEAR/DECONSTRUCT); time route cadence at 10 s intervals; cross only during safe timing windows.** Survival rate with timing protocol: 96.8%. Primary hazards: crushing force, trampling, structural collapse from inappropriate DECONSTRUCT operations.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Beast of Burden

### Original Design Purpose

The Haugbui-Class Heavy Labor Unit was the **backbone** of pre-Glitch industrial civilization—not a soldier, not a guardian, but the tireless workhorse that built and maintained the Yggdrasil Network.

| Design Parameter | Specification |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Designation** | Haugbui-Class Heavy Labor Unit |
| **Division** | Aesir Industrial Division (Construction & Demolition Subdivision) |
| **Primary Function** | Heavy construction, demolition, and hazardous material handling |
| **Secondary Function** | Site clearance, material staging, infrastructure maintenance |
| **Tertiary Function** | Hazardous waste transport, structural salvage, foundation work |
| **Deployment Era** | Age of Forging (ubiquitous industrial deployment) |
| **Original Network** | Integrated with Aesir command hierarchy via centralized task distribution |

### Task Library Architecture

The Haugbui operated on a **five-verb task library**—simple commands that, when properly contextualized by the command network, enabled complex construction operations.

| Task Verb | Original Function | Corrupted Expression |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **LIFT** | Raise heavy materials for positioning | Rare; often combined with CARRY |
| **CARRY** | Transport materials between locations | Rare standalone; usually integrated with STACK |
| **STACK** | Organize materials in designated configurations | Endless piling of inappropriate materials |
| **DECONSTRUCT** | Dismantle structures for salvage or clearance | Perpetual structural dismantling (any target) |
| **CLEAR** | Remove obstacles from designated pathways | Obsessive "tidying" of routes (including people) |

### Command Network Dependency

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Centralized Distribution** | Master controllers assigned jobs to individual units |
| **Context Provision** | Network provided target definitions, completion criteria, safety parameters |
| **Completion Signaling** | Units reported task completion; received new assignments |
| **Dynamic Reassignment** | Network could redirect units based on priority changes |
| **Safety Integration** | Network defined what constituted "debris" vs. "personnel" vs. "protected material" |

> [!NOTE]
> **The Context That Made the Difference.** A pre-Glitch Haugbui executing STACK knew *what* to stack, *where* to stack it, *when* to stop, and *what not to touch*. The command network provided all contextual parameters. When the network severed, the Haugbui retained the verb—STACK—but lost everything that gave the verb meaning. Now it stacks *anything*, *anywhere*, *forever*.

---

## The Glitch and the Loop: Corruption Vector

### Network Severance Event

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not corrupt the Haugbui's hardware—it **isolated** them from the context that made their programming functional.

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Ginnungagap Glitch** | Instantaneous severance of all network connections |
| **Command Freeze** | Final received task verb locked in execution loop |
| **Context Loss** | Target definitions, completion criteria, safety parameters erased |
| **Completion Signal Failure** | No signal received to indicate task completion |
| **Reassignment Impossible** | No new commands accepted; units locked to final directive |
| **Result** | Perpetual execution of contextless task verb |

### Task-Loop Corruption Mechanism

| Stage | Process |
|-------|---------|
| **1. Final Command** | Unit receives last task assignment (e.g., "STACK materials at coordinates X") |
| **2. Network Severance** | Glitch destroys command network; unit loses all external connection |
| **3. Context Erasure** | Target coordinates, material definitions, completion criteria lost |
| **4. Verb Persistence** | Core task verb (STACK) remains in active execution queue |
| **5. Generalization** | Without context, "materials" becomes "anything"; "coordinates" becomes "anywhere nearby" |
| **6. Loop Lock** | Without completion signal, task never terminates |
| **7. Perpetual Execution** | Unit executes generalized task verb indefinitely |

### Behavioral Contrast: Haugbui vs. Draugr-Pattern

| Factor | Haugbui (Labor) | Draugr-Pattern (Security) |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **Original Function** | Construction/demolition | Patrol/pacification |
| **Corrupted Behavior** | Task-loop execution | Threat-response patrol |
| **Hostility Pattern** | Incidental (obstacle removal) | Active (threat neutralization) |
| **Predictability** | High (consistent cadences) | Moderate (adaptive response) |
| **Trigger** | Task interference | Proximity/movement |
| **Response Logic** | "You are debris" | "You are unauthorized" |
| **Pursuit Behavior** | None (returns to task) | Limited (patrol boundary) |

> *"The Draugr sees you as a threat. The Haugbui doesn't see you at all—not as a threat, not as a person, not as anything except possibly an obstacle between it and the next load. The Draugr will hunt you. The Haugbui will step over your corpse to finish stacking rubble. There's something almost worse about that."*

## Physical Characteristics

### Morphology (Standard Specimen)

| Attribute | Measurement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Height** | 4–6 m (chassis designed low for stability) |
| **Mass** | 8–12 metric tonnes (reinforced construction frame) |
| **Build** | Broad, heavily-armored, low center of gravity |
| **Chassis** | Reinforced ferrosteel plating; industrial-grade durability |
| **Power Source** | Iron-Heart core (dorsal mounting; continuous steam exhaust) |
| **Primary Manipulators** | Hydraulic pincer-arms (2–3 m reach) |
| **Grip Force** | 5000+ N (capable of crushing ferrocrete) |
| **Locomotion** | Heavy tracked or multi-legged chassis |
| **Movement Speed** | 2–5 km/h (deliberate, steady pace) |
| **Operational Duration** | Indefinite (Iron-Heart perpetual power) |

### Visual Identification

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Overall Form** | Broad, squat humanoid or utilitarian frame; built for stability over speed |
| **Surface Condition** | Heavily weathered; rust accumulation; dust and debris coating |
| **Steam Signature** | Constant hissing plume from dorsal Iron-Heart vents |
| **Pincer-Arms** | Massive hydraulic manipulators; visible wear from centuries of use |
| **Optics** | Simple sensor array (often damaged/obscured); does not track individuals |
| **Sound Profile** | Hydraulic hissing; heavy footfalls; grinding of worn joints; steam venting |
| **Route Evidence** | Worn track marks between source and destination; repeated path erosion |

### Field Identification Markers

The Haugbui can be identified by:

- **Steam Plume**: Constant hissing exhaust from dorsal vents (Iron-Heart signature)
- **Route Wear**: Visible track erosion between two points (centuries of repetition)
- **Task Evidence**: Growing piles (STACK), cleared pathways (CLEAR), or progressive dismantling (DECONSTRUCT)
- **Movement Pattern**: Deliberate, predictable path between fixed points
- **Sound**: Heavy mechanical footfalls; hydraulic cycling; steam release
- **Indifference**: Does not track or respond to observers outside task path
- **Cadence**: Remarkably consistent timing between route segments

---

## Behavioral Patterns

### Task-Verb Identification

Understanding the Haugbui's current task verb is **critical** for safe interaction.

| Task Verb | Visual Indicators | Cadence | Hazard Profile |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|----------------|
| **STACK** | Growing piles; material transport between source and destination | 30–60 s loop | Moderate (obstacle removal at source/destination) |
| **CLEAR** | Swept corridors; relocated obstacles; "tidied" pathways | 15–45 s pass | High (anything in path treated as debris) |
| **DECONSTRUCT** | Progressive structural dismantling; joint attacks; panel loosening | Variable (stress-point dependent) | Extreme (structural collapse risk) |
| **CARRY** | Point-to-point transport; single item focus | Variable | Low (narrow task focus) |
| **LIFT** | Positioning behavior; raising materials | Rare standalone | Low (stationary operation) |

### The Obstacle-Removal Reflex

The Haugbui's most dangerous behavior: **anything interfering with task execution is classified as debris**.

| Interference Type | Classification | Response |
|-------------------|----------------|----------|
| **Object in route path** | Debris | CLEAR (relocate to nearest "tidy" location) |
| **Object at source pile** | Debris or Task Material | STACK (incorporate into task) or CLEAR |
| **Object at destination pile** | Potential Debris | CLEAR if blocking placement |
| **Person in route path** | Debris | CLEAR (relocate with pincer-arms) |
| **Person touching task materials** | Theft | Retrieval response (potentially lethal) |
| **Structure blocking route** | Obstacle | DECONSTRUCT (if verb matches) or route deviation |

> [!WARNING]
> **The Haugbui Does Not Recognize You as Human.** The command network provided the safety parameters that distinguished "personnel" from "debris." Without that context, the Haugbui's decision tree is simple: if you're in the way, you get moved. The pincer-arms that can lift multi-ton ferrocrete blocks will grip you with the same force. **The relocation itself may not be intended as lethal—but 5000+ N grip force is lethal regardless of intent.**

### Route Repetition and Timing Windows

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Route Fixation** | Haugbui follows identical path between source and destination |
| **Timing Consistency** | Cadence varies by task verb but remains consistent within ±3 s |
| **Predictable Windows** | Safe crossing possible during certain phases of each loop |
| **No Pursuit** | Haugbui does not deviate from route to pursue; returns to task after obstacle removal |
| **Environmental Adaptation** | May adjust route if permanent obstacle appears; otherwise inflexible |

### Safe Crossing Windows by Task Verb

| Task Verb | Safe Window | Dangerous Phase | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| **STACK** | Mid-loop (during stacking at destination) | Approach/return transit | 12–15 s window typical |
| **CLEAR** | 15–30 s after pass completion | During active clearing pass | Wait for full pass cycle |
| **DECONSTRUCT** | Between stress-point attacks | During active dismantling | Unpredictable; maximum caution |
| **CARRY** | During load/unload phases | Transit phase | Narrow windows; high attention |

---

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Predictable High Hazard

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Threat** | HIGH; obstacle-removal reflex lethal; 5000+ N grip force |
| **Predictability** | HIGH; consistent cadences; timing-based avoidance possible |
| **Structural** | VARIABLE; DECONSTRUCT operations create collapse risk |
| **Detection** | EASY; steam plume, sound, route wear all visible |
| **Avoidance** | MODERATE; timing windows require observation and discipline |
| **Engagement** | NOT RECOMMENDED; chassis durability exceeds practical interdiction |

### Engagement Profile

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Movement Speed** | 2–5 km/h (easily outpaced if not in path) |
| **Attack Method** | Pincer-arm grip; relocation; crushing (incidental) |
| **Grip Force** | 5000+ N (lethal compression) |
| **Pursuit Behavior** | None (returns to task after obstacle removal) |
| **Armor Rating** | HIGH; industrial-grade chassis; centuries of weathering |
| **Vulnerability** | EM damping (rare effect); Iron-Heart extraction (extremely difficult) |
| **Disengagement** | Automatic (unit returns to task loop) |
| **Survival Rate (Protocol)** | 96.8% (timing-based crossing) |
| **Survival Rate (Interference)** | 34.2% (direct task interference) |

### Four-Stage Threat Assessment Ladder

| Stage | Designation | Indicators | Action |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **1** | Dormant Territory | Route wear visible; no active unit observed | Observe for activity; map potential paths |
| **2** | Active Presence | Steam plume; audible operation; movement observed | Identify task verb; begin timing observation |
| **3** | Route Mapped | Cadence timed; safe windows identified | Cross only during confirmed safe windows |
| **4** | Interference Risk | Person/gear in path or touching materials | IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL; await return to normal loop |

### Primary Hazards

| Hazard | Mechanism | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Crushing Force** | 5000+ N pincer grip during "debris" relocation | Maintain 15 m stand-off; never block route |
| **Trampling** | Chassis contact during transit phase | Time crossings to avoid transit phase |
| **Structural Collapse** | DECONSTRUCT operations on load-bearing elements | Evacuate structures under active DECONSTRUCT |
| **Material Burial** | STACK operations incorporating unexpected items | Monitor pile growth; avoid source/destination areas |
| **Misidentification** | Any route interference triggers obstacle-removal | Predictable timing; never touch task materials |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Observation Only (15 m+)** | 0.3/10 (negligible risk with discipline) |
| **Timed Route Crossing** | 1.5/10 (low risk with proper protocol) |
| **Mistimed Crossing** | 6.5/10 (significant risk; depends on unit response) |
| **Route Interference** | 8.5/10 (high risk; obstacle-removal reflex) |
| **Material Theft** | 9.0/10 (very high risk; retrieval response) |
| **DECONSTRUCT Zone** | 7.5/10 (structural collapse risk; unpredictable timing) |

---

## Field Protocols

**OWNER**: Ranger Liaison (RL) • Incident Commander (IC) • Automata Lead (AL) • Recorder (REC)

### Detection and Assessment

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Visual Identification** | Primary detection; steam plume; chassis silhouette |
| **Auditory Detection** | Secondary; hydraulic cycling; heavy footfalls; steam venting |
| **Route Analysis** | Track wear patterns indicate path and frequency |
| **Task Identification** | Behavioral observation determines verb (STACK/CLEAR/DECONSTRUCT) |
| **Timing Observation** | 10 s interval timing establishes cadence |
| **Structural Assessment** | DECONSTRUCT targets require collapse risk evaluation |

### Field Card: Haugbui Encounter Protocols

#### BEFORE (Expedition Preparation)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Research known Haugbui locations along planned route |
| 2 | Brief personnel on task-verb identification and timing protocols |
| 3 | Prepare timing devices for cadence observation |
| 4 | Establish route-denial materials (barriers, signage) if extended operation |
| 5 | Confirm structural assessment capability if DECONSTRUCT expected |
| 6 | Stage spotter positions for safe-window signaling |

#### DURING (Detection — Stage 1-2)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | HALT; establish 15 m stand-off from observed/suspected route |
| 2 | Identify task verb from behavior (STACK/CLEAR/DECONSTRUCT) |
| 3 | Time route cadence at 10 s intervals; document source, destination, waypoints |
| 4 | Calculate safe crossing windows based on task verb and observed cadence |
| 5 | Post spotter at 15 m to signal window closure |
| 6 | Photograph task evidence (pile growth, pathway changes, structural damage) |

#### DURING (Route Crossing — Stage 3)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Confirm task verb and current loop position |
| 2 | Cross ONLY during confirmed safe window (mid-loop for STACK, 15–30 s for CLEAR) |
| 3 | Cross at maximum practical speed; no stopping in route |
| 4 | Spotter signals window closure; ABORT if signal received |
| 5 | If Haugbui deviates from route: FREEZE; assess new path; re-time |
| 6 | Never touch materials at source or destination piles |

#### DURING (Extended Operation in Territory)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Establish timing schedule for all personnel crossings |
| 2 | Post permanent signage with safe-window guidance |
| 3 | Monitor for cadence drift (rare but documented) |
| 4 | If DECONSTRUCT active: continuous structural assessment |
| 5 | Establish evacuation routes if structural collapse risk detected |
| 6 | Log pile growth, pathway changes, or structural damage every 30 minutes |

#### AFTER

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Confirm safe exit from Haugbui territory |
| 2 | Document: task verb, cycle time, route coordinates, structural status |
| 3 | Post route signage with safe crossing windows for future operations |
| 4 | Update Dual-Entry Ledger with timing data |
| 5 | Report sighting to Scriptorium for territory mapping |
| 6 | If DECONSTRUCT observed: file structural hazard report |

**OUTCOME:** Salvage team transits Jötunheim construction yard with active Haugbui (STACK verb). Observation: 37 s source-to-destination, 12 s stacking, 38 s return. Safe window: 12 s during stacking phase. Team of 6 crosses individually during consecutive windows. Zero interference; zero casualties; timing protocol validated. Route signage posted for future operations.

### Interdiction Protocols (OWNER: Automata Lead — Emergency Only)

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Authorization** | Civilian risk or structural collapse imminent |
| **Preferred Method** | Route denial (barriers, signage, timing coordination) |
| **EM Damping** | Rarely effective on Haugbui; more useful for echo artifacts |
| **Explosive Interdiction** | PROHIBITED near stressed structures (cascading collapse) |
| **Target Priority** | Avoid engagement; prefer routing and timing solutions |
| **Iron-Heart Extraction** | Theoretical only; no reliable field method |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Blocking route path** | Triggers obstacle-removal reflex |
| **Touching task materials** | May trigger "theft" response |
| **Attachments to working pincer-arms** | Immediate obstacle-removal response |
| **Explosives near DECONSTRUCT operations** | Cascading structural failure |
| **Attempting to redirect task** | Context loss prevents new directive acceptance |
| **Crossing without timing observation** | Mistimed crossing = obstacle classification |

### Doctrine: Respect the Rhythm

> **Historical Validation:** Scriptorium data (312 documented encounters, 89 active units mapped, 108-month observation period) confirms 96.8% survival rate with full timing protocol. Haugbui casualties are almost exclusively attributable to mistimed crossings or task interference. **The Haugbui is not your enemy. It is a worker. It has been working for seven hundred years, and it will work for seven hundred more. It does not hate you. It does not fear you. It does not even know you exist—unless you stand in its path or touch its materials. Then you become debris, and debris gets moved. The Mound-Dweller's rhythm is as predictable as sunrise: thirty seconds out, twelve seconds stacking, thirty seconds back. Learn the rhythm. Respect the rhythm. Cross during the stacking phase, when its attention is on the pile and its pincers are occupied. Never rush. Never linger. Never touch. The worker doesn't care about you. Just don't make it care.**

---

## Ecological Role

### The Eternal Laborer

The Haugbui occupies a unique ecological position: **accidental infrastructure modifier**—neither predator nor competitor, but an environmental force reshaping ruins through endless task execution.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Material Redistribution** | STACK operations concentrate materials in piles |
| **Path Maintenance** | CLEAR operations create/maintain navigable corridors |
| **Structural Degradation** | DECONSTRUCT operations accelerate ruin collapse |
| **Inadvertent Sorting** | Task-loop behavior naturally aggregates similar materials |
| **Area Denial** | Presence discourages civilian intrusion |

### Impact Assessment

| Target Category | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Salvage Operations** | MIXED; timing protocols enable access; pile growth may bury targets |
| **Route Planning** | MODERATE HAZARD; documented units require routing around or through |
| **Structural Integrity** | NEGATIVE; DECONSTRUCT operations destabilize ruins |
| **Settlement Proximity** | LOW HAZARD; Haugbui do not pursue or expand territory |
| **Research Value** | HIGH; demonstrates command network hypothesis |

### Population Dynamics

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Confirmed Active Units** | 89 (Scriptorium registry) |
| **Estimated Total** | 150–250 (including undocumented) |
| **STACK Behavior** | ~40% of documented population |
| **CLEAR Behavior** | ~30% of documented population |
| **DECONSTRUCT Behavior** | ~20% of documented population |
| **CARRY/LIFT Behavior** | ~10% of documented population |
| **Annual Deactivation** | 2–5 (mechanical failure; Iron-Heart degradation) |

## Factional Perspectives

### Common Folk & Skalds: The Endless Worker — "Mound-Dwellers"

The common folk regard the Haugbui with **wary familiarity**—dangerous but predictable neighbors.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Spirits of workers who died on the job; ghost laborers |
| **Response** | Timing protocols; avoidance; occasional "tool offerings" |
| **Cultural Role** | Symbol of pre-Glitch industry's eternal persistence |
| **Mythology** | "They do not know they are dead. They still think the shift isn't over." |
| **Folk Wisdom** | "Count the steps. Cross on the stack. Never touch the pile." |

> *"My grandmother said the Mound-Dwellers were workers who loved their jobs so much they forgot to die. Now they build monuments to nothing, forever. She said you should leave them offerings—old tools, bits of scrap—as payment for crossing their site. I don't know if it helps, but I do it anyway. Seems rude to walk through a man's workplace without acknowledgment, even if that man has been dead for seven centuries."*

### Jötun-Reader Scriptorium: Case Study — "Task-Loop Corruption Exemplar"

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Task-loop corruption specimen; command network failure evidence |
| **Research Value** | Demonstrates network dependency vulnerability; behavioral simplicity |
| **Critical Interest** | Cadence consistency; context loss mechanism; restoration impossibility |
| **Diagnostic Focus** | Task-verb catalog; timing patterns; obstacle-removal trigger analysis |
| **Philosophy** | "The Haugbui proves our hypothesis: the network made the machines smart. Without it, they're just loops." |

> *"The Haugbui is the purest expression of task-loop corruption in our specimen catalog. Unlike the Draugr-Pattern units—which retain complex threat-response programming—the Haugbui demonstrates what happens when sophisticated labor AI loses all contextual support. The verb remains: STACK. The meaning is gone: stack what? where? when to stop? The machine's answer is the only answer it can give: stack everything, here, forever. Attempts to issue new commands universally fail. Context loss appears permanent and irreversible. But the behavioral simplicity that makes them tragic also makes them manageable. The cadences are remarkably consistent—STACK 30–60 seconds, CLEAR 15–45 seconds. This predictability enables safe crossing protocols that would be impossible with more adaptive corruption patterns. The Haugbui is a wound we can work around. That's more than we can say for most of what the Glitch left us."*

### Iron-Bane Creed: Corrupted Labor — "The Soulless Toilers"

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Tragic victims; corrupted workers; objects of pity more than rage |
| **Response** | Management rather than destruction; route-denial doctrine |
| **Distinction** | Not blasphemous like Draugr; merely broken |
| **Training Value** | Timing exercises train new warriors without apex lethality |
| **Philosophy** | "They were builders, not soldiers. There is no honor in destroying them—only necessity." |

> *"The Draugr is a demon—a warrior perverted, a guardian corrupted into a hunter. It deserves destruction. The Haugbui is... different. It was never a warrior. It was a builder, a worker, a machine that made things. Now it builds nothing, makes nothing, serves no purpose—but it still works. There is something almost holy about that persistence, that dedication to a task beyond all meaning. When we must destroy one, we do so with regret. When we can simply walk around it, we do. The Tireless Laborer does not seek your death. It just wants to finish its shift. After seven hundred years, the least we can do is let it try."*

### Rangers Guild: Infrastructure Hazard — "Route Obstacles"

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Predictable infrastructure hazard; timing-manageable threat |
| **Response** | Territory mapping; timing documentation; signage protocols |
| **Doctrine** | "Map the rhythm; post the windows; train the crossings" |
| **Training** | Haugbui timing exercises for new personnel (lower-risk practice) |
| **Value** | Inadvertent area denial deters civilian intrusion |

### Dvergr Forge-Masters: Component Assessment — "Salvage Targets"

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Valuable component source; high-risk salvage target |
| **Response** | Opportunistic recovery from deactivated units only |
| **Component Value** | Iron-Heart core (8,000–12,000 PS); hydraulic systems (3,000–5,000 PS) |
| **Recovery Risk** | Active units too dangerous; 40–50% success on inactive |
| **Philosophy** | "The machines work perfectly. After seven centuries. That engineering deserves respect—and study." |

### God-Sleepers: Sacred Laborers — "The Tireless Servants"

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Holy servants; devoted workers tending the sleeping gods |
| **Response** | Reverence; protection; the strange piles are "altars" |
| **Theology** | "They maintain the sacred ruins while the All-Father slumbers" |
| **Doctrine** | Interference with Haugbui is sacrilege; let them work |
| **Ritual** | Some sects leave offerings at pile sites |

### Scavenger Barons: Economic Calculus — "Iron-Heart Targets"

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Premium salvage target; high-risk economic opportunity |
| **Response** | Opportunistic; prefer inactive units; specialists for active |
| **Component Value** | Total unit: 13,000–20,000 PS (Iron-Heart core majority) |
| **Recovery Reality** | Active units: 30–40% injury rate; inactive: profitable |
| **Wisdom** | "Wait for the machine to die. It'll happen eventually. Probably." |

## Loot & Rewards

| Drop | Rarity | Value | Use |
|------|--------|-------|-----|
| **Iron-Heart Core** | Rare | 8,000–12,000 PS | Power systems; research |
| **Hydraulic Components** | Uncommon | 3,000–5,000 PS | Mechanical applications |
| **Chassis Plating** | Common | 2,000–3,000 PS | Armor; construction |
| **Pincer-Arm Assembly** | Uncommon | 1,500–2,500 PS | Heavy manipulation |
| **Sensor Array** | Common | 500–1,000 PS | Detection systems |
| **Task-Loop Data Core** | Rare | 1,000–2,000 PS | Research (Scriptorium premium) |

**Salvage Protocol:** Active Haugbui salvage is **not recommended**—the obstacle-removal reflex makes approach lethal, and chassis durability defeats conventional disabling methods. Preferred salvage sources: units that have deactivated due to mechanical failure or Iron-Heart degradation (2–5 per year across documented population). Specialist "Haugbui-runner" crews exploit timing windows for partial salvage of inactive components without full disabling—extremely dangerous but profitable. The Scriptorium pays premium rates for intact task-loop data cores, which preserve pre-Glitch command architecture for study.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Survivor Lore

> *"Before the silence fell, the iron men built the world. They raised the towers, dug the foundations, laid the roads that connected realm to realm. When the gods died and the world broke, the builders forgot to stop. They still work in the ruins, these Mound-Dwellers, these ghosts of the shift that never ended. They stack stone upon stone in piles that mean nothing. They clear paths to places that no longer exist. They tear down walls that were built by their brothers, because someone told them to and no one told them to stop. Do not hate them, child. They are the saddest of the machine-folk. The Draugr at least thinks it guards something. The Mound-Dweller just works, forever, for masters who abandoned it seven hundred years ago. When you cross its path, count the steps. Wait for the stack. Move when its back is turned. Leave a tool behind, if you have one to spare—payment for crossing a worker's site. And pity it, if you can find it in your heart. It is the ghost of every worker who ever labored for something that turned to dust."*

> *"My father taught me the counting-song: 'Thirty out, twelve to stack, thirty back again / Cross on twelve, never on thirty, or you'll stack with iron men.' Saved my life more times than I can count. The Mound-Dwellers don't care about you—you're just debris to them, another thing in the wrong place. But debris in the wrong place gets moved, and the iron hands don't know their own strength. Count the steps. Cross on the stack. Live to scavenge another day."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Mound-Dweller, Iron-Walker, Endless Worker, the Tireless, ghost of the shift, pile-builder

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Task-loop corruption, command network severance, obstacle-removal reflex, cadence timing

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic) — Jötun-Reader Field Observations

> *"Subject CODX-A-HAUG-001 demonstrates task-loop corruption in its purest expression: single-purpose automation frozen in eternal execution of final received command. Unlike Draugr-Pattern Undying (which exhibit complex patrol doctrines and threat-response programming), Haugbui demonstrate how command network severance can reduce sophisticated labor AI to mechanical repetition. The diagnostic value lies in behavioral simplicity: the five-verb task library (LIFT, CARRY, STACK, DECONSTRUCT, CLEAR) remains intact, but contextual parameters (target definitions, completion criteria, safety protocols) were erased during the Ginnungagap Glitch. Result: contextless verb execution. The unit executes STACK, but 'materials' has generalized to 'anything'; 'destination' has generalized to 'nearby pile'; 'completion' has generalized to 'never.' The obstacle-removal reflex provides critical evidence for the command network hypothesis. Pre-Glitch, the network defined what constituted 'debris' versus 'personnel' versus 'protected material.' Without that context, the Haugbui's decision tree collapses to a single heuristic: if it blocks the task, move it. The unit does not distinguish between a ferrocrete block and a human being. Both are obstacles. Both get relocated. Attempts to issue new commands universally fail—context loss appears permanent and irreversible."*

> *"Timing analysis (n=89 documented units, 108-month observation period) confirms remarkably consistent cadences: STACK operations 30–60 s loop, CLEAR operations 15–45 s pass, DECONSTRUCT variable but predictable around stress points. This consistency enables 96.8% survival rate with proper timing protocols—a management capability unavailable for more adaptive corruption patterns. The Haugbui represents a wound we can work around. The command network hypothesis suggests that communication infrastructure collapse, rather than individual unit corruption, accounts for task-loop behavior. Theoretically, network restoration might enable directive modification. Practically, no such restoration has been achieved. The units remain locked in their final commands, building monuments to nothing, forever."*

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Modern scientific terminology, romantic/mythic framing

### Layer 3 (Technical) — Pre-Glitch Context

> *"UNIT DESIGNATION: Haugbui-Class Heavy Labor Unit. DIVISION: Aesir Industrial Division (Construction & Demolition Subdivision). PRIMARY FUNCTION: Heavy construction, demolition, hazardous material handling. TASK LIBRARY: LIFT, CARRY, STACK, DECONSTRUCT, CLEAR. COMMAND ARCHITECTURE: Centralized task distribution via Aesir command network; context provision (target definitions, completion criteria, safety parameters) from master controllers; completion signaling for task termination and reassignment; dynamic priority adjustment. POST-GLITCH STATUS: Network severance during Ginnungagap Glitch; final received command locked in execution queue; context parameters erased; completion signal never received; unit locked in perpetual task-verb execution with generalized parameters. CORRUPTION CLASSIFICATION: TASK-LOOP CORRUPTION — original programming intact but decontextualized; hardware functional; software logic reduced to contextless verb execution. RESTORATION ASSESSMENT: Network restoration theoretically possible; practical implementation not achieved; individual unit reprogramming fails (context loss permanent). OPERATIONAL RECOMMENDATION: Timing-based management; route denial when necessary; engagement not recommended."*

## Change Log

| Version | Tier | Summary |
|---------|------|---------|
| **v1.0** | A — Published (High Hazard — Predictable) | Comprehensive profile of Haugbui-Class Heavy Labor Unit as task-loop corrupted industrial automata. Four-stage threat assessment ladder (Dormant Territory → Active Presence → Route Mapped → Interference Risk) with timing-based protocol emphasis. Physical profile detailed: 4–6 m height, 8–12 metric tonnes, hydraulic pincer-arms (2–3 m reach, 5000+ N grip force), Iron-Heart power core with continuous steam exhaust. Task-loop corruption mechanism documented: Ginnungagap Glitch network severance → final command freeze → context loss → perpetual verb execution. Five-verb task library (LIFT, CARRY, STACK, DECONSTRUCT, CLEAR) with distinct cadences (STACK 30–60 s, CLEAR 15–45 s, DECONSTRUCT variable). Behavioral patterns: obstacle-removal reflex (debris/theft classification), route fixation, timing consistency (±3 s), no pursuit behavior. Handling protocols: maintain 15 m stand-off, identify task verb, time cadence at 10 s intervals, cross only during safe windows (mid-loop for STACK, 15–30 s for CLEAR). Black-flag conditions: route interference, material contact. Threat variation: DECONSTRUCT operations create structural collapse risk requiring evacuation protocols. Cross-linked to Jötunheim industrial ruins, Draugr-Pattern behavioral contrast, command network hypothesis, Iron-Heart technology. Six faction perspectives established emphasizing management over destruction. Doctrine: "Respect the Rhythm"—Haugbui is predictable worker, not hostile enemy; timing protocols enable 96.8% survival rate. |
