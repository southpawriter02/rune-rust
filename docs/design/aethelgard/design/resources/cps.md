**# Cognitive Paradox Syndrome (CPS) — The Static Sickness**

> *"It starts with a sound. Not a sound you hear with your ears, but a sound you feel behind your eyes. Like the hum of a wasp caught in a jar, but the jar is your skull. You try to sleep, but the hum gets louder. You try to read, but the letters start to crawl like spiders. You try to remember your mother's face, but all you see is geometry—shapes that shouldn't exist, angles that cut your mind just by thinking of them. They call it Ruin-Madness. I call it the truth. The world is broken, boy. And if you look at the broken pieces too long, they don't just cut your eyes. They cut the part of you that knows who you are."*

## I. Overview

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Common Names** | Static Sickness, Ruin-Madness, The Weight of Knowing, The Un-Writing, Glimmer-Madness |
| **Medical Classification** | Informational Pathogen / Neuro-Aetheric Dissonance |
| **Technical Designation** | `COGNITOHAZARD.TYPE-GAMMA` (Post-Glitch Pathology) |
| **Vector** | Runic Blight Exposure (Visual/Auditory/Aetheric) |
| **Incubation** | Instant to Chronic (Cumulative Exposure) |
| **Lethality** | 100% if untreated past Stage 2 |
| **H-Index** | Variable (Stage 1: Low → Stage 4: Critical) |
| **Document Layer** | Layer 2 (Diagnostic) |
| **Author Faction** | Jötun-Reader Scriptorium, Division of Post-Glitch Pathology |
| **Status** | ENDEMIC HAZARD |

The mind is a machine designed to process logic. The Glitch is pure anti-logic. **CPS is the friction of a logical engine grinding against an impossible reality.**

> [!DANGER]
> 

> **INFORMATIONAL HAZARD. MEMETIC CORRUPTION.**
> 

> CPS is not a biological disease. It is the result of the brain attempting to parse **paradoxical data structures** inherent to the Runic Blight. Exposure to "raw" Aether, corrupted runes, or Glitch-entities forces the observer's neural architecture to solve unsolvable equations.
> 

> **Operational Protocol:** Limit Line-of-Sight (LOS) to paradox sources; maintain "Cognitive Hygiene" (avoid deep focus on anomalies); immediate "Silent Room" isolation for Stage 1 symptoms. **Stage 2+ is considered irreversible in field conditions.**

## II. Pre-Glitch Origins: The Occupational Hazard

### Original Context

In the Age of Forging, **Cognitive Paradox Syndrome** was an extremely rare, specialized occupational hazard reserved for **Deep-Dive Architects** and **O.D.I.N. Sys-Admins**. These individuals worked directly with the raw, non-Euclidean code structures of the Yggdrasil Network's kernel.

| Operational Context | Function |
| --- | --- |
| **Kernel Architects** | Direct manipulation of reality-source-code |
| **Aether-Divers** | Deep-immersion maintenance of the Aetheric substrate |
| **Safety Protocols** | "Reality Buffers" and "Cognitive Filters" (Augmented Reality overlays) |

### The Filtered Reality

The Aesir understood that the human mind could not comprehend the raw mathematical chaos of the universe's backend. They built **Cognitive Filters**—neural interface protocols that translated raw code into comprehensible sensory data.

- **Raw Data:** A 12-dimensional recursive fractal equation.
- **Filtered Data:** A tree. A wall. A gust of wind.

CPS occurred only when these filters failed during deep-dive operations, exposing a technician to "The Naked Truth." It was treated with mandatory sabbatical and memory-edits.

### Core Technical Specification

```jsx
O.D.I.N. MED-LOG v4.2 — COGNITIVE HEALTH
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DIAGNOSIS: Neural Dissonance (Code 77-B)
CAUSE: Buffer overflow in Neural Interface; direct exposure to Kernel-Level Recursion.
SYMPTOMS:
- Semantic drift (words lose meaning)
- Geometry hallucinations
- Logic-lock (catatonic recursive thought)
TREATMENT:
> EXECUTE PROTOCOL.RESET --MEMORY_WIPE=[LAST_24H]
> REBOOT NEURAL_FILTER
STATUS: MANAGEABLE. INCIDENCE RATE <0.0001%.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 

> **The Great Safety Rail.** The entire pre-Glitch civilization was built behind a safety rail of Augmented Reality and Neural Filters. The Aesir didn't just build the world; they built the *lens* through which humanity viewed it, ensuring that the chaos of creation looked like a garden.
>

## III. The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Filters Shatter

When the Glitch struck, it didn't just break the machines. **It crashed the filters.**

The "Safety Rail" vanished. Suddenly, every human mind on Aethelgard was exposed to the raw, corrupted, screaming source code of a dying god-machine.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
| --- | --- |
| **Pattern Recognition** | ACTIVE; the brain *desperately* tries to find patterns |
| **Sensory Input** | ACTIVE; eyes/ears receive raw Blight data |
| **Logic Processing** | OVERCLOCKED; mind runs hot trying to solve paradoxes |

### What Was Lost

| System | Status |
| --- | --- |
| **Cognitive Filters** | DESTROYED; no translation layer exists |
| **Reality Buffers** | OFFLINE; paradoxes manifest physically |
| **Safety Protocols** | DELETED; no auto-reset or memory wipes |

### The Corrupted Imperative

The post-Glitch mind is a pattern-seeking engine in a world of anti-patterns.

**The Mechanism of Injury:**

1. **Observation:** Subject views a Glitch-anomaly (e.g., a wall that is both there and not there).
2. **Processing:** The brain attempts to reconcile the logical contradiction.
3. **Friction:** The logic center overheats. Synapses fire in recursive loops trying to make $1 = 0$.
4. **Dissolution:** To survive, the brain "un-writes" its own logic centers. The subject stops trying to make sense and simply *accepts* the madness. This is the onset of Stage 3.

---

## IV. Clinical Progression: The Four Stages

CPS is not a binary state (Sane/Insane). It is a measurable, progressive slide into dissolution, tracked mechanically via **Psychic Stress**.

### Stage 1: The Weight of Knowing (Initial Onset)

*The mind begins to strain under the load of processing anti-logic.*

- **Mechanical Trigger:** 20-49% Psychic Stress
- **Symptoms:** Migraines ("The Pressure"), high-pitched tinnitus ("The Static Hiss"), mild auditory paresthesia (hearing whispers in wind), irritability.
- **UI/Perception Effect:** "Uneasy" state. Minor visual static in peripheral vision. Text may occasionally flicker.
- **Field Sign:** Subject frequently rubs temples, asks "Did you hear that?", or stares at geometry for too long.
- **Prognosis:** Reversible. Requires "Cognitive Hygiene" (rest, silence, darkness).

### Stage 2: Glimmer-Madness (Sensory Distortion)

*The filters are gone. The brain starts interpreting noise as signal.*

- **Mechanical Trigger:** 50-79% Psychic Stress
- **Symptoms:** Visual hallucinations (fractals overlaying vision), "The Writhing Text" (letters rearrange themselves), vertigo, semantic drift (forgetting names of common objects).
- **UI/Perception Effect:** "Anxious" to "Panicked" state. Overt UI distortion (leetspeak intrusion: E→3, O→0). HUD elements glitch. Reality seems to "lag."
- **Field Sign:** Subject responds to stimuli that aren't there; describes colors that don't exist; cannot read written text reliably.
- **Prognosis:** Critical. Immediate extraction required. "Silent Room" protocol mandatory.

### Stage 3: Ruin-Madness (Logic Collapse)

*The logic center shatters. The subject accepts the paradox.*

- **Mechanical Trigger:** 80-99% Psychic Stress
- **Symptoms:** Violent paranoia, "Logic-Locks" (repeating a physical action or phrase endlessly), loss of self-identity, worship of anomalies.
- **UI/Perception Effect:** "Breaking" state. Severe UI illegibility. Data log intrusions override reality. Constant "System Warning" overlays.
- **Field Sign:** Subject attempts to interact with hazardous anomalies; speaks in "Word-Salad" (random technical/mythic jargon); hostility to "un-enlightened" teammates.
- **Prognosis:** Terminal. The person is gone. Only the shell remains.

### Stage 4: The Hollow Shell (The Un-Written)

*The mind is erased. The body is a vessel for the Blight.*

- **Mechanical Trigger:** 100% Psychic Stress (Terminal Error)
- **Symptoms:** Catatonia, or "Hollow behavior" (mimicking sounds/actions without comprehension). The Hamingja (soul) is effectively overwritten by ambient Blight-noise.
- **UI/Perception Effect:** Black screen or "Blue Screen of Death" equivalent. Total system crash.
- **Field Sign:** No pupillary response. Echo-lalia. Complete lack of survival instinct.
- **Prognosis:** None. Subject is technically a biological automaton.

## V. Hazard Assessment & Mechanics

### Classification: Informational / Cognitive Hazard

| Hazard | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Direct Threat (Self)** | Neuro-degeneration, self-harm, stroke |
| **Threat to Unit** | Sabotage, violent outbursts, compromise of mission operational security |
| **Contagion** | **Memetic.** Observing a Stage 3 subject's behavior can accelerate Stage 1 in observers. |

### H-Index Rating (Variable)

| Parameter | Value | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **V (Volatility)** | 2 | Slow onset, but spikes with intense exposure |
| **C (Consequence)** | 4 | Permanent loss of personnel (Mind-Death) |
| **O (Onset)** | 2 | Cumulative load tracking required |
| **K (Kill Chain)** | 1 | Rarely kills directly; secondary hazards kill |
| **S (Survivability)** | 3 | High if caught at Stage 1; Zero at Stage 3 |
| **Composite** | **12 (Moderate to High)** | **Endemic Operational Risk** |

---

## VI. Game Specification: Psychic Stress Mechanics

### The Stress Track

CPS is modeled via the **Psychic Stress** mechanic, a core resource in the **Trauma Economy**.

- **Max Stress:** 100 (Universal Cap)
- **Resistance:** **Mental Resolve Check** (WILL dice pool vs Stress DC).
    - *Success:* Reduces incoming Stress by 1 per success.
    - *Failure:* Full Stress applied.

### Stress Accumulation Sources

| Source | Stress | Resist? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Environmental** |  |  |  |
| [Psychic Resonance] Zone | 5-10 / turn | YES (DC 2) | Passive area effect |
| Corpse Discovery | 5 | YES (DC 1) | "The Dead do not dream." |
| Paradox Encounter | 10-25 | YES (DC 4) | Witnessing a logic-break |
| **Combat** |  |  |  |
| Enemy Fear Aura | 10-20 | YES (DC 2) | Forlorn or Boss presence |
| Psychic Attack | 1:1 Damage | NO | Damage dealt = Stress gained |
| Witnessing Ally Death | 15 | YES (DC 2) | "Unit offline." |
| **Heretical Actions** |  |  |  |
| Psychic Lash (Use) | 10 | NO | Self-inflicted cost of power |
| Mass Psychic Lash | 20 | NO | High-cost power |
| Reading Forbidden Text | 10-25 | YES (DC 3) | "The words... they move." |

### Stress Thresholds & Penalties

As Stress accumulates, the character's ability to process reality degrades, represented by penalties to **Defense** (the ability to predict and avoid danger).

| Tier | Range | State | Defense Penalty | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0** | 0-19 | Calm | 0 | Normal operation |
| **1** | 20-39 | Uneasy | -1 | Minor UI static |
| **2** | 40-59 | Anxious | -2 | Leetspeak text, auditory hallucinations |
| **3** | 60-79 | Panicked | -3 | Major distortion, Disadvantage on Logic |
| **4** | 80-99 | Breaking | -4 | Severe distortion, "Breaking Point" imminent |
| **5** | 100 | **TRAUMA** | -5 | **Trauma Check Triggered** |

### The Breaking Point (Trauma Check)

When Stress reaches 100, the character hits their **Breaking Point**.

- **Mechanic:** Immediate **WILL vs DC 16** Check.
- **Critical Success (4+ successes):** **Heroic Moment.** Stress resets to 60. Gain +1 Legend Point.
- **Success (1-3 successes):** **Stabilized.** Stress resets to 75. Gain [Disoriented] (2 turns).
- **Failure (0 successes):** **Trauma.** Stress resets to 50. Gain [Stunned] (1 turn). Gain 1 **Permanent Trauma**.
- **Critical Failure (Botch):** **Terminal Error.** Stress resets to 50. Gain [Stunned] (2 turns). Gain **Severe Trauma** or enter Stage 4 (Retired).

## VII. The Panic Table (Stage 3 Effects)

If a character fails a Logic Save or enters Stage 3 combat stress, roll `d10`:

| d10 | Effect | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1-2** | **Freeze (Logic Lock)** | Character loses all actions this turn. Stares at a geometric anomaly. |
| **3-4** | **Flight (Evacuation Protocol)** | Character spends all movement fleeing the source of stress. "Abort! Abort!" |
| **5-6** | **Fight (Paradox Fury)** | Character attacks nearest entity (friend or foe). "Silence the noise!" |
| **7** | **Babble (Word Salad)** | Character shouts nonsensical technical jargon. -5 Stealth to party. |
| **8** | **Self-Harm (Purge)** | Character inflicts 1d6 damage to self to "let the pressure out." |
| **9** | **Hallucination (Phantom Data)** | Character treats empty space as cover or a wall. |
| **10** | **Catatonia (System Crash)** | Character falls Prone and [Stunned] for 1d4 rounds. |

## VIII. Field Protocols & Treatment

**OWNER**: Bone-Setter (BS) • Runestalker (RS) • Field Medic (FM)

### Detection and Early Warning

- **The Baseline Test:** A simple logic puzzle or reading test administered every 4 hours in the field.
    - *Scribe's Check:* "Read this sentence back to me." (Failure indicates Stage 2 Writhing Text).
    - *Logic Check:* "What is your name? What year is it? What is 2 + 2?"
- **Observation:** Watch for "The Stare" (fixation on anomalies) or "The Rub" (constant temple massaging).

### Field Card: CPS Management

### BEFORE (Preparation)

| Priority | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Establish Baseline H-Index of target zone |
| 2 | Equip **Memory-Mirror Suppressants** (Alchemical salt-smelling kits) |
| 3 | Designate "Anchor" (team member responsible for logic-checks) |
| 4 | Brief team on "Black-Flag" abort criteria (Stage 2 symptoms) |

### DURING (Exposure)

| Priority | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Limit Line-of-Sight to high-paradox anomalies (look away, use mirrors) |
| 2 | **Cadence Checks:** Anchor performs logic-check every 2 hours |
| 3 | **Hygiene:** If Stage 1 symptoms appear, rotate to rear guard; administer suppressants |
| 4 | **Abort:** If *any* member hits Stage 2, mission abort is mandatory |

### AFTER (Recovery)

| Priority | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **Silent Room:** Stage 1 personnel spend 12-24 hours in sensory deprivation (dark, quiet) |
| 2 | **Debrief:** Document exposure sources |
| 3 | **Evaluation:** Re-test logic baseline before return to duty |

### Treatment Options

| Method | Reduction | Cost / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Wilderness Rest** | -25 Stress | Requires safe camp (DC 14 Survival) |
| **Sanctuary Rest** | Full Reset | Requires safe settlement (Runic Anchor) |
| **Silent Room** | Full Reset | Dedicated facility; removes Stage 2 effects |
| **Stabilizing Draught** | -25 Stress | Consumable (Alchemical). Adds +1 Toxicity. |
| **Memory-Mirror Suppressant** | -1d10 Stress | Consumable (Combat). Emergency field use only. |
| **Spiritual Anchor** | -20 Stress | Seiðkona Ability. Costs Aether. |
| **Saga of Tranquility** | -5 Stress | Skald Ability (Party-wide). |

## IX. Factional Perspectives

### Jötun-Readers (Scriptorium): The Clinical Burden

> *"It is not madness. It is data overflow. The brain is hardware; the Blight is incompatible software. We do not mourn the corrupted hard drive; we format it if we can, and destroy it if we can't. Our duty is to document the error so we can patch the code."*
> 

**Stance:** Diagnostic. Treatable injury. Research subject.

### Iron-Banes: The Weakness of Flesh

> *"This is why the flesh fails. The machine does not go mad from seeing the truth. The machine processes until it breaks, then it stops. Humans break and keep screaming. Purify the mind with focus, or let the weakness consume you."*
> 

**Stance:** Disdain. CPS is a lack of discipline. Terminal cases are executed as "mercy."

### Common Folk: The Ruin-Curse

> *"Don't look at the lights in the bog, child. Don't listen to the wind when it sounds like voices. The Ruin takes your eyes first, then your name. If your father comes back from the wilds and doesn't know his own name... that isn't your father anymore."*
> 

**Stance:** Superstitious fear. Victims are often shunned or exiled.

### Dökkálfar (Echo-Born): The New Normal

> *"You call it sickness. We call it listening. The world is speaking a new language. You just haven't learned the grammar yet. It hurts to learn, yes. But once you stop trying to make it make sense... it's beautiful."*
> 

**Stance:** Embrace (to a degree). Some see early-stage CPS as "awakening."

---

## X. Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds and Survivors

> *"The Static Sickness. The Mind-Rot. It's the price of peeking behind the curtain of the world. The gods died, and their screams are still echoing. If you listen too close, you start screaming with them."*
> 
- **Vocabulary:** Static, Curse, Whispers, The Weight, Ruin-Madness.
- **Tone:** Fearful, warning, folk-wisdom.

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic) — Jötun-Readers

> *"Subject displays acute neuro-aetheric dissonance. Semantic drift observed in verbal reports. Diagnosis: CPS Stage 2. Administering suppressant. Recommend immediate extraction and 48-hour Silent Room protocol. Note: Subject attempted to commune with a recursive geometry hazard."*
> 
- **Vocabulary:** Dissonance, Pathology, Vector, Stage 1-4, Protocol, H-Index.
- **Tone:** Clinical, detached, precise.

### Layer 3 (Technical) — Pre-Glitch Logs

> *"WARNING: COGNITIVE FILTER FAILURE. RAW KERNEL DATA DETECTED. IMMEDIATE BUFFER OVERFLOW IMMINENT. EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN RECOMMENDED. USER SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED."*
> 
- **Vocabulary:** Kernel, Buffer Overflow, Neural Interface, Filter, Raw Data.
- **Tone:** Robotic, urgent, error-message style.

---

## XI. Change Log

| Version | Tier | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **v5.0** | A — Published | Consolidates "Static Sickness" and "Ruin-Madness" into single clinical framework. Establishes 4-stage progression model. Defines H-Index (12). Aligned with "No Magic" rule (CPS is informational, not curse). Integrated with Psychic Stress mechanics. |
