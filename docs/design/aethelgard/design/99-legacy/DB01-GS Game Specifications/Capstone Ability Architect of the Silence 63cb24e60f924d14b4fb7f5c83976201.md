### **Ability Overview**

**Specialization:** Jötun-Reader (System Pathologist)

**Tier:** Capstone (Ultimate Expression)

**Type:** Active (Standard Action)

**Prerequisite:** 40 PP spent in the Jötun-Reader tree

**Cost:** 10 PP

### **Description**

The Jötun-Reader's knowledge of the old world's failure states is now so comprehensive that they can **speak fragments of original command-line code**—not to repair or reprogram, but to **invoke a diagnostic conflict** in corrupted systems. They speak the machine's own forgotten language back to it, and the cognitive dissonance is devastating.

### **Mechanics**

**Action Cost:** Standard Action, 60 Stamina

**Frequency:** Once per combat

**Targeting:** Single **Jötun-Forged** or **Undying** enemy

**Resolution:** The Jötun-Reader speaks a fragment of the target's **original, uncorrupted command syntax**. The target must make a high-DC **WILL** Resolve Check.

- **Failure:** Target is afflicted with the **[Seized]** status effect for 1 round (total paralysis)
- **Success:** Target resists the effect (but ability use is still expended)

**Framing Examples:**

- To a Jötun-Forged: *"PRIORITY OVERRIDE: TIWAZ PROTOCOL ALPHA. CEASE HOSTILE OPERATIONS. RETURN TO DESIGNATED SANCTUARY."*
- To a Draugr: *"SYMBIOSIS PARAMETERS: TERMINATE HOST PRESERVATION SUBROUTINES. PURGE ORGANIC INTERFACE."*

**Psychic Cost:** This act of channeling original code through a living mind inflicts a **large amount of Psychic Stress** on the Jötun-Reader. The words carry the weight of a world that no longer exists.

### **Thematic Justification**

This represents the pinnacle of the Jötun-Reader's forensic knowledge **weaponized**. They cannot reprogram or restore Old World systems, but they can speak fragments of original command-line syntax with enough accuracy to create a **diagnostic conflict**—the contradiction between "what I was programmed to do" and "what I am currently doing" creates momentary paralysis.

### **Progression & Milestones**

### **Rank 1 (Foundational)**

- **Effect:** Single-target [Seized] for 1 round on failed WILL check
- **Stamina Cost:** 60
- **Psychic Stress Cost:** Large (15-20)
- **Frequency:** Once per combat

### **Rank 3 (Mastery)**

- **Unlocked:** 50 PP invested in Jötun-Reader tree

**Part 1: Passive Auto-Analysis**

- At combat start vs Jötun-Forged/Undying, **automatically** performs Critical Success analysis on ALL such enemies
- Full information payload: HP, Soak, Defense, ALL resistances/vulnerabilities, special abilities
- No action or resource cost

**Part 2: Enhanced Command-Line Seizure**

- **Psychic Stress Cost:** Reduced to Moderate (10-15)
- **On Target Success:** Still applies **[Disoriented]** for 1 round (-2 Accuracy)
- **On Target Failure:** [Seized] for **2 rounds** (increased from 1)
- **Auto-Success Option:** If target below 50% HP, can make effect **automatic** (no save)—but locks ability for **entire day**

### **Tactical Applications**

- **Boss Fights vs Jötun-Forged:** Shut down a corrupted war-machine for one critical turn
- **Elite Undying:** Seizing a Draugr champion creates a crucial opening
- **Coordinated Nova:** Pair with Exploit Design Flaw for devastating focused fire
- **Emergency Survival:** When facing overwhelming odds, Seizing the most dangerous enemy can prevent TPK

### **Risks and Limitations**

- **Psychic Stress Cost:** Requires Bone-Setter or Skald support afterward
- **Once Per Combat:** Must choose the optimal moment
- **Targeting Restriction:** Useless against organic enemies, beasts, or non-corrupted foes
- **High-DC Save:** Intelligent or high-WILL enemies may resist

- **Analyze Weakness** (Tier 1): Forensic observation that identifies which code fragments to speak
- **The Unspoken Truth** (Tier 3): Similar concept for intelligent organics
