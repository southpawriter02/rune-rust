## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Archetype** | Skirmisher |
| **Role** | Expert Navigator / Hazard Specialist / System Anomaly Hunter |
| **Path Type** | Coherent |
| **Primary Attribute** | WITS |
| **Secondary Attribute** | FINESSE |
| **Tertiary Attribute** | STURDINESS |
| **Resource System** | Stamina |
| **Trauma Economy Risk** | Medium (CPS exposure from anomaly interaction) |

The **Ruin-Stalker** is the Skirmisher specialization that has mastered the deadly art of ruin entry.

Where others see crumbling Old World facilities as death traps, the Ruin-Stalker sees **charted harvest routes**, documented anomaly patterns, and survivable extraction protocols. They are professional survivors and expert navigators. Their art is one of meticulous observation, hazard mitigation, and precision salvage.

They don't just see a crumbling wall—they see the \[Structurally Unstable\] tag. They don't just feel a draft—they feel the \[Psychic Resonance\] of nearby danger.

To choose the Ruin-Stalker is to embrace the fantasy of the ultimate dungeon delver. Your saga is written not in enemies slain, but in deadly traps bypassed, hidden passages discovered, and priceless treasures recovered from depths that would have killed anyone else. **You are the reason the party survives the ruins.**

## Core Philosophy: The Disciplined Entrant

### The Anomaly Hunter of a Corrupted World

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Preparation Defeats Danger** | Survey before advance; map before commit |
| **The Ruin as Resource** | Hazards contain value for those who know how to extract it |
| **Controlled Entry** | Timed windows, rotation cadences, CPS hygiene protocols |

In a reality where the Runic Blight has turned the ruins into treacherous, glitching labyrinths, the Ruin-Stalker is not just a scavenger; they are a **System Anomaly Hunter**. Their primary adversary is not a creature, but the decaying, toxic, and fundamentally unpredictable environment itself.

> *"The ruins are not mazes to be solved. They are corrupted systems to be analyzed. Every trap has a tell. Every anomaly has a pattern. Every hazard has a bypass. The Blight has made the Old World facilities into death traps—but death traps follow rules. And I have studied those rules for years. I don't explore ruins. I systematically dismantle their threats."*

They have developed a preternatural "danger sense" for the Blight's influence, able to spot the subtle tells of a structural instability, a paradoxical trap, or a pocket of corrupted data before it becomes a threat.

### The Coherent Path

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Source** | WITS-based perception; trained hazard recognition; methodical protocols |
| **Method** | Survey → Map → Disable → Extract |
| **Cost** | Medium (CPS exposure from anomaly interaction; salvage risks) |
| **Philosophy** | Knowledge is survival; preparation is power |

The Ruin-Stalker is a **coherent** specialization—their power comes from training, observation, and disciplined protocols, not heretical bargains. However, the nature of their work exposes them to Cognitive Paradox Syndrome (CPS) from prolonged anomaly interaction.

> *"I don't channel the Blight for power. I don't bargain with entropy. I simply understand the ruins better than anyone alive. My 'danger sense' isn't magic—it's ten thousand hours of pattern recognition. My survival isn't luck—it's protocol. The heretics trade their souls for power. I trade study for safety. And safety keeps the whole party alive."*

## Gameplay Fantasy

### Player Experience

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Fantasy** | Ultimate dungeon delver; the guide through death traps; the one who makes ruins survivable |
| **Gameplay Feel** | Survey → Map → Disable → Extract |
| **Success Metric** | Hazards bypassed; party damage prevented; treasures recovered |
| **Decision Space** | Which hazards to disable vs. bypass; when to push vs. extract; risk vs. reward on deep salvage |

Playing a Ruin-Stalker is about **methodical utility and exploration mastery**.

Your operational loop is:
1. **Survey**: Identify anomalies, hazards, and threats before the party advances
2. **Map**: Document safe routes, mark dangers, establish extraction paths
3. **Disable**: Disarm traps, veil dangerous surfaces, bypass active systems
4. **Extract**: Guide the party through with minimal exposure and maximum yield

> *"I enter the room first. Always. My Anomaly Sense sweeps the space—structural instabilities, psychic resonance zones, mechanical traps, Forlorn signatures. I mark the hazards with chalk symbols, cord the safe path, and signal the party forward. They walk where I walk. They touch what I touch. And they survive because I entered first."*

You are the party's **eyes and ears**—constantly scanning for danger and opportunity. Every trap you disarm is damage the party didn't take. Every hazard you bypass is Psychic Stress the party didn't gain.

### The Trade-Off

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Hazard detection: unparalleled | Direct combat: minimal |
| Exploration utility: essential | Open wilderness: reduced value |
| Party survival: dramatically improved | Speed: methodical, not fast |
| Salvage economy: significant wealth | Combat-heavy campaigns: less impact |

The Ruin-Stalker has **very low direct combat power**. Your value shows up in what doesn't happen: the ambush that was avoided, the trap that didn't trigger, the corruption exposure that was prevented.

> *"I don't kill enemies. I make sure the environment doesn't kill my party. The Berserkr counts their kills in corpses. I count mine in traps disarmed, hazards bypassed, and teammates who walked out of ruins that should have been their tombs. Different metrics. Same outcome: we survived."*

## Core Mechanics: The Three Pillars

### Pillar 1: Anomaly Detection & Classification

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Perceive and classify Old World anomalies before they become threats |
| **Effect** | Passive bonuses to Perception; automatic detection at high ranks |
| **Unique Feature** | Only specialization with comprehensive environmental hazard toolkit |

The Ruin-Stalker can perceive and classify Old World anomalies that would kill unprepared explorers:

| Anomaly Type | Description | Counter-Protocol |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Echo Surface** | Reflective materials that copy movement/breath | Veil with anti-pattern cloth |
| **Singing Vent** | Repeating tones that pull breath to match | Ear baffles, off-rhythm steps |
| **Animated Script** | Drifting runes responsive to gaze/sound | Cover immediately, call Rúnasmiðr |
| **Loop Corridor** | Architecture that returns in short cycles | Mark and exit; don't argue distances |
| **Frame Residue** | J.T.N. work-prints felt in the teeth | Record with air candles, return with specialists |

> *"The Echo Surface looks like a mirror, but it's not reflecting you—it's predicting you. One wrong breath and it resonates. The Singing Vent sounds like distant music, but it's trying to synchronize your breathing to its rhythm. Match it, and you suffocate. The Animated Script just looks like decorative runes—until you make eye contact and it floods your mind with data. I know every type. I know every counter. That's why I go first."*

### Pillar 2: CPS Hygiene

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Maintain cognitive coherence during prolonged ruin work |
| **Effect** | Protocols that minimize Psychic Stress and CPS progression |
| **Risk** | Ruin-Stalkers who ignore protocols become CPS casualties |

**Cognitive Paradox Syndrome** is the occupational hazard of ruin work. Ruin-Stalkers maintain strict protocols:

| Protocol | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| **Entry Windows** | 15-30 minutes maximum first entry |
| **Rotation Cadence** | Rotate lead observer every 12 minutes |
| **Abort Criteria** | Any two Stage 1 precursors (auditory paresthesia, semantic drift, looped prosody, fixation) |
| **Silent Room Protocol** | Dim • Dampen • De-pattern • Document |

> *"CPS is not a disease you catch. It's a corruption you accumulate. Every minute in a glitched facility adds weight to your mind. The symptoms are subtle at first—hearing loops, repeated phrases, inability to break gaze from certain patterns. By Stage 2, you're arguing with yourself about distances that don't make sense. By Stage 3, you're not coming back. I rotate my observation every twelve minutes. I abort at two precursors. I follow the protocols because the protocols are why I'm still sane."*

### Pillar 3: Trap Mastery

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Function** | Disarm, bypass, and deploy traps with expert precision |
| **Effect** | Superior detection range; salvage components; deploy advanced traps |
| **Unique Feature** | Can salvage materials from disarmed traps; unique trap types unavailable to others |

The Ruin-Stalker excels at both disarming enemy traps and deploying their own:

| Capability | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| **Superior Detection** | Extended range and automatic detection at high ranks |
| **Salvage Components** | Disarmed traps yield Trap Components for crafting |
| **Advanced Deployment** | Unique trap types (Impaling, Entangling, Concussive) |
| **Redirect Traps** | At high ranks, can redirect enemy traps against their creators |

> *"A trap, to me, is not an obstacle. It's a resource. Every trap I disarm yields components—springs, triggers, pressure plates. Every component I salvage goes into my own traps. By the time we reach the boss room, the corridor behind us is a death maze for any reinforcements. The facility designed traps to kill intruders. I redesign them to kill everything else."*

## Systemic Integration

### The Coherent Scout

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Primary Function** | Exploration enabler; hazard mitigation; party survival through prevention |
| **Power Source** | WITS-based perception; trained protocols; methodical discipline |
| **Unique Contribution** | Only specialization with comprehensive environmental hazard toolkit |

The Ruin-Stalker is a **coherent** specialization—their power comes from training and observation, not heretical bargains.

### Trauma Economy Interaction

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Path Type** | Coherent (Medium Trauma risk) |
| **Corruption Sources** | Precision Salvage (+3 Corruption per use on corrupted materials) |
| **Psychic Stress Sources** | CPS exposure from anomaly interaction; Navigational Bypass (+1 Stress per use) |
| **Trauma Prevention Role** | Primary function is preventing party Trauma |

The Ruin-Stalker's primary Trauma Economy function is **prevention**:

| Action | Prevention |
|--------|------------|
| Disarming traps | Prevents Physical Trauma to party |
| Bypassing \[Psychic Resonance\] zones | Prevents Psychic Stress gain |
| Detecting ambushes | Prevents surprise combat (which causes Stress) |
| Finding safe rest locations | Enables better recovery |

> *"I take small amounts of Trauma so the party doesn't take massive amounts. Every trap I disarm is broken bones the healer doesn't have to set. Every hazard I bypass is Stress the Bone-Setter doesn't have to treat. Every ambush I detect is a fight we win on our terms. My occupational risk is CPS exposure. The party's alternative is death. Fair trade."*

### Situational Power Profile

| Condition | Effectiveness |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Optimal** | Dense trap-filled ruins; Old World facilities; anomaly-rich zones; exploration-heavy campaigns |
| **Standard** | Mixed environments with some hazards |
| **Suboptimal** | Open wilderness; combat-heavy campaigns; anomaly-free zones; "speed run" playstyles |

### Party Synergies

| Ally | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Jötun-Reader** | Your survey + their translation = full site comprehension |
| **Bone-Setter** | CPS management and coherence medicine |
| **Rúnasmiðr** | You find the inscriptions; they contain or extract them |
| **Skjaldmær / Atgeir-wielder** | Hold thresholds while you complete surveys |
| **Crafters (Scrap-Tinker)** | Your salvage feeds their crafting economy |

**Negative Synergies:**

| Ally | Issue |
|------|-------|
| **Aggressive parties** | May not respect your survey cadence |
| **Impatient playstyles** | Your value is in preparation, not speed |

> *"The Jötun-Reader translates the inscriptions I find. The Rúnasmiðr contains the dangerous runes I identify. The Bone-Setter treats the CPS symptoms I can't avoid. The Skjaldmær holds the door while I complete my survey. We're a machine. I'm the eyes. They're the hands. Together, we strip ruins that would kill any other party."*

### Positional Considerations

| Position | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Point (Front)** | Optimal; first to detect hazards; guides party movement |
| **Mid Row** | Acceptable; can support survey from safe position |
| **Back Row** | Suboptimal; hazard detection works best from the front |

---

## Lore Integration

### The Entry Rite

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Philosophy** | Preparation defeats danger; knowledge is survival |
| **Training** | Years studying anomaly patterns, trap mechanisms, and CPS hygiene |
| **Function** | Make the unsurvivable survivable; extract wealth from death traps |
| **Status** | Essential for any serious salvage crew; respected for their quiet competence |

The Ruin-Stalker represents the philosophy that **the world's corpse can be harvested safely**—if you have the right training, the right protocols, and the right patience.

> *"The Old World left behind treasures beyond imagining—and traps to protect them. The Ginnungagap Glitch corrupted everything, turning even the safest facilities into death mazes. Most scavengers die on their first run. I've been running for fifteen years. The difference isn't luck. The difference is discipline. Survey before you enter. Map before you commit. Disable before you advance. Extract before you overstay. Simple rules. Perfect execution. That's the Entry Rite."*

### The Anomaly Hunter's Tools

| Tool | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Survey Kit** | Mapping components, chalk markers, cord lines |
| **Anomaly Detection Gear** | Veil cloth, ear baffles, air candles |
| **Trap Components** | Springs, triggers, pressure plates for crafting |
| **CPS Hygiene Kit** | De-patterning materials, Silent Room protocols |

The Ruin-Stalker's power is not magic—it is **training and equipment**. Their tools are practical, their methods are reproducible, and their protocols can be taught.

> *"My kit weighs thirty pounds. Veil cloth for Echo Surfaces. Ear baffles for Singing Vents. Air candles for Frame Residue detection. Chalk and cord for marking safe paths. Trap components for deployment. CPS hygiene supplies for mental coherence. Every item has been field-tested in a hundred facilities. Every protocol has been written in the blood of Stalkers who didn't follow it. The kit is the doctrine. The doctrine is survival."*

### Factional Perspectives

| Faction | View |
|---------|------|
| **Salvage Crews** | Essential; "we don't run without a Stalker" |
| **Jötun-Readers** | Respected colleagues; different expertise, shared goals |
| **Iron-Banes** | Valued support; Stalkers find the targets, Banes destroy them |
| **General Population** | Respected; "the ones who come back from places that kill everyone else" |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the Age of Echoes, when the Old World's carcass has become a labyrinth of death traps and reality glitches, the Ruin-Stalker is the disciplined entrant who makes the unsurvivable survivable. They are not heroes who charge into danger—they are professionals who map it, document it, and systematically dismantle it. Their danger sense perceives what kills others: the subtle displacement of air from a pressure plate, the faint hum of active systems behind a wall, the almost-imperceptible flicker of unstable geometry. They see the \[Structurally Unstable\] tag where others see only a crumbling wall. They feel the \[Psychic Resonance\] of nearby Forlorn where others feel only a draft. Their saga is written not in enemies slain, but in deadly traps bypassed, hidden passages discovered, and teammates who survived because the Stalker entered first. They are the ghost of the ruins, one with the decaying world, seeing what the ruins were, what they've become, and every path through their madness. Where others flee anomalies, the Ruin-Stalker documents, catalogs, and converts danger into knowledge. They are the reason salvage crews come back. They are the reason the party survives."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Ruin-Stalker (System Anomaly Hunter) represents the Skirmisher specialization optimized for environmental hazard mitigation, anomaly detection, and exploration enablement. Mechanical role: utility specialist and party survival enabler. Core mechanics: Anomaly Detection (passive WITS bonuses to perceive environmental hazards), CPS Hygiene (protocols to minimize Psychic Stress and CPS progression), and Trap Mastery (disarm, bypass, and deploy traps). Key differentiator: only specialization with comprehensive environmental hazard toolkit; automatic trap/hazard detection at capstone; unique anomaly exploitation abilities. Signature ability: Ghost of the Ruins (automatic success on Minor/Moderate hazards; comprehensive survey revealing all dangers and treasures; Stabilize the Code suppresses hazards for 3 rounds). Trauma Economy integration: Medium risk; coherent path with CPS exposure from anomaly work; primary function is preventing party Trauma through hazard mitigation. Social function: essential salvage crew member who makes dangerous facilities survivable. Optimal deployment: trap-filled ruins; Old World facilities; anomaly-dense zones; exploration-heavy campaigns."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"SPECIALIZATION: Ruin-Stalker (System Anomaly Hunter). ARCHETYPE: Skirmisher. PATH TYPE: Coherent. ROLE: Expert Navigator / Hazard Specialist / System Anomaly Hunter. PRIMARY STAT: WITS. SECONDARY STAT: FINESSE. TERTIARY STAT: STURDINESS. RESOURCE: Stamina. CORE MECHANICS: Anomaly Detection (passive WITS bonuses), CPS Hygiene (entry windows, rotation cadence, abort criteria), Trap Mastery (disarm, salvage, deploy). TIER STRUCTURE: T1 (Foundational Survey): Anomaly Sense I (passive, +1d10-3d10 hazard detection), Careful Advance (15 Stamina, safe movement + party bonus), Disarm Mechanism (20 Stamina, trap neutralization + salvage).

## Summary

The Ruin-Stalker is the **system anomaly hunter**.

They are disciplined professionals who have mastered the deadly art of ruin entry—surveying facilities before the party advances, mapping safe routes through death traps, disabling hazards that would kill others, and extracting maximum value from environments that should be unsurvivable.

Their gameplay is methodical and tense: enter first, detect hazards, mark safe paths, guide the party through, and extract before CPS accumulates. They have minimal direct combat power, but their value to party survival is immeasurable—every trap disarmed is damage prevented, every hazard bypassed is Stress avoided, every ambush detected is a fight won on favorable terms.

This creates a unique niche: the **coherent exploration enabler** who proves that preparation defeats danger. Where others flee anomalies and avoid ruins, the Ruin-Stalker documents, catalogs, and converts danger into knowledge.

The capstone Ghost of the Ruins represents the ultimate expression of this philosophy—the moment when the Ruin-Stalker becomes one with the decaying world, seeing every trap, every hazard, every secret passage the moment they cross the threshold. The ruins confess their secrets to those who enter with discipline.

This is not magic. This is mastery.
Survey before you enter. Map before you commit.
Disable before you advance. Extract before you overstay.

*The ruins have no secrets from me anymore.
I see what they were. I see what they've become.
And I see every path through their madness.*
