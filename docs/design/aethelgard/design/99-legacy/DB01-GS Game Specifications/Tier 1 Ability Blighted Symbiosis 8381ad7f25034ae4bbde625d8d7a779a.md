## Core Identity

**Blighted Symbiosis** represents your heretical adaptation to the Runic Blight's physical corruption. Your body has undergone fundamental changes—poisons no longer harm you, they sustain you. Where others flee toxic mires and blighted swamps, you thrive.

## Mechanics

### Always Active (Passive)

**Immunity:** You are immune to [Poisoned] and [Disease] status effects.

**Environmental Mastery:**

- Can rest safely in [Metaphysical Corruption] zones
- Toxic environmental hazards restore **5 HP per turn** instead of damaging
- **Wasteland Survival +2:** Automatic bonus (swamp/ruin specialist)

### The Price (Trauma Economy)

<aside>
⚠️

**Corruption Accumulation:**

- When you resist a Poison/Disease effect: Gain **+1 Runic Blight Corruption**
- When you rest in a [Corrupted] biome: Gain **+2 Corruption** per rest
- Your body constantly filters the world's decay, fueling your power at the cost of your soul
</aside>

### Rank Progression

| Rank | PP Cost | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | Base effects (immunity + 5 HP/turn from hazards) |
| 2 | 20 | Hazard healing → **8 HP/turn**; +3 Wasteland Survival |
| 3 | 35 | Hazard healing → **12 HP/turn**; immune to [Corroded]; Corruption gain reduced by 1 |

## Tactical Applications

**Toxic Zone Dominance:**

```jsx
Party enters toxic swamp (10 damage/turn)
Others: 10 damage/turn, must leave
Myr-Stalker: +5 HP/turn, can stay indefinitely

Result: Fight in zones that harm enemies but heal you
```

**Synergies:**

- **Corruption Catalyst:** Your Corruption fuels poison damage
- **One with the Rot:** Converts poison resistance into healing
- **Pandemic Bloom:** Ultimate expression of this symbiosis

## Failure Modes

<aside>
⚠️

**Corruption Accumulation** — Each poison resisted = +1 Corruption. In toxic zones, you're constantly accumulating. Must balance power with soul cost.

<aside>
⚠️

**Non-Toxic Environments** — In clean zones, this passive provides no benefit. Your power is situational.
