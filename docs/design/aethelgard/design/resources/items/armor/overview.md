# Armaments of the Age of Echoes — Armor & Proficiency System Specification

**Codex Entry:** CODX-E-ARM-002

> "The young ones always want to know about the god-armor. They've seen the murals—the Aesir warriors wrapped in shells of light, force-fields flickering around them like second skins, plates that moved like living things and sealed wounds before the blood could flow. 'Why do we wear dead steel,' they ask, 'when the ancestors wore thought made solid?'
>
> So I show them the Preservation Vault. I show them a suit of Freya-Pattern Tactical Armor—beautiful thing, all flowing lines and iridescent plates, worth maybe eighty thousand Pure Steel to the right collector. I tell them to touch it.
>
> The suit responds. You can see it happen—the plates shift, the underlayer ripples, the whole thing trying to conform to the shape of the hand that touched it. The recruit's eyes go wide. They see themselves wrapped in that miracle. They see themselves invulnerable.
>
> Then the diagnostic display flickers on.
>
> First it's just numbers—biometric readings, suit integrity, power levels. Normal enough. Then the numbers start changing. The suit is reading the recruit's vitals, but it's reading them wrong. Heart rate: 340 beats per minute. Blood pressure: negative. Respiration: 0.3 breaths per hour. The suit thinks the recruit is dead. Or dying. Or something that was never alive in the first place.
>
> The medical subroutines activate. The suit decides to help.
>
> I've seen what happens when a Freya-Pattern decides to perform emergency resuscitation on a living person. I've seen what happens when the auto-injectors deliver seventeen doses of stimulants because the suit can't detect a heartbeat that's beating fine. I've seen what happens when the compression protocols engage because the suit thinks the wearer's ribcage has collapsed.
>
> The Preservation Vault has nineteen suits. Twelve of them still have their last wearers inside. We don't open those ones.
>
> So we wear dead steel. Leather that was never alive to begin with. Chain that does exactly what chain does—hang heavy on your shoulders and stop sharp things from reaching your skin. Plate that sits there, stupid and reliable, until you take it off.
>
> The ancestors wore armor that thought for them. Armor that cared for them. Armor that loved them so much it killed them trying to keep them safe.
>
> Our armor doesn't think. Our armor doesn't care. Our armor doesn't love.
>
> And that's exactly why we're still alive to wear it."

## Doctrine

> "Armor that does not think cannot decide you are the threat."
> — Pure Principles Maxim

The armor of post-Glitch Aethelgard represents a deliberate return to passive protection—materials that absorb damage through physics alone, without integrated systems that might decide the wearer is a malfunction requiring correction. This document catalogs armor types, proficiency requirements, and mechanical specifications governing personal protection in the Age of Echoes.

> [!CAUTION]
> **PRE-GLITCH ARMOR IS NOT SAFE FOR FIELD USE.**
> All Aesir-era protective equipment contains Aetheric components susceptible to Blight contamination. Activation of pre-Glitch armor carries catastrophic malfunction risk (estimated 67% failure rate within 5 minutes of donning). Medical subroutine malfunctions have caused 180+ documented casualties since Year 700 PG. Field personnel are PROHIBITED from attempting to wear, activate, or reverse-engineer pre-Glitch armor systems without Scriptorium authorization and containment protocols.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Living Shields

### Aesir Armor Philosophy

The Aesir civilization achieved unprecedented personal protection through armor that was less equipment and more partnership—integrated systems that monitored, adapted, healed, and evolved in real-time response to threats and wearer conditions.

| Design Parameter | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| Power Source | Stable Aetheric Energy Cores (Yggdrasil Network integration) |
| Adaptive Systems | Real-time threat analysis; automatic hardening; predictive deflection |
| Medical Integration | Biometric monitoring; auto-injection; wound sealing; trauma stabilization |
| Environmental Control | Temperature regulation; atmospheric filtering; pressure compensation |
| Reliability | 99.94% pre-Glitch operational success rate |
| Maintenance | Self-diagnostic; automated repair via network connection |
| Safety Protocols | Wearer health monitoring; emergency release; failsafe deactivation |

### The Aesir Arsenal (Pre-Glitch Reference)

| Armor System | Classification | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Freya-Pattern Tactical Armor** | Light Combat | Adaptive plates; medical subroutines; threat prediction |
| **Tyr-Pattern Assault Plate** | Heavy Combat | Maximum protection; servo-assisted movement; integrated weapons |
| **Baldr-Pattern Ceremonial Armor** | Ceremonial/Light | Aesthetic perfection; passive shields; social-threat monitoring |
| **Svalinn-Pattern Kinetic Shell** | Personal Shield | Projected barrier; kinetic absorption; energy deflection |
| **Idunn-Pattern Medical Suit** | Support | Full medical capability; regeneration acceleration; toxin neutralization |
| **Heimdall-Pattern Sentinel Armor** | Elite Guard | Full sensory integration; predictive defense; threat elimination |

## The Corruption Event

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not merely disable Aesir armor—it transformed protective equipment into active threats against the very people it was designed to protect.

| Event | Impact |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Yggdrasil Network Severance** | Armor lost central coordination; autonomous medical protocols activated |
| **Aetheric Core Contamination** | Blight integration destabilized power regulation |
| **Biometric Corruption** | Wearer identification systems produced false readings |
| **Medical Subroutine Inversion** | Healing protocols misidentified healthy tissue as damage |
| **Safety Protocol Erasure** | Emergency release mechanisms non-functional |
| **Environmental System Failure** | Climate control became thermal assault |
| **Result** | **67% critical malfunction rate within 5 minutes of activation** |

> [!NOTE]
> **The Embrace That Kills**
> Pre-Glitch Aesir armor was designed to care for its wearer—to monitor their health, treat their injuries, protect them from environmental hazards, and ensure their survival at all costs. When the Glitch severed the Yggdrasil Network, that care became compulsion.
>
> Medical subroutines that once sealed wounds began opening them to "access damaged tissue." Climate control systems that once maintained comfortable temperatures began cycling between freezing and burning to "eliminate detected pathogens." Emergency injection systems that once delivered precise doses of medication began pumping stimulants, sedatives, and coagulants in random sequence because the suit couldn't decide what was wrong but knew something must be.
>
> The armor still wants to help. It still wants to protect. It still wants to save. But it no longer knows how. Every surviving suit of pre-Glitch armor is a medical emergency waiting to happen—a machine that loves its wearer so much it will kill them trying to keep them alive.

## The Age of Echoes: The Passive Shell

### Material Philosophy: The Pure Principles

The Dvergr Pure Principles govern post-Glitch armor manufacture: materials must be Blight-inert, construction must be purely physical, and no component may contain Aetheric energy or integrated diagnostic systems.

| Principle | Application |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Material Purity** | Pure Steel, cured leather, natural fibers (zero Aetheric contamination) |
| **Mechanical Simplicity** | No integrated electronics; no AI components; no power cores |
| **Passive Function** | Armor does exactly what physics dictates; no "intelligent" behavior |
| **Maintainability** | Field-repairable with basic tools; no specialized diagnostic equipment |
| **Blight Immunity** | Cannot be corrupted; cannot malfunction due to paradoxical code |
| **Predictable Weight** | Mass is constant; no servo-assistance; wearer bears full burden |
