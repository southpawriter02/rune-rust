## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Basic Concoction is the Einbúi's **foundational field crafting and support tool**—the survivor's remedy. They lack sophisticated knowledge, but can create crude-but-effective healing or energy restoration from common materials.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Flexible in-combat HP or Stamina restoration
- **Secondary:** Off-healer capability for non-healer parties
- **Resource Loop:** Connects foraging success to combat effectiveness
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The resourceful survivor who makes do with nothing

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Moderate (lower potency than specialists)
- **Versatility:** Choice makes it adaptable to any situation
- **Component Cost:** Requires foraged materials

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Einbúi crushes a few common herbs in their palm, mixing them with cloth and water. This is not the refined work of a Bone-Setter—it is the **desperate, practical medicine of a survivor** who has mended their own wounds a hundred times with nothing but what the wastes provide.

*"Hold still. This won't be pleasant, but it'll keep you moving."*

### Thematic Resonance

Basic Concoction transforms foraging skill into direct party support—proof that preparation matters.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Activation

- **Action Type:** Standard Action
- **Cost:** 35 Stamina + 1 [Common Herb] + 1 [Clean Cloth]
- **Range:** Melee
- **Target:** Single ally or self

### Choice Mechanic

| Option | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Crude Poultice** | Restore small flat HP (e.g., 20 HP) |
| **Weak Stimulant** | Restore small flat Stamina (e.g., 25 STA) |

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Resource Validation:** Confirm Stamina and components available
2. **Choice Prompt:** Poultice or Stimulant?
3. **Cost Payment:** Deduct Stamina and consume components
4. **Effect Application:** Apply chosen restoration to target

---

## IV. Progression Path

### Rank 1 (Base — This Ability)

- Crude Poultice: 20 HP / Weak Stimulant: 25 STA

### Rank 2 (Expert — 20 PP)

- Potency increased by 50% (30 HP / 37 STA)

### Rank 3 (Mastery — Capstone via Master Improviser)

- Doubled potency (40 HP / 50 STA)
- **New:** Poultice also cleanses 1 stack of [Poisoned]
- **New:** Stimulant also cleanses [Staggered]

---

## V. Tactical Applications

1. **Emergency Healing:** Patch allies when healer is down/busy
2. **Stamina Support:** Enable Stamina-hungry allies (Berserkr, Strandhögg)
3. **Adaptability:** Choose based on immediate battle needs
4. **Resource Efficiency:** Common components are easy to forage

---

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Berserkr:** Stamina restoration fuels Fury generation
- **Radical Self-Reliance I:** Foraging provides components
- **No-healer parties:** Fills critical support gap

### Negative Synergies

- **Component scarcity:** Useless without materials
- **Dedicated healers:** Outclassed by specialists
