## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Ability Type** | Active — Non-Combat (10 minutes) |
| **Tier** | 1 (Foundational) |
| **PP Cost** | 3 / 3 / 3 |
| **Resource Cost** | 10 Stamina + Reagent Components |

## Thematic Description

> *"The bench is where battles are won. You measure reagents, seal cartridges, and check O-rings with practiced efficiency."*
> 

Field Preparation is the **foundation of Alka-hestur power**. Without prepared payloads, you're just a fighter with a fancy lance. This ability transforms downtime into combat readiness, converting raw alchemical components into tactical solutions.

## Reagent Components

| Payload Type | Primary Component | Secondary Component |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Ignition** | Sulfur extract | Binding agent |
| **Cryo** | Frost salts | Binding agent |
| **EMP** | Charged crystals | Conductive fluid |
| **Acidic** | Corrosive extract | Stabilizer |
| **Concussive** | Impact powder | Binding agent |
| **Smoke** | Smoke powder | Dispersant |
| **Marking** | Tracking dye | Adhesive base |

## Preparation Protocol

### Standard Session

1. Set up portable bench/workspace
2. Inventory available reagents
3. Select payload types based on expected encounters
4. Measure, mix, seal cartridges
5. Load into rack for carry

### Rank 3: Short Rest Preparation

- Can prepare **during any short rest**
- No dedicated preparation time needed
- Enables mid-expedition resupply

---

## Synergies

### Internal (Alka-hestur Tree)

- **Payload Strike**: Consumes prepared payloads
- **Rack Expansion**: More capacity for prepared payloads
- **Area Saturation**: Requires 3 payloads per use
- **Volatile Synthesis**: Emergency alternative when preparation isn't possible

### External (Party Composition)

- **Foragers/Scavengers**: Supply reagent components
- **Downtime-heavy campaigns**: Maximize preparation opportunities
- **Long expeditions**: Rank 3 short rest prep crucial

---

## Tactical Applications

### Pre-Mission Loadout

Based on expected encounters, prepare balanced rack:

- 1-2 Ignition (general organic)
- 1-2 EMP (mechanical)
- 1 Acidic (armored)
- 1 Smoke (utility)

### Bonus Payload (Rank 3)

20% chance per session = roughly 1 free payload per 5 sessions. Over long campaigns, significant resource savings.

## v5.0 Compliance Notes

✅ **Technology, Not Magic**: Chemistry and preparation, not spellcasting

✅ **Resource Management**: Component requirements create meaningful choices

✅ **Preparation Philosophy**: Core Alka-hestur identity

✅ **Layer 2 Voice**: Laboratory and synthesis terminology
