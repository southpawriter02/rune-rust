## Thematic Description

> *"More solutions means more answers. Your bandolier grows heavier, but so does your versatility."*
> 

Rack Expansion increases your **payload carrying capacity**, allowing you to bring more solutions to the field. More slots means more options, more redundancy, and more sustained combat effectiveness.

---

## Mechanical Implementation

### Base Effect (Rank 1)

- Increase payload carrying capacity by **+2** (total: 6 base)
- Can carry **2 of the same payload type** (previously limited to 1 each)

### Rank 2

- Capacity **+4** (total: 8)
- Can carry **3 of same type**
- **PP Cost**: 4

### Rank 3

- Capacity **+6** (total: 10)
- **Quick-Swap**: Can swap loaded payload as **Bonus Action** once per turn
- **PP Cost**: 4

---

## Capacity Progression

| Investment | Capacity | Same-Type Limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base (no ability) | 4 | 1 each |
| Rank 1 | 6 | 2 each |
| Rank 2 | 8 | 3 each |
| Rank 3 | 10 | 3 each + Quick-Swap |

---

## Quick-Swap (Rank 3)

**Trigger**: Bonus Action (once per turn)

**Effect**: Change which payload is "loaded" for your next Payload Strike without consuming an action.

**Tactical Value**:

- React to unexpected enemy types mid-combat
- Switch from damage to utility (Smoke) instantly
- Adapt to changing battlefield conditions

---

## Synergies

### Internal (Alka-hestur Tree)

- **Payload Strike**: More payloads = more strikes per expedition
- **Field Preparation**: Prepare more payloads to fill expanded rack
- **Area Saturation**: Requires 3 same-type payloads—Rack Expansion enables this
- **Cocktail Mixing**: More capacity allows carrying both singles and cocktail components

### External (Party Composition)

- **Long expeditions**: Extended operations without resupply
- **Varied encounters**: Prepare for multiple enemy types

---

## Tactical Applications

### Loadout Examples

**Rank 1 (6 slots)**:

- 2× Ignition, 2× EMP, 1× Acidic, 1× Smoke

**Rank 2 (8 slots)**:

- 3× Ignition, 2× EMP, 2× Acidic, 1× Smoke

**Rank 3 (10 slots)**:

- 3× Ignition, 3× EMP, 2× Acidic, 1× Cryo, 1× Smoke
