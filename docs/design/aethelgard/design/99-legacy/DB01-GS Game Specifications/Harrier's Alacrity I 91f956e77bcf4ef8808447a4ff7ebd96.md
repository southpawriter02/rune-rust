## Thematic Description

> *"Lives coiled for motion; begins each clash already in stride and sees first openings sooner."*
> 

Harrier's Alacrity represents the Strandhögg's **combat readiness**. You enter every engagement already moving, already building momentum. While others are still processing the threat, you're already in position.

- **Reaver's Strike**: Immediate Pace generation from turn 1
- **Dread Charge**: Engage + disorient before enemies act
- **Tidal Rush**: Passive Pace from ally debuffs

### External (Party Composition)

- **Controllers**: Early CC while you're already positioned
- **Skald**: Tempo buffs stack with Initiative bonus
- **Ambush setups**: You act first, set the tone

## Tactical Applications

### The Alpha Strike

1. Combat begins: 15/25/35 Pace already loaded
2. High Initiative: Act before enemies
3. R3 advantage: First attack nearly guaranteed hit
4. Dread Charge opener: Engage + [Disoriented]
5. Momentum established before enemy turn 1

### Pace Economy

- R1: 15 starting = 1-2 abilities short of Savage Harvest
- R2: 25 starting = Harrier's Whirlwind available turn 1
- R3: 35 starting = Almost at Riptide threshold with one good turn
