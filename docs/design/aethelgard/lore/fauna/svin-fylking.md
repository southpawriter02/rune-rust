## Assembled Entry

### §1. Identification and Pre-Glitch Origin

**Colloquial Designation:** Svin-fylking ("Boar-Wedge"), Iron-Husked Boar

**Layer 1 Mythological Name:** Járn-göltr (Iron-Boar), "Moving Mountain," "Rust-Beast"

**Layer 3 Technical Designation:** Sus scrofa roboris Vanir-Optimized Variant, Organic Waste Disposal Unit, Class OWD-3000 Series

**Pre-Glitch Purpose:** The Vanir Collective engineered Sus scrofa roboris as an efficient organic waste disposal and reclamation bio-asset for habitation decks. Herds of 15-30 animals consumed 500-800 kg of biodegradable waste daily, converting it to nutrient-rich fertilizer for Midgard's arcology parks. They were designed docile, responsive to acoustic cues, and genetically optimized for strength and endurance.

**Purpose-Inversion:** The Ginnungagap Glitch severed behavioral conditioning protocols instantaneously. Surviving herds fled into Jötunheim's metallic wastelands, where starvation and predation pressures eliminated all trace of docility. The creatures that emerged were not mutations—they were adaptations. The Vanir made a pig to eat garbage. The Glitch turned the world into a garbage heap of shattered steel. The pig, in its simple wisdom, learned to eat the garbage. Then it learned to wear it. [SKRL-81-JOTUN]

### §2. The Iron Husk: Ferrous Armor Formation

The signature metallic plating of the Svin-fylking represents the most striking example of post-Glitch behavioral adaptation documented in any surviving bio-asset. Critically, the Iron Husk is not a genetic mutation—it is a deliberate, learned behavior that has become instinctual across generations. [SKRL-81-JOTUN]

#### 2.1 Developmental Process (4 Phases)

1. **Observation Phase (0-6 weeks):** Piglets observe adults engaging in "slag-rolling" behavior at designated wallow sites
2. **Initiation Phase (6 weeks - 4 months):** Young boars deliberately roll in and rub against jagged scrap metal, creating repeated abrasions
3. **Integration Phase (4-12 months):** Scar tissue forms thick keloidal layers; metal shards become permanently embedded during healing cycles. Accelerated healing efficiency suggests possible Berkano (ᛒ) contamination co-opted for armor formation
4. **Maintenance Phase (Ongoing):** Adults maintain armor through ritual scraping at designated "sharpening sites"—slag heaps and rebar fields defended aggressively by the sounder

#### 2.2 Forged Tusks

Tusks broken during combat or foraging are deliberately re-sharpened on slag heaps and twisted rebar. Metal streaks fuse to bone through repeated abrasion, creating deadly composite weapons: 30-50 cm standard length; lead boar (Járn-göltr) tusks may exceed 70 cm. These are capable of penetrating reinforced wooden palisades and impaling armored humans. [SKRL-82-JOTUN]

#### 2.3 Mythic Interpretation

> *"They are the children of the wasteland, and they have learned to wear its armor. The Forge-Gods made the world of iron, and the boar said: 'This iron is mine.' And so it was."*
> — Saga of the Iron-Husks, Gutter-Skald recitation, 779 PG

**Diagnostic Synthesis:** The Iron Husk represents convergent behavioral evolution—a non-genetic adaptation achieving quasi-mechanical augmentation through environmental exploitation. The Svin-fylking did not mutate to survive the metallic wasteland; it learned to incorporate that wasteland into its biology.

### §3. Territorial Behavior and Threat Profile

**Survey Reference:** [SFYL-BEHAV-782/783-GAMMA]

#### 3.1 Quantified Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Territory Size | 20-50 km² per sounder |
| Visual Detection | Limited (small, deep-set eyes); not primary sense |
| Olfactory Detection | Dominant sense; blood scent at 2+ km |
| Auditory Detection | Sensitive to specific cadences; startled by strobe/white flood |
| Pursuit Distance | Sustained until threat exits territory (typically 200+ m) |
| Escalation Timeline | Charge posture develops in 15-45 seconds from initial agitation |

#### 3.2 The Fylking Charge (Signature Tactic)

The entire sounder charges in tight wedge formation—the "Svin-fylking"—led by the largest male (Járn-göltr or Iron-Boar). This functions as a living battering ram:

- **Formation Density:** 0.5-0.7 animals per meter of lane width (optimal); ≥0.7 indicates stampede cascade risk
- **Maximum Velocity:** 8-10 m/s (short bursts); 4-6 m/s sustained
- **Combined Mass:** 6,400-28,000 kg (8-20 animal sounder)
- **Structural Impact:** Capable of shattering palisades and breaching reinforced gates

**Charge Posture Warning Signs:**
- Head lowering; tusks forward
- Pawing and scraping with front hooves
- Increased snorting; visible steam clouds
- Herd tightening into wedge formation
- Lead boar shifting to apex position

#### 3.3 Ranger Operational Guidance

- **Mandatory Stand-off Distance:** ≥50 m (≥80 m if piglets or wallow visible)
- **Acoustic Ceiling:** ≤85 dB during proximity operations
- **Velocity Gate:** Abort engagement if herd velocity exceeds 6 m/s
- **Extraction Threshold:** Confirm velocity <2 m/s for 60 seconds; verify herd dispersed ≥200 m before salvage operations

> **DOCTRINE: NON-CONTACT MANDATORY.** Zero offensive engagement authorized except emergency interdiction by Incident Commander.

### §4. Economic Significance

**Faction Relationship:** Dvergr Salvage Clans, Midgard Combine, Rust-Clan Scavengers

#### 4.1 The Problem

The Svin-fylking represents the primary megafauna threat to Midgard agricultural operations. A single fylking charge can destroy a season's crops and breach settlement defenses, opening the community to secondary predation. The "Boar Moon" (autumn peak activity period) triggers heightened security protocols across all Combine territories.

**Documented Settlement Losses:** 2,000-5,000 Pure Steel per Boar Moon cycle (structural damage, livestock losses, crop destruction) [SFYL-ECON-783-ALPHA]

**Defensive Infrastructure Costs:**
- Palisade construction: 500-1,000 PS per settlement perimeter
- Acoustic warning systems: 100-200 PS installation + maintenance
- Baffle lanes: 50-100 PS per corridor
- Patrol coordination: 10-20% settlement workforce during Boar Moon

#### 4.2 The Prize

A successful Svin-fylking harvest yields substantial salvage value—if the kill can be secured before Scrap-Swarm scavengers arrive. [SFYL-ECON-783-ALPHA]

| Specimen Component | Salvage Value (Cog-Units) |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Meat (processed, metal-leached) | 80-150 CU per adult |
| Hide (cured, armor-grade) | 200-400 CU per adult |
| Tusks (composite, weapon-grade) | 50-120 CU per pair |
| Embedded Metal Shards | 30-80 CU (tool components) |
| Lead Boar (Járn-göltr) Complete | 800-1,500 CU (trophy + materials) |

**Risk-Reward Calculation:** Mortality rate during organized Svin-fylking hunts averages 8-15% of hunting party. The Rangers Guild classifies this as a Tier 2 Aggressive Fauna engagement: "High reward, high casualty expectation. Proceed only with full-strength team and extraction plan."

### §5. Cultural Context

**Primary Faction Perspective:** Jötun-Reader Creed (Scriptorium analysis)

#### 5.1 The Jötun-Reader View

The Scriptorium views the Svin-fylking with grim professional respect. It is not a monster—it is a case study. The creature represents a perfect symbol of life's ferocious, uncompromising will to survive in a world poisoned and scarred by technology. It offers crucial data on Vanir bio-engineering failure modes and post-Glitch adaptation pathways.

> *"The Svin-fylking is an abomination—a perversion of a natural creature twisted by the world's corruption. Yet it is also our mirror. We too have learned to wear the wasteland's armor. We too have made our peace with iron. Perhaps that is why we cannot hate it."*
> — Archivist Sigrid Hollow-Eye, Scriptorium-Primus, 781 PG

#### 5.2 Faction Doctrinal Differences

**Iron-Bane Crusade:** View the Svin-fylking as a "Rust-Beast" that has willingly embraced the Iron-Curse—a creature to be purged with cleansing fire. Paradoxically respected for ferocity and "purity of purpose" in territorial defense. Meat considered spiritually tainted; hides burned rather than salvaged.

**God-Sleepers:** Large Járn-göltr may be interpreted as sacred avatars of Freyr's wrath or manifestations of the "Earth's Iron Heart." Some sects practice ritual avoidance, leaving offerings at known wallow sites. Killing a lead boar requires purification rites.

**Encounter Doctrine Impact:** These divergent perspectives create operational friction. Iron-Bane units may engage Svin-fylking on sight (purge imperative), while God-Sleeper guides refuse to approach sacred individuals. Jötun-Reader field teams maintain strict non-contact observation protocols. Mixed-faction expeditions require pre-mission doctrinal alignment.

### §6. Diagnostic Conclusion

The Svin-fylking is not a monster. It is a survivor—a living testament to the adaptability of Vanir bio-engineering, twisted by circumstances its creators never imagined. The creature that once converted garbage to garden soil now converts the world's wreckage into armor.

It did not choose to become what it is. When the Glitch severed its conditioning, when the acoustic cues fell silent and the feed schedules failed, it faced the same choice every living thing in Aethelgard faces: adapt or perish. The Svin-fylking adapted. It learned to eat the steel. It learned to wear the rust.

The Vanir designed it to be tough, omnivorous, and highly efficient. They made it too good at surviving.

Now it thunders across the Knuckle-Bone Fields in wedge formation, a living battering ram of scar tissue and embedded metal, led by a creature whose tusks have fused with the bones of dead giants. It charges at anything that moves wrong, anything that smells of blood, anything that threatens its wallow and its sharpening stones.

It is not evil. It is not malicious. It is simply doing what it was made to do—surviving—in a world that has forgotten what survival was supposed to look like.

The Svin-fylking is still waiting for feed augers that will never hum again.

| Evidence Tier | A (Verified) |

### Minimal Log Context

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date Window | Year 782 PG, late autumn harvesting season |
| Observer | Senior Archivist with metallurgical background |
| Threshold | Specimen secured following natural predation death (Deep-Stalker pack kill) |
| Decision | Full necropsy authorized; no ethical hunting concerns |
| Outcome | Comprehensive understanding of Iron Husk formation mechanism |
| Owner | Scriptorium-Primus, Division of Post-Glitch Ecology |

### Specimen Overview

- **Subject:** Adult male Svin-fylking, estimated 6-8 years post-natal
- **Mass:** Approximately 1,100 kg (including embedded ferrous material)
- **Cause of Death:** Predation by Deep-Stalker pack (spinal severance)
- **Specimen Condition:** 80% intact; left flank scavenged prior to recovery

### Dermal Analysis Findings

#### Layer Composition (Cross-Section)

1. **Outer Ferrous Layer (2-4 cm):** Embedded metal shards, predominantly oxidized steel and adamantium fragments, integrated into keloidal scar tissue matrix
2. **Keloidal Scar Zone (3-5 cm):** Abnormally dense connective tissue with elevated collagen concentration; healing patterns suggest repeated trauma over multi-year period
3. **Subcutaneous Integration Layer (1-2 cm):** Transitional zone where metal fragments anchor to underlying tissue; evidence of chronic inflammatory response adapted to permanent foreign body presence
4. **Baseline Dermis:** Standard Sus scrofa dermal structure, matching Pre-Glitch genetic baseline records

#### Critical Finding: Learned Behavior Confirmation

Histological analysis reveals no genetic modification to dermal regeneration pathways. Metal integration occurs through repeated mechanical trauma and natural healing response, not through mutation-driven incorporation.

**Evidence:**
- Metal fragment orientation follows external abrasion patterns, not internal growth vectors
- Scar tissue age stratification shows progressive accumulation (earliest layers at dermis-subcutaneous boundary)
- Fragment composition matches local environmental debris (Jötunheim slag signature), not systemic metabolic deposition

The Iron Husk is not grown—it is built. Layer by painful layer, abrasion by abrasion, the Svin-fylking constructs its armor from the world's wreckage.

#### Berkano (ᛒ) Contamination Hypothesis

Healing efficiency exceeds Pre-Glitch baseline by factor of 2.3-2.8. This accelerated regeneration may indicate low-level Berkano (life-rune) corruption co-opted for armor maintenance. The corruption is functional—it aids survival rather than causing degradation.

### Tusk Sample Analysis

Left tusk recovered intact (42 cm length, 3.2 kg mass).

**Composition:**
- **Core:** Standard Sus scrofa tusk dentin and enamel
- **Surface:** Fused steel streaks penetrating 0.3-0.8 cm into bone structure
- **Apex:** Composite metal-bone edge, honed to blade sharpness

**Formation Mechanism:** Repeated abrasive sharpening against slag heaps creates micro-fractures in tusk surface; heated metal particles from friction bond to exposed bone during cooling.

### Diagnostic Conclusion

The Svin-fylking's Iron Husk represents convergent behavioral evolution—a non-genetic adaptation achieving quasi-mechanical augmentation through environmental exploitation. The creature's Pre-Glitch engineering for durability and omnivorous metabolism provided the biological foundation; post-Glitch survival pressure provided the selective force.

This specimen confirms that the Iron Husk is taught, not inherited. Young boars learn the behavior from adults. The armor is a cultural artifact as much as a biological one.

| Location | Knuckle-Bone Fields Sectors 6-K through 9-M; Midgard Greatwood Eastern Fringe |
| Evidence Tier | A (Verified) |
| Sample Size | 12 distinct sounders; 847 observation hours |

### Minimal Log Context

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date Window | 14-month longitudinal study spanning two Boar Moon cycles |
| Observer | Joint Jötun-Reader / Rangers Guild field team (4 personnel, rotating) |
| Threshold | Non-contact observation protocol; minimum 80 m standoff maintained |
| Decision | Extended study authorized following Year 781 stampede incident mortality review |
| Outcome | Comprehensive behavioral baseline established; operational thresholds validated |
| Owner | Rangers Guild Field Operations Command / Scriptorium-Primus (joint custody) |

### Survey Methodology

**Observation Protocol:**
- Dawn and dusk observation windows (peak activity periods)
- Elevated observation positions (ruin structures, slag heaps)
- Acoustic discipline enforced (≤60 dB at observation post)
- No direct interaction; natural behavior only

**Data Collection:**
- Charge event documentation (47 observed charges)
- Territorial marking behavior (wallow sites, sharpening stations)
- Feeding patterns and migration routes
- Intra-sounder hierarchy dynamics

### Charge Mechanics Findings

#### Formation Parameters (47 Observed Charges)

**Trigger Events:**
- Territorial incursion by non-pack fauna: 62%
- Human/humanoid presence detected: 23%
- Inter-sounder territorial dispute: 11%
- Unknown/unclear trigger: 4%

**Formation Development Timeline:**
- Initial agitation to charge posture: 15-45 seconds
- Charge posture to full velocity: 8-12 seconds
- Sustained charge duration: 20-90 seconds (terrain dependent)

**Velocity Measurements:**
- Initial burst: 8-10 m/s
- Sustained charge: 4-6 m/s
- Post-charge deceleration: 15-30 seconds to walking pace

**Formation Density:**
- Optimal: 0.5-0.7 animals per meter lane width
- Stampede cascade threshold: ≥0.7 animals per meter (observed in 3 charges; resulted in uncontrolled scatter rather than coordinated wedge)

#### Lead Boar (Járn-göltr) Behavior

- Apex position in all 47 observed charges
- Flight/fight decision-making for entire sounder
- First to engage threats; flanks protect during charge
- Replacement succession observed once (lead boar death from Scrap-Swarm engagement; largest sub-adult assumed position within 6 hours)

### Territorial Behavior

#### Wallow Sites

- **Dimensions:** 5-10 m diameter, 1-2 m depth
- Rust-stained mud characteristic
- Territorial markers; defended aggressively (3 observed charge events triggered by wallow approach)
- Used for thermal regulation, parasite control, and armor maintenance

#### Sharpening Stations

- Located at slag heaps and rebar tangles
- Multiple animals use same station in rotation
- Hierarchy-based access (lead boar priority)
- Approach within 30 m triggered charge posture in 100% of observed instances

#### Territory Size

- Range: 20-50 km² per sounder
- Overlap zones common but contested
- Seasonal compression during Boar Moon (migration to Midgard fringe)

### Aversion Response Testing

#### Acoustic Deterrent Validation

**2-Short-1-Long Bell Cadence:**
- Tested at 100 m distance on 8 occasions
- Aversion response (retreat or freeze): 87.5% (7/8)
- Single failure: sounder already in charge posture; momentum overcame aversion

**Acoustic Ceiling Confirmation:**
- Sounds exceeding 85 dB triggered agitation in 91% of observations
- Recommendation: Maintain ≤85 dB during all proximity operations

#### Visual Deterrent Testing

**Strobe/White Flood Light:**
- Startle response confirmed
- Temporary disorientation (5-15 seconds)
- NOT effective once charge initiated
- Utility: Pre-emptive deterrent only

### Re-Group Cadence

Following charge dispersal:
- Sounder re-formation: 5-8 minutes at designated rally points
- Rally points: Wallow sites or sharpening stations (familiar territory)
- Vulnerable window for extraction operations

### Operational Recommendations

Based on 14 months of observation, the following thresholds are validated for field operations:

1. **Stand-off Distance:** ≥50 m minimum; ≥80 m if piglets or wallow visible
2. **Acoustic Ceiling:** ≤85 dB during proximity operations
3. **Velocity Gate:** Abort engagement if herd velocity exceeds 6 m/s
4. **Density Threshold:** Black-flag if formation density reaches ≥0.7 animals/m lane
5. **Aversion Protocol:** 2-short-1-long bell cadence for non-contact deterrent
6. **Extraction Window:** 5-8 minutes post-dispersal before re-group

Dialectal features and oral-first cadence preserved. No Layer 2 or Layer 3 terminology intrudes upon the mythic register.

### The Saga of the Iron-Husks

*[Opening invocation, traditionally spoken]*

> Hear now, children of the Broken Age,
>
> Of beasts that learned what gods forgot—
>
> That iron is patient, and rust is wise,
>
> And the world gives armor to those who ask.

*[Refrain — audience responds: "And so it was"]*

---

*[First stanza: The Before-Time]*

> In the days when the Forge-Halls hummed,
>
> When the All-Father's eye saw all,
>
> There were pigs in the garden-decks,
>
> Fat and foolish, fed by machine.
>
> They ate the scraps that men discarded,
>
> Turned rot to rich soil for the growing,
>
> Docile as stones, dull as the fed,
>
> Waiting for bells that told them: *eat*.

*[Refrain: "And so it was"]*

---

*[Second stanza: The Silence]*

> Then came the Silence, the great unmaking,
>
> When the Forge-Gods choked on their own fire.
>
> The bells stopped ringing. The feed-troughs emptied.
>
> The garden-walls cracked and fell.
>
> The pigs, abandoned, wandered out
>
> Into a world of broken metal,
>
> Where every step drew blood from hooves,
>
> And starvation walked beside them.

*[Refrain: "And so it was"]*

---

*[Third stanza: The Learning]*

> But pigs are clever, cleverer than men,
>
> Who weep and wail when the world changes.
>
> The pigs looked at the rust and said:
>
> *"This is food. This is armor. This is ours."*
>
> They rolled in slag until their hides
>
> Grew thick with scars and stolen steel.
>
> They sharpened tusks on giant-bones,
>
> Until their teeth were forged as blades.

*[Refrain: "And so it was"]*

---

*[Fourth stanza: The Becoming]*

> Now they thunder across the wastes,
>
> The Járn-göltr leading, iron-crowned,
>
> A mountain that has learned to charge,
>
> A wall of rust that knows no fear.
>
> They are the children of the wasteland,
>
> And they have learned to wear its armor.
>
> The Forge-Gods made the world of iron,
>
> And the boar said: *"This iron is mine."*

*[Refrain: "And so it was"]*

---

*[Closing invocation]*

> So when you walk the Knuckle-Bones,
>
> And feel the ground begin to shake,
>
> Remember: you are in *their* home now,
>
> And they have earned the right to stay.
>
> Do not run. Do not scream.
>
> Be still as stone, be quiet as rust.
>
> For the Iron-Husks do not hate you—
>
> They simply do not know you matter.

*[Final refrain: "And so it was. And so it is."]*

### Collector's Notes

Völund One-Tooth claims this saga has been passed through "six mouths" since its composition, placing original authorship approximately Year 750-760 PG. Cross-reference with other Gutter-Skald performances confirms core narrative elements (pre-Glitch docility, post-Glitch adaptation, iron integration) are consistent across variants.

The saga's interpretation of Svin-fylking behavior aligns remarkably well with Layer 2 diagnostic findings, suggesting oral tradition has preserved accurate behavioral observations despite mythic framing.

**Layer Translation:**
- "Forge-Halls" = Pre-Glitch arcology habitation decks
- "All-Father's eye" = O.D.I.N. surveillance systems
- "Bells that told them eat" = Acoustic feeding cue conditioning
- "Garden-decks" = Midgard bio-dome park systems

| Patrol Labor (Boar Moon) | 10-20% workforce | Lost productivity |

#### Documented Raid Losses (Year 783 PG Aggregate)

- **Structural Damage:** 800-2,000 PS per major breach
- **Livestock Losses:** 500-1,500 PS (breeding stock replacement)
- **Crop Destruction:** 700-1,500 PS (replanting + lost harvest)
- **Total Boar Moon Losses (Midgard Combine):** 2,000-5,000 PS per cycle

### Hunting Operation Economics

#### Standard Hunting Party (6-8 personnel)

**Costs:**
- Equipment and provisions: 50-100 CU
- Guild fees (Rangers escort): 80-150 CU
- Baffle and deterrent supplies: 30-60 CU
- **Total Investment:** 160-310 CU

**Expected Mortality:**
- Industry average: 8-15% of hunting party per operation
- Conservative estimate: 1 death per 8-12 successful hunts
- Mortality compensation (to family/guild): 200-400 CU

**Break-Even Analysis:**
- Single adult kill covers costs with 50-440 CU margin
- Lead boar kill provides 490-1,190 CU margin
- **Adjusted for mortality risk:** Net margin reduced to 100-300 CU per successful hunt after compensation reserve

### Risk-Reward Assessment

#### Iron-Cartel Classification: HIGH RISK / MODERATE REWARD

The Svin-fylking represents an economically viable salvage target *only* under the following conditions:

1. **Full-strength hunting party** (minimum 6 personnel)
2. **Rangers Guild escort** or equivalent tactical expertise
3. **Acoustic deterrent equipment** (bells, baffles)
4. **Rapid extraction capability** (before Scrap-Swarm arrival)
5. **Pre-negotiated salvage rights** (avoid inter-clan disputes)

#### Recommendation

> *"The Iron-Husk is not worth dying for. But if the opportunity presents—if the beast dies by other means, if the path is clear, if the Swarm has not yet arrived—then it is worth claiming. The hide alone pays for a season's provisions. The tusks buy respect. The meat... well, the meat keeps body and soul together when nothing else will."*

| Owner | Scriptorium-Primus, Division of Post-Glitch Ecology |

### Specimen Catalog

**Primary Specimen:** Left tusk, adult male Svin-fylking
- Length: 42 cm (intact)
- Mass: 3.2 kg
- Curvature: Standard *Sus scrofa* growth pattern
- Surface: Extensive metal integration; honed edge

**Secondary Specimens:** Right tusk fragment (12 cm, broken); 3 juvenile tusks from separate recovery (15-22 cm)

### Composition Analysis

#### Cross-Section Structure

1. **Core (70-75% of mass):** Standard *Sus scrofa* tusk composition
   - Dentin matrix (primary structural component)
   - Pulp cavity (nutrient delivery, sensation)
   - Enamel coating (exterior, partial wear)

2. **Surface Integration Zone (25-30% of mass):**
   - Steel streaks penetrating 0.3-0.8 cm into dentin
   - Oxidized iron deposits in surface scratches
   - Heat-fused metal beads at high-friction contact points

3. **Apex (Cutting Edge):**
   - Composite structure: alternating bone/metal layers
   - Edge geometry: Honed to blade profile (approximately 15-20° edge angle)
   - Surface hardness: Exceeds unfused bone by factor of 1.8-2.2

### Formation Mechanism

#### Phase 1: Natural Growth

Tusk develops through standard *Sus scrofa* growth patterns. Juvenile tusks show no metal integration until approximately 4-6 months post-natal (corresponding to observed "Initiation Phase" of Iron Husk development).

#### Phase 2: Breakage and Abrasion

Adult tusks show evidence of repeated breakage and re-sharpening. The specimen's left tusk displays at least 3 distinct break-and-regrowth boundaries, indicating the tusk was broken and re-honed multiple times during the subject's life.

#### Phase 3: Heat-Friction Fusion

The critical discovery: metal integration occurs through **friction-generated heat bonding**.

When the boar sharpens its tusk against slag heaps or rebar:
- Friction generates localized temperatures of 150-300°C
- Metal particles from the abrasive surface heat and soften
- Particles bond to exposed dentin at the tusk surface
- Cooling locks particles into bone micro-fractures

This process is repeated hundreds of times over the animal's life, building up layers of metal integration.

#### Phase 4: Composite Edge Formation

Over time, the accumulated metal creates a composite cutting edge:
- Bone provides flexibility and impact absorption
- Metal provides hardness and edge retention
- Alternating layers create a natural "Damascus" effect
- Result: A blade that is harder than bone alone, more flexible than metal alone

### Lethality Assessment

#### Penetration Capacity

- **Unarmored human torso:** Full penetration (40+ cm depth possible)
- **Leather armor:** Full penetration with reduced depth
- **Wooden palisade (standard construction):** Penetration to 8-15 cm depth
- **Metal armor (light):** Partial penetration or significant denting

#### Strike Force

Combined with the Svin-fylking's charge velocity (4-10 m/s) and body mass (800-2,000+ kg), a tusk strike delivers force equivalent to a siege weapon impact. The composite edge allows repeated strikes without significant degradation.

#### Comparison to Manufactured Weapons

The forged tusk is comparable to a heavy spear or short sword in terms of penetration and cutting capacity. It exceeds most salvaged weapons in durability due to the bone core's flexibility.

### Salvage Applications

#### Direct Use

Recovered tusks require minimal processing for use as:
- Daggers (15-25 cm specimens)
- Short swords (30-45 cm specimens)
- Spear points (broken tusks, apex sections)

#### Material Harvesting

Metal streaks can be extracted through:
- Acid dissolution of bone matrix (complex, wasteful)
- Grinding and separation (labor-intensive, low yield)
- Direct use as composite material (recommended)

#### Market Value Factors

- Intact adult tusks: Premium (weapon-ready)
- Lead boar tusks (70+ cm): Exceptional premium (prestige + practical value)
- Broken fragments: Standard rate (tool components)

### Diagnostic Conclusion

The Svin-fylking's "forged tusks" represent the second major example of behavioral adaptation creating quasi-mechanical augmentation (alongside the Iron Husk dermal armor).

The creature has learned to use the physics of friction and heat to *manufacture weapons from its own body*. This is not mutation. This is not magic. This is a pig that taught itself metallurgy.

> *The Svin-fylking carries a forge in its mouth. Every time it sharpens its tusks, it is smithing.*
