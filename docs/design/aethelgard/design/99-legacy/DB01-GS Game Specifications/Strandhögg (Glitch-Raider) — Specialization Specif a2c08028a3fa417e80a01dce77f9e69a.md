# Strandhögg (Glitch-Raider) — Specialization Specification v5.0

## I. Core Philosophy: The Exploiter of the System Crash

The Strandhögg is the Warrior specialization that thrives where reality flickers. They are glitch-raiders and opportunistic finishers—cleaners of fractures who end fights before they can fully form. Strike at lags and stutters; keep moving; leave only broken signals and missing pieces.

**Flow: Approach quiet. Breach sudden. Exploit instability. Exit before echoes resolve.**

### Core Identity

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Archetype | Warrior |
| Path Type | Coherent (edge-walking) |
| Mechanical Role | Burst Damage / Finisher |
| Primary Attribute | FINESSE |
| Resource System | Stamina + Pace |
| Trauma Economy Risk | Low |

### Core Fantasy Delivered

You are the tide-knife—the raider who strikes when command speaks into silence. In a world fractured by the Glitch, you have learned to weaponize instability itself. Where others see chaos, you see opportunity. Where others freeze in horror at a stuttering Undying, you are already there, blade in its throat. You do not fight wars; you decapitate them.

---

## II. Design Pillars

### A. Pace Resource System

The Strandhögg builds **Pace** through movement and exploiting enemy weakness, then spends it on devastating execution chains.

**Pace Mechanics:**

- **Maximum:** 100 Pace
- **Generation:**
    - Movement: +5 per tile moved
    - Clean strike: +10
    - Exploit fear/confusion/stillness: +15
- **Spends:**
    - Execution chain: -30
    - Strike-and-vanish: -20
    - Riptide sequence: -80
- **Decay:** -10 at end of turn with no motion or contact

**Thresholds:**

- 25 Pace: Surge ready
- 50 Pace: Whirlwind window
- 75 Pace: Riptide prep
- 100 Pace: Execution peak

### B. Attention Craft

Confuse the ear and blind the eye; your work succeeds when command speaks into silence. The Strandhögg exploits:

- Tide, fog, relay hand-offs, ritual clocks, gate rotations
- Enter on the off-beat; strike when they're looking the other way

### C. The Finisher Role

You don't start fights—you end them. Maximum damage against already-compromised targets:

- [Feared], [Stunned], [Confused], [Disoriented]
- Any target whose rhythm is broken

## IV. Systemic Integration

### Strategic Role

**The Finisher:** Clears marked threats already shaken by control effects; closes loops so the field calms. The Strandhögg doesn't start the chaos—they end it decisively.

### Layered Interpretation

| Layer | Perspective |
| --- | --- |
| **Layer 1 (Mythic)** | Sacred storm-raid; omens and war-song guide the tide-knife |
| **Layer 2 (Diagnostic)** | Doctrine of attention fracture and opportunity harvesting under a broken world's lag |
| **Layer 3 (Technical)** | Pre-Glitch littoral playbook—signal suppression, relay decapitation, timed breaching |

### Party Synergies

| Specialization | Synergy |
| --- | --- |
| **Controllers (Hlekkr-master, etc.)** | Seed fear, confusion, or stillness for Strandhögg to exploit |
| **Skjaldmær** | Hold the breach while raids execute |
| **Skald** | Tempo manipulation feeds Pace generation |
| **Other Skirmishers** | Wolf-pack lanes to unmake command nets |

### Vulnerabilities

- **Setup Dependent:** Needs allies to apply control effects for maximum damage
- **Riptide Cost:** Ultimate ability brushes the edge of Corruption
- **Sustained Fights:** Momentum-based; struggles in attrition combat

---

## V. Tactical Applications

### The Raiding Protocol

1. **Before the tide:** Routes planned, hooks ready, smoke prepared
2. **On approach:** Count the beats, eyes on relays, identify priority targets
3. **At breach:** Strike compromised targets first, build Pace rapidly
4. **Execution:** Savage Harvest wounded enemies, chain kills with No Quarter
5. **Exit:** Harrier's Whirlwind out, vanish before echoes resolve

### Field Notes

- Do not duel for pride; pick on fractures and leave.
- Keep an exit named before you enter; if it closes, the raid is over.
- Riptide costs mind and margin—reserve for when ending the fight ends the day.
