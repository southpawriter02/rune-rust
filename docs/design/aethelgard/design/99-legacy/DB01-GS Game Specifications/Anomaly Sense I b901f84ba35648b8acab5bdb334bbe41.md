## Thematic Description

> *"Your senses are attuned to wrongness. The subtle displacement of air, the faint hum of active systems, the almost-imperceptible flicker of unstable geometry—you perceive what kills others."*
> 

The Ruin-Stalker's survival begins with **perception**. Years of entry work have trained your senses to detect the telltale signs of Old World anomalies—the pressure changes, the acoustic harmonics, the visual distortions that precede disaster. Where others walk blind into death, you see the warnings.

## Mechanical Implementation

### Base Effect (Rank 1)

- +1d10 bonus to all **WITS checks** for detecting:
    - Traps
    - Anomalies
    - Hidden dangers
- Can **identify anomaly type** on successful perception check

### Rank 2

- +2d10 bonus (up from +1d10)
- Can estimate **anomaly danger level**: Minor / Moderate / Severe / Lethal
- **PP Cost**: 3

### Rank 3

- +3d10 bonus
- **Automatic detection** of all anomalies within 10 meters
- **Immune to surprise** from environmental hazards
- **PP Cost**: 3

## Anomaly Classification Table

| Anomaly Type | Description | Detection Cue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Echo Surface** | Reflective materials that copy movement/breath | Subtle double-image, slight delay in reflection |
| **Singing Vent** | Repeating tones that pull breath to match | Rhythmic vibration in chest, auditory paresthesia |
| **Animated Script** | Drifting runes responsive to gaze/sound | Characters shift at peripheral vision edges |
| **Loop Corridor** | Architecture that returns in short cycles | Déjà vu, distances feel wrong |
| **Frame Residue** | J.T.N. work-prints felt in the teeth | Metallic taste, pressure behind eyes |

## Danger Level Classification (Rank 2+)

| Level | Description | Typical Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Minor** | Nuisance-level hazard | 1d6 damage or minor debuff |
| **Moderate** | Significant threat | 2d8 damage or serious debuff |
| **Severe** | Life-threatening | 4d10 damage or incapacitation |
| **Lethal** | Immediate death without intervention | Death save or instant kill |

## Synergies

### Internal (Ruin-Stalker Tree)

- **Careful Advance**: Detection informs safe movement
- **Disarm Mechanism**: Must detect before disarming
- **Anomaly Exploitation**: Must identify before weaponizing
- **Corridor Maker**: Capstone builds on detection foundation

### External (Party Composition)

- **Jötun-Reader**: You detect, they translate
- **Rúnasmiðr**: You find Animated Script, they contain it
- **Any party**: Your perception keeps everyone alive

---

## Tactical Applications

### Standard Protocol

1. Enter new area cautiously
2. Roll WITS + Anomaly Sense bonus
3. Identify all anomalies and their types
4. Communicate dangers to party
5. Proceed with Careful Advance

### Rank 3: Automatic Detection

At Rank 3, you no longer need to actively search within 10 meters:

- Passive awareness of all nearby anomalies
- Cannot be ambushed by environmental hazards
- Party benefits from your constant vigilance

## v5.0 Compliance Notes

✅ **Technology, Not Magic**: Trained perception, not supernatural sight

✅ **Blight Integration**: Anomalies are Runic Blight expressions

✅ **CPS Framework**: Detection prevents dangerous exposure

✅ **Layer 2 Voice**: Professional survey terminology
