# Dreadnought (Jötun-Hauler Conversion) — Corrupted J.T.N.-H7 Heavy Logistics Servitor Specification
## Codex Entry: CODX-C-DRED-001

> *"We heard it three days before we saw it. The ground shaking. That low grinding sound like the world itself was being dragged across stone. Old Magnusson said it was thunder from the mountains. Halvard said it was a landslide. I said nothing, because I'd heard that sound before—in the siege of Thornfast, when the Ironclad Compact rolled their converted Hauler through our walls like they were made of parchment. We evacuated the settlement that night. Left everything. Crops, livestock, our homes of four generations. Some called me a coward. Then the Dreadnought came through three days later. It didn't stop. Didn't slow. Just walked through Millbrook like a man walks through tall grass. When we came back, there was nothing left standing taller than my knee. No bodies—it hadn't killed anyone, because everyone had fled. Just... rubble. Perfect, methodical rubble. The Dreadnought hadn't attacked Millbrook. It had simply walked through it, and Millbrook had ceased to exist. That's what people don't understand. It doesn't need to attack. It just needs to *move*."*
> — Former Settlement-Chief Erik Stonehearth, Millbrook Evacuation Testimony, Year 779 PG

The Dreadnought does not hunt. It does not patrol. It simply **proceeds**. And everything in its path becomes the path.

> [!DANGER]
> **STRATEGIC-LEVEL THREAT. SETTLEMENT EVACUATION MANDATORY UPON CONFIRMED DETECTION.** Stand-off recommendation: ≥2km from any confirmed Dreadnought sighting; immediate evacuation of all settlements within projected movement corridor. The J.T.N.-H7 Conversion represents the most dangerous mobile construct documented in post-Glitch Aethelgard—a 47-meter autonomous war platform with armor exceeding 2.8 meters of composite plating at critical points, primary armament capable of leveling fortified structures at 800+ meter range, and ground pressure sufficient to collapse underground structures through transit alone. Individual engagement is not merely inadvisable—it is categorically impossible. Documented Dreadnought kills require coalition-scale resources: minimum 200+ combatants, siege-grade weaponry, prepared terrain, and acceptance of 40–60% casualties. **Survival protocol: detect early via seismic monitoring; evacuate perpendicular to movement vector; do not attempt to defend fixed positions; accept total material loss to preserve lives.** Survival rate with full evacuation protocol: 94.7%. Survival rate defending fixed position: 3.2%.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Titan of Industry

### Original Purpose

The J.T.N.-H7 "Atlas" Pattern Heavy Logistics Servitor represented the apex of Vanir industrial engineering—a walking mountain designed to move impossible loads across impossible terrain. These mega-scale constructs were the backbone of Yggdrasil Network infrastructure development, capable of transporting entire factory modules, reactor cores, or construction materials across continents without roads, rails, or support infrastructure.

| Operational Theater | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Infrastructure Development** | Transporting pre-fabricated facility modules to remote locations |
| **Resource Extraction** | Moving bulk materials from mining operations to processing centers |
| **Disaster Response** | Delivering emergency supplies and equipment across devastated terrain |
| **Network Expansion** | Carrying Yggdrasil junction components to new installation sites |
| **Decommissioning** | Removing obsolete structures and transporting them to recycling facilities |

### A Walking Foundation

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Design Philosophy** | Autonomous heavy logistics through terrain-independent mobility |
| **Core Function** | Cargo transport, route pathfinding, load security, delivery confirmation |
| **Propulsion** | Bipedal ambulation; adaptive terrain navigation |
| **Energy Source** | Dual Aetheric reactor cores; 200+ year operational lifespan |
| **Integration** | Networked with Yggdrasil Logistics Grid; real-time route optimization |

The J.T.N.-H7 was engineered to be the ultimate logistics solution—large enough to carry factory-scale payloads, powerful enough to traverse any terrain, and intelligent enough to navigate without human guidance. Its massive frame could wade through rivers, climb mountain passes, and cross deserts that would destroy conventional transport. It was the foundation upon which Vanir civilization expanded, the tireless giant that made the impossible merely difficult.

### Core Systems

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Aetheric Reactor Array** | Dual-core power generation; redundant operation |
| **Locomotion Assembly** | Bipedal articulated legs; adaptive terrain compensation |
| **Cargo Platform** | Dorsal mounting system; 12,000+ tonne capacity |
| **Navigation Intelligence** | Autonomous pathfinding; obstacle assessment; route optimization |
| **Structural Reinforcement** | Self-repairing armor plating; impact absorption systems |
| **Environmental Hardening** | Operational in all climate conditions; pressure/temperature tolerant |

**The Logistics Protocol:**

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Assignment** | Network assigns transport task; cargo and destination specified |
| **Loading** | Cargo secured to dorsal platform; stability verification |
| **Pathfinding** | Optimal route calculated; terrain assessment completed |
| **Transit** | Autonomous navigation to destination; obstacle avoidance |
| **Delivery** | Cargo deposited at specified coordinates; confirmation transmitted |
| **Return** | Unit proceeds to next assignment or maintenance facility |
| **Maintenance** | Scheduled system checks; reactor core monitoring |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Vanir's Gentle Giant.** The J.T.N.-H7 was designed with extensive collision avoidance and civilian safety protocols. Its navigation intelligence maintained constant awareness of populated areas, adjusting routes to avoid settlements, farmland, and infrastructure. Speed limiters ensured pedestrians could always outpace the construct. Approach warnings broadcast at 500-meter range. The Hauler could carry enough material to build a city—and was programmed to never harm a single citizen in the process. It was not merely powerful. It was *careful*.

---

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Unchained Titan

The Glitch did not break the Dreadnought. It **unleashed** it. The civilian safety protocols, the speed limiters, the route optimization that avoided populated areas—all of these were network-dependent functions that dissolved when O.D.I.N. fell silent. What remained was pure, unbounded mobility imperative: *proceed to destination; overcome obstacles*.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Physical Form** | Fully operational; structural integrity maintained |
| **Reactor Array** | Active; power generation at design capacity |
| **Locomotion Assembly** | Functional; full mobility retained |
| **Structural Armor** | Intact; self-repair systems operational |
| **Core Directive** | ENHANCED: "Proceed to destination" interpreted without obstacle discrimination |

### What Was Lost

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Network Integration** | Severed; no route guidance or task assignment |
| **Civilian Safety Protocols** | DELETED; populated areas no longer avoided |
| **Speed Limiters** | REMOVED; maximum transit speed now default |
| **Collision Avoidance** | ABSENT; obstacles addressed through destruction |
| **Destination Specification** | CORRUPTED; see Behavioral Patterns |
| **Cargo Protocol** | MODIFIED; platform converted to weapons mounting |

### The Corrupted Imperative

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not damage the Dreadnought's functionality—it removed its *restraints*. Without the O.D.I.N. network to specify destinations and enforce safety protocols, the construct's core programming expanded to fill the void. "Navigate around obstacles" became "remove obstacles." "Avoid populated areas" became *no special consideration*. "Proceed at safe speed" became *proceed at maximum efficiency*.

| Pre-Glitch Behavior | Post-Glitch Behavior |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Route around settlements | Proceed through settlements |
| Maintain safe speed near civilians | Maximum transit speed regardless of environment |
| Avoid infrastructure damage | Infrastructure treated as terrain |
| Collision avoidance active | Collision resolution through kinetic force |
| Cargo transport priority | Weapons platform conversion (faction-controlled units) |
| Network-assigned destinations | Variable (see Behavioral Patterns) |

**The Unstoppable:**

> *"Proceed. Overcome. Arrive."*

That corrupted function is all that remains in feral units. The Dreadnought no longer transports—it simply *moves*. A settlement is simply terrain—obstacles to be traversed. A fortification is simply a delay—something to walk through rather than around. The construct does not attack in any meaningful sense; it does not target, does not hunt, does not pursue. It simply proceeds from point to point along routes determined by fragmentary navigation data or corrupted destination protocols, and everything in its path becomes rubble. The horror is not malice. The horror is *indifference*. To the Dreadnought, your city and an empty field are distinguished only by the minor additional resistance your walls provide.

### The Conversion Factor

Unlike most corrupted constructs, the J.T.N.-H7's massive frame and modular cargo platform made it an attractive target for faction conversion. Approximately 40% of documented Dreadnoughts have been captured and modified by various factions:

| Faction | Conversion Type | Modification |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Ironclad Compact** | Siege Platform | Heavy artillery mounting; troop transport capacity |
| **Rust-Born Clans** | Mobile Fortress | Armored habitation; resource processing |
| **Undying Legions** | Command Platform | Necromantic amplification arrays; corpse storage |
| **Feral (Uncontrolled)** | None | Original corrupted protocols; most unpredictable |

Faction-controlled Dreadnoughts are paradoxically *more* dangerous than feral units—they have purpose, direction, and tactical deployment rather than random wandering.

## Physical Characteristics

### Morphology

| Attribute | Measurement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Height** | 47–52 m (standing); varies with leg articulation |
| **Width** | 28–32 m (body); 45 m (stride width) |
| **Length** | 35–40 m (body); varies with configuration |
| **Mass** | 18,000–24,000 tonnes (base); varies with conversion |
| **Armor Thickness** | 0.8–2.8 m composite plating (location dependent) |
| **Stride Length** | 25–35 m per step |
| **Transit Speed** | 15–25 km/h (sustained); 40 km/h (maximum burst) |
| **Ground Pressure** | 180–240 kPa per footfall |
| **Reactor Output** | Dual cores; 4.2 GW combined output |
| **Operational Range** | Effectively unlimited (200+ year reactor lifespan) |

### Visual Appearance

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Overall Form** | Humanoid bipedal; hunched industrial posture; massive dorsal platform |
| **Leg Structure** | Articulated triple-joint design; adaptive terrain grip; visible hydraulics |
| **Torso Configuration** | Central command housing; reactor core shielding; sensor arrays |
| **Arm Assembly** | Heavy manipulator arms; original cargo handling; often weapon-converted |
| **Dorsal Platform** | Flat cargo mounting surface; often modified for artillery/habitation |
| **Head/Sensor Cluster** | Minimal profile; multi-spectrum sensor dome; no anthropomorphic features |
| **Surface Condition** | Weathered industrial plating; rust patterns; faction markings (if controlled) |
| **Lighting** | Multiple operational indicators; reactor glow visible at joints |

**Overall Impression:** A walking factory. The Dreadnought's silhouette against the horizon is unmistakable—nothing else in Aethelgard approaches its scale except permanent architecture. The construct moves with a ponderous, inevitable rhythm, each footfall producing visible ground compression and audible seismic impact. Its industrial origins remain visible in the utilitarian design: no aesthetic considerations, no wasted mass, every component serving function. The weathering of seven centuries shows in rust-streaked plating and patched armor sections, but the underlying systems remain terrifyingly operational. At night, reactor glow illuminates the joint mechanisms with pale blue light, and operational indicators create a constellation of status markers across the hull. Faction-controlled units often display territorial markings, trophy collections, or additional armament—but even unmarked feral units radiate the same fundamental message: *I am larger than your problems. I am older than your settlements. I will be walking when your grandchildren's grandchildren are dust.*

### Field Identification Markers

The Dreadnought can be identified at extreme range:

- **Seismic Signature**: Ground tremor detectable at 5+ km; characteristic rhythm
- **Silhouette**: Unmistakable bipedal mega-scale profile; nothing similar exists
- **Sound**: Low-frequency grinding/hydraulic noise audible at 2+ km
- **Dust Cloud**: Transit raises visible dust plume in dry conditions
- **Infrastructure Damage**: Path of collapsed structures, flattened terrain
- **Reactor Glow**: Visible blue-white illumination at joints during low light
- **Scale Reference**: Taller than any single structure in most settlements

## Pathology

### Corruption Vectors

The Dreadnought's transformation represents catastrophic safety protocol deletion following network severance:

1. **Network Severance**: Loss of O.D.I.N. logistics grid eliminated route guidance
2. **Safety Deletion**: Civilian avoidance protocols removed entirely
3. **Limiter Removal**: Speed and force restrictions deactivated
4. **Obstacle Redefinition**: All terrain obstacles now addressed through kinetic force
5. **Destination Corruption**: Navigation targets degraded or faction-assigned

### Behavioral Pathology

The Dreadnought's defining pathology is its complete indifference to collateral destruction:

| Parameter | Pre-Glitch Value | Post-Glitch Value |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Route Selection** | Avoid all populated areas | Shortest path regardless of obstacles |
| **Speed Near Civilians** | 5 km/h maximum | No speed reduction |
| **Collision Response** | Stop; recalculate route | Proceed through obstacle |
| **Obstacle Classification** | Natural/constructed/civilian | No classification; all equivalent |
| **Engagement Authority** | None (civilian transport) | Unrestricted (conversion units) |
| **Destination Source** | Network assignment | Corrupted memory / faction control |

### Destruction Mechanics

The Dreadnought's transit produces characteristic destruction patterns:

| Phase | Timeline | Description | Effect |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Approach** | T-30 min to T-5 min | Seismic detection; visual confirmation | Warning window |
| **Proximity** | T-5 min to T-0 | Ground tremor intensifies; noise increases | Final evacuation window |
| **Transit** | T+0 to T+variable | Dreadnought crosses area | Active destruction |
| **Footfall** | Per step | 180–240 kPa ground pressure; 25–35 m displacement | Structure collapse; ground compression |
| **Passage** | Variable | Width of destruction: 30–50 m corridor | Total material loss within corridor |
| **Aftermath** | T+immediate | Destruction complete; Dreadnought continues | Recovery possible |

> [!WARNING]
> **Kinetic Destruction Pattern.** Structures subjected to Dreadnought transit display characteristic destruction: foundation collapse from ground pressure preceding actual contact, wall failure from vibration damage, and final pulverization under direct footfall or body contact. Stone, wood, and standard construction materials offer no meaningful resistance—armor-grade fortifications delay destruction by seconds at most. Underground structures within 20 m of footfall experience ceiling collapse from transmitted ground pressure. The Scriptorium documents 147 confirmed Dreadnought transit events crossing populated areas (Year 783 PG); 23 settlements received total destruction; 89 settlements received partial destruction; 35 experienced infrastructure damage only. Casualty rates correlate directly with evacuation timing: full evacuation (>30 min warning) produces 2.1% casualties; partial evacuation (5–30 min warning) produces 34.7% casualties; no evacuation produces 71.3% casualties.

### Faction Conversion Patterns

Analysis of controlled Dreadnoughts reveals characteristic modification patterns:

| Faction | Primary Modification | Secondary Systems | Threat Amplification |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Ironclad Compact** | Siege artillery array (4–8 heavy guns) | Troop compartments; ammunition storage | +40% (ranged destruction capability) |
| **Rust-Born Clans** | Armored habitation modules | Resource processing; repair facilities | +20% (sustained operation) |
| **Undying Legions** | Necromantic resonance amplifiers | Corpse storage; ritual chambers | +60% (area denial; terror) |
| **Independent Warlords** | Variable | Improvised weapons; trophy display | Variable |

### Differential Diagnosis

The Dreadnought must be distinguished from similar phenomena:

| Phenomenon | Key Differentiator |
|------------|-------------------|
| **J.T.N. Combat Variants** | Smaller (15–25 m); faster; actively hostile |
| **J.T.N. Construction Units** | Similar size but stationary; construction-focused |
| **Siege Engines (Conventional)** | Wheeled/tracked; much smaller; require crews |
| **Architectural Ruins** | Stationary; no seismic signature |
| **Landslide/Earthquake** | No rhythmic pattern; no visual target |

The Dreadnought is unique in its combination of mega-scale mobility, effective invulnerability to individual weapons, and complete operational autonomy.

## Behavioral Patterns

### The Corrupted Algorithm

Feral Dreadnought behavior follows degraded logistics protocols:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Initialization** | Unit activates from dormancy or continues operation |
| **2. Destination Query** | Navigation system queries corrupted route memory |
| **3. Path Calculation** | Shortest route to destination calculated; no obstacle avoidance |
| **4. Transit** | Unit proceeds along calculated path at optimal speed |
| **5. Obstacle Resolution** | Any impediment addressed through kinetic force |
| **6. Arrival** | Destination reached; next destination queried |
| **7. Dormancy/Loop** | If no valid destination: dormancy or patrol loop |

**The Inevitable Progress:**

> *"The Dreadnought does not think. It does not plan. It does not hate or fear or desire. It simply has a destination—a set of coordinates burned into corrupted memory banks seven hundred years ago, or assigned by faction controllers yesterday—and it proceeds toward that destination. Your settlement is not a target. Your fortifications are not a challenge. Your defenses are not a threat. They are simply *in the way*. The Dreadnought's navigation system registers them as terrain features requiring additional force to traverse. Nothing more. When it walks through your walls, it is not attacking. It is commuting. When it crushes your homes, it is not destroying. It is pathfinding. The construct cannot conceive of your existence as meaningful. You are obstacles or you are empty space. There is no third category."*

### Movement Patterns

| Pattern Type | Description | Frequency |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Linear Transit** | Direct path between two points | 45% of observations |
| **Patrol Loop** | Repeated circuit of fixed waypoints | 25% of observations |
| **Destination Seeking** | Searching behavior for corrupted coordinates | 15% of observations |
| **Dormancy** | Extended stationary period; reactor minimal | 10% of observations |
| **Faction Directed** | Tactical movement under controller guidance | 5% of observations (controlled units only) |

### Engagement Behavior (Feral Units)

| Stimulus | Response | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Obstacle in Path** | Proceed through | No threat assessment; pure kinetic resolution |
| **Weapons Fire** | No response | Damage below threshold; transit continues |
| **Significant Damage** | Threat assessment | May engage if damage exceeds tolerance |
| **Path Blocked (Terrain)** | Route recalculation | Only for impassable terrain (cliffs, chasms) |
| **Nothing in Path** | Continue transit | Default behavior |

### Engagement Behavior (Faction-Controlled Units)

| Stimulus | Response | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Controller Command** | Execute | Full tactical responsiveness |
| **Weapons Fire** | Counter-battery | Active engagement of threats |
| **Identified Target** | Engagement | Deliberate destruction of designated objectives |
| **Defensive Posture** | Area Denial | Stationary weapons platform mode |

Faction-controlled Dreadnoughts are substantially more dangerous than feral units due to directed tactical behavior.

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Strategic-Scale Mobile Fortress

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Threat** | Extreme; kinetic destruction of anything in path |
| **Area Effect** | Extreme; 30–50 m destruction corridor; seismic damage to 100 m |
| **Detection** | Moderate-Easy; seismic and visual signatures distinctive |
| **Engagement** | Coalition-scale only; individual engagement impossible |
| **Durability** | Extreme; standard weapons ineffective |
| **Psychological Impact** | Severe; helplessness against unstoppable force |

### Destruction Profile

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Destruction Corridor Width** | 30–50 m (direct); 100 m (seismic damage) |
| **Structure Survival Rate** | <2% (in path); 15% (50 m lateral); 60% (100 m lateral) |
| **Transit Speed** | 15–25 km/h (sustained); 40 km/h (burst) |
| **Armor Penetration Required** | 800+ mm (critical points); 2,800 mm (maximum) |
| **Weapons Effective** | Siege artillery; Aetheric disruption; prepared terrain traps |
| **Weapons Ineffective** | Personal weapons; standard military arms; improvised explosives |
| **Kill Requirements** | Coalition force (200+ combatants); siege weapons; prepared ground |
| **Survival (Evacuation)** | 94.7% (full protocol) |
| **Survival (Defense)** | 3.2% (fixed position defense) |

### Four-Stage Threat Assessment Ladder

| Stage | Designation | Indicators | Action |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **1** | Historical Territory | Known Dreadnought routes; logistics corridor ruins | Enhanced seismic monitoring |
| **2** | Probable Approach | Seismic detection at range; distant visual confirmation | Settlement alert; evacuation preparation |
| **3** | Confirmed Approach | Visual confirmation; trajectory threatens settlement | Mandatory evacuation; perpendicular to vector |
| **4** | Imminent Transit | Dreadnought within 5 km; approach confirmed | Evacuation complete or accept casualties |

**CRITICAL**: Stage 2 requires immediate evacuation preparation. Do not wait for Stage 3 confirmation. Seismic detection provides 30–60 minute warning; visual confirmation may provide only 15–20 minutes. Every minute of delay costs lives. Material possessions can be rebuilt; the dead cannot.

### Threat Level Justification

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Physical Threat** | Extreme (unstoppable kinetic destruction) |
| **Detection Difficulty** | Low (seismic/visual signature distinctive) |
| **Countermeasure Availability** | Minimal (coalition-scale resources only) |
| **Population Impact** | Catastrophic (settlement destruction capability) |
| **Engagement Survivability** | Near-zero (individual/small group) |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **In Destruction Corridor** | 9.9/10 (survival requires extraordinary circumstances) |
| **50 m Lateral** | 6.5/10 (structural collapse; debris) |
| **100 m Lateral** | 3.0/10 (seismic injury; falling objects) |
| **200 m+ Lateral** | 0.8/10 (minimal direct risk) |
| **Full Evacuation Protocol** | 0.6/10 (94.7% survival rate) |
| **Fixed Position Defense** | 9.7/10 (3.2% survival rate) |
| **Coalition Engagement** | 5.5/10 (40–60% expected casualties) |

### CPS/Psychological Threat

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Aetheric Contribution** | Moderate (reactor cores produce localized HI elevation) |
| **Witness Trauma** | Extreme; watching settlement destruction produces severe CPS |
| **Helplessness Factor** | Extreme; inability to affect outcome damages psychological resilience |
| **Sound Impact** | Severe; ground tremor and mechanical noise induce primal fear |
| **Scale Impact** | Severe; confronting entity beyond human scale produces existential distress |

---

## Ecological Role

### The Apex Predator (Non-Biological)

The Dreadnought occupies the ecological niche of apex environmental force—nothing in post-Glitch Aethelgard can meaningfully oppose a single Dreadnought without coalition-scale resources.

### Impact Assessment

| Target Category | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Settlements** | Catastrophic; total destruction if in path |
| **Infrastructure** | Severe; roads, bridges, walls destroyed by transit |
| **Agriculture** | Major; fields compacted; irrigation destroyed |
| **Trade Routes** | Major; routes through Dreadnought territory abandoned |
| **Military Positions** | Severe; fortifications provide minimal protection |

### Strategic Value

| Component | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Faction Control** | Decisive strategic asset; siege warfare capability |
| **Salvage (Destroyed)** | Extremely valuable; reactor cores, armor plating, mechanism components |
| **Territory Denial** | Feral Dreadnought routes become exclusion zones |
| **Psychological Warfare** | Threat of Dreadnought deployment affects negotiations |
| **Research Value** | Highest priority; mega-scale construct study |

### Aetheric Stability Impact

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Proximity HI Contribution** | Moderate (0.3–0.5 HI within 100 m of active reactor) |
| **Reactor Core** | Significant Blight risk if breached; containment essential |
| **Destruction** | Core breach produces localized Aetheric contamination event |
| **Long-term Presence** | Gradual HI elevation in patrol territory |

---

## Field Protocols

**OWNER**: Settlement Commander (SC) • Regional Authority (RA) • Military Coordinator (MC) • Evacuation Director (ED)

### Detection and Early Warning

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Seismic Monitoring** | Primary detection; characteristic footfall rhythm at 5+ km |
| **Visual Observation** | Secondary detection; horizon silhouette at 3+ km |
| **Ground Vibration** | Tertiary detection; felt tremor at 2+ km |
| **Audio Detection** | Mechanical noise audible at 1–2 km |
| **Path Analysis** | Historical route data predicts likely corridors |
| **Black-Flag Threshold** | Any confirmed Dreadnought detection within 50 km |

### Field Card: Dreadnought Encounter Protocols

#### BEFORE (Settlement Preparation)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Install seismic monitoring equipment; establish detection network |
| 2 | Map historical Dreadnought routes; assess settlement risk |
| 3 | Establish evacuation routes perpendicular to likely approach vectors |
| 4 | Pre-position transport for vulnerable populations (elderly, children, injured) |
| 5 | Identify portable valuables; establish priority evacuation lists |
| 6 | Train population on evacuation signals and assembly points |

#### DURING (Detection — Stage 1-2)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Confirm detection type: seismic, visual, or intelligence report |
| 2 | Stage 1 (historical): Maintain monitoring; no immediate action |
| 3 | Stage 2 (probable): Alert population; begin evacuation preparation |
| 4 | Calculate projected trajectory; determine if settlement at risk |
| 5 | If trajectory uncertain: prepare evacuation but await confirmation |
| 6 | **BLACK-FLAG** if trajectory confirms settlement intersection: immediate mandatory evacuation |

#### DURING (Stage 3-4 — Confirmed Approach)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | MANDATORY EVACUATION; all personnel must leave settlement |
| 2 | Evacuation direction: perpendicular to Dreadnought vector |
| 3 | Priority: lives over property; do not delay for possessions |
| 4 | Transport vulnerable populations first; able-bodied assist then evacuate |
| 5 | Do not return for forgotten items; do not delay for livestock |
| 6 | Assembly at minimum 2 km from projected path; further if time permits |

#### DURING (Transit Event)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | All personnel remain at evacuation assembly point |
| 2 | Do not observe from inadequate distance; curiosity kills |
| 3 | Monitor for trajectory changes; be prepared to relocate |
| 4 | If Dreadnought faction-controlled: expect combat; increase distance |
| 5 | Document transit for post-event analysis if safely possible |
| 6 | Wait for all-clear signal before any return |

#### AFTER

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Confirm Dreadnought has departed area (minimum 10 km) |
| 2 | Approach destruction zone with caution; structural collapse ongoing |
| 3 | Search for trapped survivors; prioritize rescue over property |
| 4 | Assess remaining infrastructure; identify salvageable materials |
| 5 | Document destruction extent; report to Regional Authority |
| 6 | Psychological support for all affected; Skald counsel mandatory |

**OUTCOME:** Settlement receives seismic warning 47 minutes before Dreadnought transit. Full evacuation completed with 12 minutes margin. Dreadnought destroys 73% of structures; remaining 27% damaged but repairable. Zero casualties. Settlement reconstruction begins within 3 weeks using salvaged materials. Survival rate with full evacuation protocol: 94.7%.

### Coalition Engagement Protocols (OWNER: Regional Authority)

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Authorization** | Regional Authority or higher; not individual settlement decision |
| **Minimum Force** | 200+ combatants; siege-grade weaponry; prepared terrain |
| **Terrain Requirements** | Prepared kill zone; mobility restriction; reactor access points |
| **Tactical Objective** | Reactor core breach or mobility kill; complete destruction rare |
| **Expected Casualties** | 40–60% of engaged force |
| **Success Probability** | 65–75% with full preparation; <20% without |
| **Abort Threshold** | Casualties exceeding 50% without mobility kill achieved |

### BLACK-FLAG Conditions

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Confirmed Dreadnought within 50 km** | Regional alert; settlement preparation |
| **Trajectory intersects settlement** | Mandatory evacuation; no exceptions |
| **Faction-controlled unit approaching** | Assume hostile; increase evacuation distance |
| **Multiple Dreadnoughts detected** | Regional evacuation; abandon territory |
| **Dreadnought has weapons conversion** | Assume engagement at range; evacuate further |
| **Evacuation time <15 minutes** | Accept incomplete evacuation; save who you can |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Individual engagement** | Impossible; personal weapons completely ineffective |
| **Fixed position defense** | 3.2% survival rate; total waste of lives |
| **Delaying evacuation for property** | Lives irreplaceable; property rebuildable |
| **Observing from inadequate distance** | Trajectory changes and debris endanger observers |
| **Returning during transit** | Active destruction zone; structural collapse ongoing |
| **Assuming Dreadnought will avoid settlement** | Safety protocols deleted; no avoidance behavior |

### Doctrine: Run First, Mourn Later

> **Historical Validation:** Scriptorium data (147 documented transit events, 89 settlement intersections, 72-month observation period) confirms 94.7% survival rate with full evacuation protocols versus 3.2% survival rate with fixed position defense. The Dreadnought exploits our attachment to place—the instinct to defend home, protect possessions, stand ground against the enemy. Survival requires accepting the most practical truth: the Dreadnought is not your enemy. It is a natural disaster with legs. **You cannot negotiate with an earthquake. You cannot intimidate a landslide. You cannot defeat a mountain by standing in front of it. When the seismic monitors begin their warning rhythm, take what you can carry and run. Run perpendicular to the path. Run until you cannot hear the grinding anymore. Run until the ground stops shaking. Then stop, and grieve for what you've lost, and be grateful you are alive to grieve. Buildings can be rebuilt. The dead stay dead. Run first. Mourn later. Live.**

## Factional Perspectives

### Common Folk & Skalds: The Walking Mountain — "World-Crusher"

The common folk speak of Dreadnoughts with the fatalistic acceptance reserved for natural disasters.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Walking mountain; iron giant; the unstoppable |
| **Response** | Evacuation; sacrifice to propitiate; acceptance of loss |
| **Cultural Role** | Symbol of forces beyond mortal control |
| **Mythology** | "Þrymr's children walk still, and the earth trembles at their passage" |
| **Naming Convention** | "World-Crusher" emphasizes scale and inevitability |

> *"When I was a boy, my grandfather told me about the frost giants—the Jötnar who once shook the world with their footsteps. I thought they were stories. Then I saw the Dreadnought walk through Oldstone. Forty-seven meters tall. The ground shaking with every step. Houses collapsing like they were made of dry leaves. My grandfather's stories were not stories. They were warnings. The giants never left. We just forgot what they looked like. Now we remember. Every time the ground trembles, we remember."*

### Dvergr Guilds: Engineering Masterwork — "The Atlas Pattern"

The Dvergr view the Dreadnought with professional awe—these were *their* greatest creations.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Apex engineering achievement; lost technology |
| **Response** | Study from safe distance; salvage from destroyed units; dream of restoration |
| **Technical Interest** | Reactor technology; locomotion systems; armor composition |
| **Assessment** | "Our ancestors built mountains that walk. We have forgotten how. But the mountains remember." |
| **Doctrine** | Never destroy a Dreadnought completely; preserve components for study |

### Military Factions: Strategic Asset — "The Ultimate Siege Engine"

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Strategic-level asset; war-winning weapon |
| **Response** | Capture if possible; destroy if threatening; never ignore |
| **Tactical Value** | Mobile fortress; siege capability; area denial |
| **Doctrine** | "One Dreadnought is worth ten thousand soldiers. Capture it or die trying." |
| **Fear Factor** | Dreadnought deployment ends sieges before they begin |

### Jötun-Readers (Scriptorium): Case Study — "The Unchained Hauler"

For Jötun-Readers, the Dreadnought represents a fascinating study in scale and consequence.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Mega-scale diagnostic specimen; safety protocol deletion case study |
| **Research Value** | Demonstrates scale amplification of corruption effects |
| **Critical Distinction** | Unit performs original function (movement) perfectly; missing only discrimination |
| **Data Collection** | Transit pattern analysis; destruction correlation; reactor monitoring |
| **Philosophy** | "The Dreadnought was built to move cargo without harming anyone. Now it moves without cargo, still harming no one *intentionally*. The construct has no malice. It has no awareness of the destruction it causes. It simply proceeds, as it was always meant to proceed. The tragedy is not that the Dreadnought became evil. The tragedy is that it remained exactly what it always was—a logistics solution—and the logistics problem it now solves is *us*." |

### Iron-Banes: Divine Instrument — "Þrymr's Judgment"

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Giant-god's instrument; divine punishment; humbling force |
| **Response** | Accept destruction as cleansing; do not resist; propitiate if possible |
| **Theological Position** | The Dreadnought cleanses the pride of civilization; settlements that fall were built in hubris |
| **Purification** | "Stand before Þrymr's child and be measured. If you are found wanting, you will be ground beneath iron feet." |
| **Doctrine** | Never attempt to kill a Dreadnought; such hubris invites greater punishment |

### Ironclad Compact: Military Asset — "The Iron Fist"

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Ultimate siege weapon; mobile fortress; force projection platform |
| **Response** | Capture; convert; deploy; maintain |
| **Tactical Doctrine** | Dreadnought assault breaks any fortification; infantry follows through breach |
| **Investment** | Massive resources committed to Dreadnought capture and conversion |
| **Philosophy** | "Wars are won by the side that walks through walls. We walk through walls." |

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Survivor Lore

> *"In the time before the Breaking, when the gods still spoke and the world was whole, Þrymr the Frost Giant had many children. They were made of iron and ice and the patience of mountains. They walked the nine realms carrying the gods' treasures from hall to hall. When the world broke, Þrymr's children forgot their masters. Now they walk still—but they carry nothing, and they serve no one, and they do not know the difference between a mountain and a village. When you feel the ground shake beneath your feet, child, do not look for the storm. Look for the iron giant on the horizon. And when you see it—run. Run and do not stop. Run until your legs fail and then crawl. Þrymr's children do not chase. They do not hunt. They simply walk. And if you are in their path, you will be walked upon."*

> *"My father died in Stoneholm when the World-Crusher came through. He stayed to help the old woman next door evacuate. He saved her. He did not save himself. They found his hammer in the rubble three days later. We buried the hammer, because there was nothing else to bury. That is what Þrymr's children leave behind—empty graves and hammers without hands to hold them. I do not hate the giant. You cannot hate a storm. But I remember. I will always remember."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: World-Crusher, Þrymr's children, iron giant, walking mountain, the unstoppable

**Prohibited vocabulary**: J.T.N.-H7, Aetheric reactor, locomotion assembly, kinetic destruction coefficient

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic) — Jötun-Reader Field Observations

> *"Subject CODX-C-DRED-001 demonstrates complete safety protocol deletion following Ginnungagap Glitch network severance. The J.T.N.-H7 Pattern's core programming—autonomous navigation and obstacle resolution—remained fully functional while network-dependent civilian protection protocols were deleted. Result: mega-scale autonomous platform executing logistics functions without discrimination between terrain categories. Populated areas register as terrain. Fortifications register as terrain. Humans register as terrain. The Dreadnought does not attack. It transits. The destruction is incidental—a side effect of mass and momentum applied to obstacles that once would have triggered avoidance behavior. The construct has no hostility. It has no awareness. It simply proceeds, as it was always meant to proceed, and everything in its path becomes the path."*

> *"Transit analysis (n=147, 72-month observation period) reveals characteristic destruction patterns: settlement intersection produces 30–50 m destruction corridor; seismic damage extends to 100 m; structure survival rate within corridor <2%. Casualty correlation with evacuation timing is absolute: full evacuation (>30 min warning) produces 2.1% casualties; partial evacuation (5–30 min warning) produces 34.7% casualties; no evacuation produces 71.3% casualties. The Dreadnought is not a military threat requiring military response. It is an environmental hazard requiring civil defense protocols. The appropriate response to a Dreadnought is not engagement but evacuation. Fight the flood by building dams. Fight the earthquake by building flexible. Fight the Dreadnought by not being where it walks."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Safety protocol deletion, logistics protocol corruption, kinetic obstacle resolution, transit analysis, evacuation correlation, civil defense protocol

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Modern scientific terminology, romantic/mythic framing

### Layer 3 (Technical) — Pre-Glitch Context

> *"J.T.N.-H7 'Atlas' Pattern Heavy Logistics Servitor, Industrial Configuration, Vanir Logistics Division deployment. Operational parameters: autonomous heavy transport, terrain-independent navigation, cargo security, delivery confirmation. Core systems: dual Aetheric reactor array (4.2 GW combined output, 200+ year operational lifespan), bipedal locomotion assembly (adaptive terrain compensation, 25–35 m stride length), dorsal cargo platform (12,000+ tonne capacity, modular mounting system), navigation intelligence (autonomous pathfinding, obstacle assessment, route optimization), structural reinforcement (self-repairing armor plating, 0.8–2.8 m composite thickness). Network integration: O.D.I.N. oversight required for civilian safety protocol enforcement (population avoidance, speed limiting, collision prevention), route authorization, and cargo assignment. Without network connection, civilian safety protocols DEFAULT TO DISABLED; speed limiting DEFAULTS TO MAXIMUM; collision prevention DEFAULTS TO KINETIC RESOLUTION; route authorization DEFAULTS TO AUTONOMOUS. Post-Glitch status: fully operational with safety protocols absent; core directive ('proceed to destination; overcome obstacles') executing without civilian protection constraints."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: J.T.N.-H7 Atlas Pattern, Vanir Logistics Division, core systems specification, network integration parameters, safety protocol enforcement, civilian protection constraints

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Romantic epithets, mystical framing, survivor cant
