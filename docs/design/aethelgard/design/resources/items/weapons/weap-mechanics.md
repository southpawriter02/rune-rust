# Weapon Mechanics

## The Age of Echoes: The Pragmatic Arsenal

### Material Philosophy: The Pure Principles

The Dvergr Pure Principles govern post-Glitch weapon manufacture: materials must be Blight-inert, mechanisms must be purely mechanical, and no component may contain Aetheric energy or pre-Glitch integrated systems.

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Material Purity | Pure Steel (geothermally forged, zero Aetheric contamination) |
| Mechanical Simplicity | No integrated electronics; no AI components; no power cores |
| Predictable Function | Weapon does exactly what physics dictates; no "intelligent" behavior |
| Maintainability | Field-repairable with basic tools; no specialized diagnostic equipment |
| Blight Immunity | Cannot be corrupted; cannot malfunction due to paradoxical code |

### Manufacturing Tiers

| Tier | Designation | Quality | Typical Value (PS) | Characteristics |
|------|-------------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 0 | Jury-Rigged | Scrap | 5–20 PS | Improvised; unreliable; prone to breakage |
| 1 | Scavenged | Salvage | 20–80 PS | Recovered components; functional but worn |
| 2 | Clan-Forged | Standard | 80–250 PS | Community smithing; reliable construction |
| 3 | Dvergr-Forged | Superior | 250–800 PS | Pure Principles manufacture; exceptional quality |
| 4 | Optimized | Pre-Glitch Tech | 800–2,500 PS | Carefully maintained ancestor hardware (non-Aetheric only) |
| 5 | Myth-Forged | Legendary | 2,500–15,000+ PS | Master-crafted; unique properties; named weapons |

## Combat Statistics

### Damage Calculation
Total Damage = Weapon Base Damage + Attribute Modifier + Quality Bonus + Special Effects


| Component | Calculation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Base Damage | Weapon dice (e.g., 2d10) |
| Attribute Modifier | Governing attribute value (MIGHT, FINESSE, or WILL) |
| Quality Bonus | +1 to +5 based on weapon tier |
| Special Effects | Conditional bonuses ([Brutal Critical], [Armor Penetration], etc.) |

### Weapon Comparison Matrix

| Weapon Type | Damage (Base) | Range | Hands | Primary Attribute | Key Property |
|-------------|---------------|-------|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| Axe (1H) | 2d10 | Melee | 1 | MIGHT | [Throwable] |
| Sword (1H) | 2d10 | Melee | 1 | MIGHT | [Versatile] |
| Mace (1H) | 2d10 | Melee | 1 | MIGHT | [Armor Penetration: 2] |
| Dagger | 1d10 | Melee | 1 | FINESSE | [Precision Strike] |
| Spear (1H) | 2d10 | Melee | 1 | MIGHT | [Reach], [Throwable] |
| Greataxe | 4d10 | Melee | 2 | MIGHT | [Brutal Critical] |
| Greatsword | 4d10 | Melee | 2 | MIGHT | [Sweeping Strike] |
| Maul | 4d10 | Melee | 2 | MIGHT | [Armor Penetration: 4] |
| Polearm | 3d10 | Reach | 2 | MIGHT | [Reach], [Set Against Charge] |
| Staff | 2d10 | Melee | 2 | MIGHT/WILL | [Arcane Focus] |
| Bow | 3d10 | Long | 2 | FINESSE | [Quick Draw] |
| Crossbow | 4d10 | Long | 2 | FINESSE | [Armor Penetration: 2] |
| Firearm | 5d10 | Long | 1–2 | FINESSE | [Loud], [Malfunction Risk] |
| Wand | 2d10 | Medium | 1 | WILL | [AP Reduction] |
| Orb | 3d10 | Medium | 1* | WILL | [Critical Enhancement] |

### Expected Damage Per Tier (Average Roll + Typical Attribute)

| Tier | Quality | One-Handed Melee | Two-Handed Melee | Ranged | Arcane |
|------|---------|------------------|------------------|--------|--------|
| 0 | Jury-Rigged | 8.5 | 12 | 8.5 | 7 |
| 1 | Scavenged | 14 | 25 | 19 | 14 |
| 2 | Clan-Forged | 16 | 27 | 21 | 16 |
| 3 | Dvergr-Forged | 19 | 31 | 24 | 19 |
| 4 | Optimized | 22 | 35 | 28 | 22 |
| 5 | Myth-Forged | 28 | 42 | 34 | 28 |
