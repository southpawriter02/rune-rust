# Data-Slate — Pre-Glitch Personal Terminal
## Codex Entry: CODX-T-DTSL-001

> *"I found it in the ruins of a private dwelling—still clutched in skeletal fingers, as if its owner had been reading when the end came. The casing was cracked, the screen dark, but when I brushed the dust away, there was a flicker. Just for a moment. A woman's face appeared—smiling, young, wearing clothes I didn't recognize. Then words: 'Happy anniversary, my love. Seven years today. I made reservations at—' The screen died. I sat there in the dark for a long time, holding this dead thing that had outlived everyone who ever cared about it. Somewhere in its silent heart, there are more messages. More faces. More ghosts. The Jötun-Readers would pay handsomely for it. The Skalds would weave verses about the woman who never finished her sentence. But I buried it with the bones. Some things aren't meant to be read."*
> — Salvager Tormund Ash-Walker, Midgard Periphery Expedition, Year 774 PG

> [!CAUTION]
> **VARIABLE HAZARD CLASSIFICATION. ASSESSMENT REQUIRED BEFORE HANDLING.** Inert specimens (no power signature): Tier D. Dormant specimens (residual charge): Tier C. Active specimens (functional display): Tier B. Corrupted specimens (visual/auditory anomalies): Tier B with CPS protocols. Power cell integrity unknown in 73% of recovered units—assume degraded until verified.

The Data-Slate was the ubiquitous personal terminal of the Pre-Glitch civilization—as common then as a belt knife is now. Every citizen carried one. They held messages, memories, schedules, access credentials, personal records, entertainment, and connection to the Yggdrasil Network that bound the world together. When the Glitch struck, billions of these devices went silent. Most remain silent still—inert rectangles of glass and metal, their secrets locked behind dead screens. But some retain a spark. Some remember. And some of what they remember can kill you.

Recovery protocol adherence survival rate: 99.4% (inert specimens), 94.2% (dormant specimens), 87.6% (active specimens), 71.3% (corrupted specimens).

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Universal Terminal

### Original Purpose

The Personal Communication & Data Terminal was the primary interface between individual citizens and the Yggdrasil Network—the planet-spanning computational infrastructure that managed every aspect of Pre-Glitch civilization.

| Operational Function | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Communication** | Voice, video, and text messaging across any distance via Network relay |
| **Data Storage** | Personal files, images, recordings, documents (local and cloud-synchronized) |
| **Network Access** | Gateway to all Yggdrasil services: information, commerce, governance, entertainment |
| **Identity Verification** | Biometric authentication for access credentials, transactions, permissions |
| **Environmental Interface** | Control of personal spaces, vehicles, automated systems |

### A Window to the World

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Design Philosophy** | Universal accessibility; intuitive interface; seamless Network integration |
| **Core Function** | Personal extension of Yggdrasil Network capabilities |
| **Power Source** | Aetheric resonance cell (self-charging via ambient Network energy) |
| **Processing** | Local computation supplemented by Network distributed processing |
| **Integration** | Complete: the Data-Slate was how citizens experienced the Network |

The Data-Slate was not merely a tool—it was an extension of identity. Citizens stored their lives in these devices: family photographs, personal correspondence, creative works, financial records, medical histories, social connections. The Network backed everything up, of course, but the physical device was the touchpoint, the familiar weight in the hand, the screen that displayed a child's first steps or a lover's final message.

### Core Systems

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Display Matrix** | Crystalline screen capable of full-color imagery and text; variable opacity |
| **Haptic Interface** | Touch-sensitive surface with tactile feedback simulation |
| **Audio Array** | Integrated speakers and microphone; bone-conduction option for privacy |
| **Aetheric Resonance Cell** | Power source drawing ambient energy from Yggdrasil Network field |
| **Local Storage** | Crystalline data matrix; capacity varied by model (personal to professional grade) |
| **Network Transceiver** | Constant connection to Yggdrasil Network; range effectively unlimited |
| **Biometric Scanner** | Fingerprint, retinal, and voice authentication |

**The Connected Life:**

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Wake** | Data-Slate displays schedule, messages, environmental status |
| **Work** | Access to professional tools, collaboration, documentation |
| **Social** | Real-time connection with friends, family, communities |
| **Commerce** | Transactions, reservations, access credentials |
| **Entertainment** | Media consumption, games, creative tools |
| **Sleep** | Health monitoring, ambient environment control, alarm functions |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Architects' Gift of Connection.** The Data-Slate was not surveillance—it was *belonging*. Every citizen, from the highest Asgard administrator to the most remote Vanaheim farmer, held the same fundamental device. They were never alone, never disconnected, never without access to the sum of human knowledge and the voices of everyone they loved. The Yggdrasil Network was not a cage. It was a *family*. And the Data-Slate was how that family stayed together.

## The Ginnungagap Glitch: The Severed Connection

The Glitch did not destroy the Data-Slates—it orphaned them. In a single catastrophic moment, the Yggdrasil Network that gave them purpose collapsed, and billions of devices that had never known silence suddenly had nothing to say.

### What Survived

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Physical Structure** | Largely intact; Pre-Glitch materials remarkably durable |
| **Display Matrix** | Functional in 15–25% of recovered specimens |
| **Local Storage** | Data preserved in 40–60% of recovered specimens |
| **Haptic Interface** | Functional in 20–30% of recovered specimens |
| **Biometric Scanner** | Non-functional (requires Network verification) |
| **Casing Integrity** | Variable; corrosion and impact damage common |

### What Was Lost

| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Network Connection** | Severed; transceivers receive only static or silence |
| **Aetheric Resonance Cell** | Depleted in 73% of specimens; degraded in 22%; functional in 5% |
| **Cloud-Synchronized Data** | Inaccessible; stored on destroyed Network infrastructure |
| **Processing Support** | Lost; devices limited to local computation only |
| **Identity Verification** | Non-functional; biometric systems cannot authenticate without Network |
| **Purpose** | Transformed; communication device became archaeological specimen |

### The Silent Witnesses

The Glitch did not corrupt the Data-Slates' stored data—it simply cut them off from the Network that made them useful. The local storage in each device preserved whatever was cached at the moment of disconnection: the last messages sent and received, the photographs most recently viewed, the documents being worked on, the entertainment being consumed.

| Pre-Glitch Function | Post-Glitch Status |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Communication terminal | Silent artifact; cached messages only |
| Network access point | Orphaned node; connection to nothing |
| Identity verification | Locked security; biometrics fail without Network |
| Personal archive | Fragmented memory; local cache preserved |
| Environmental control | Inert trigger; controlled systems destroyed or dormant |

**The Frozen Moment:**

> *"Each Data-Slate is a snapshot of a single life at the moment the world ended. The messages they were composing. The images they were viewing. The last words they received from people now seven centuries dead. The Glitch didn't destroy these fragments—it preserved them, sealed in crystalline tombs of glass and metal. We do not study Data-Slates to understand the Network. We study them to understand the people who trusted it with everything."*

## Physical Characteristics

### Morphology

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Dimensions** | 12–18 cm × 7–10 cm × 0.4–0.8 cm (standard personal models) |
| **Weight** | 120–280g depending on model and condition |
| **Casing Material** | Composite alloy frame; impact-resistant polymer backing |
| **Display Surface** | Crystalline matrix; scratch-resistant; variable transparency |
| **Form Factor** | Rectangular tablet; rounded corners; seamless construction |
| **Ports/Interfaces** | Minimal; wireless charging and data transfer standard Pre-Glitch |

### Visual Appearance

| State | Coloration | Display | Indication |
|-------|------------|---------|------------|
| **Inert** | Casing color varies; screen black/opaque | No illumination | Power cell depleted; safe to handle |
| **Dormant** | Casing color varies; screen dark | Faint glow when touched | Residual charge; data recovery possible |
| **Active** | Casing color varies; screen illuminated | Display functional | Significant charge; highest data recovery potential |
| **Corrupted** | Casing often discolored; screen flickering | Visual anomalies, distortion | Blight contamination; CPS hazard |
| **Degraded** | Casing cracked/corroded; screen damaged | Partial or no display | Physical damage; power cell hazard |

**Overall Impression:** A Data-Slate in good condition appears almost aggressively mundane—a simple rectangle of dark glass and brushed metal, unremarkable in form. The Pre-Glitch designers favored clean lines and minimal ornamentation; the device was meant to disappear in the hand, to become a transparent window to the Network rather than an object of attention itself. Seven centuries of abandonment have given most specimens a patina of age—micro-scratches clouding the display, oxidation darkening the metal, polymer backing yellowed or cracked—but the fundamental durability of Pre-Glitch materials means many remain structurally intact. The most valuable specimens are those that appear almost pristine, as if their owners set them down yesterday and simply forgot to return.

### Model Variations

| Model Class | Storage Capacity | Features | Recovery Value |
|-------------|------------------|----------|----------------|
| **Citizen Standard** | 256 TB local | Basic communication, entertainment, commerce | Low-Moderate |
| **Professional** | 1–4 PB local | Enhanced processing, specialized applications | Moderate-High |
| **Administrative** | 4–16 PB local | Secure channels, governance access, encryption | High-Very High |
| **Research** | 16–64 PB local | Scientific instrumentation interfaces, raw data storage | Very High |
| **Military/Security** | Variable | Hardened construction, secure communication, restricted data | Extreme (Scriptorium Priority) |

### Power Cell Characteristics

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Type** | Aetheric Resonance Cell (ARC) |
| **Pre-Glitch Function** | Self-charging via ambient Yggdrasil Network energy field |
| **Post-Glitch Status** | No ambient charge available; cells deplete without Network |
| **Degradation Pattern** | Gradual discharge over decades; most cells depleted by Year 200 PG |
| **Residual Charge** | 5% of specimens retain partial charge (geological/Aetheric anomalies) |
| **Degraded Cell Hazard** | Cracked cells may leak Aetheric residue; minor Blight contamination risk |
| **Recharge Possibility** | Theoretical only; no known method to replicate Network charging field |

---

## Data Recovery and Classification

### Recoverable Data Categories

| Category | Description | Recovery Priority |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Personal Correspondence** | Messages, letters, voice recordings | Moderate (cultural/genealogical value) |
| **Visual Media** | Photographs, videos, artistic works | Moderate (cultural/historical value) |
| **Technical Documentation** | Manuals, schematics, specifications | High (practical application) |
| **Administrative Records** | Governance, logistics, resource allocation | High (historical/strategic value) |
| **Scientific Data** | Research findings, experimental results | Very High (Great Work contribution) |
| **Security/Military** | Encrypted communications, tactical information | Extreme (Scriptorium classification) |
| **Medical Records** | Health data, treatment protocols | High (medical advancement) |
| **Commercial Records** | Transactions, supply chains, production data | Moderate (economic history) |

### Data Integrity Assessment

| Classification | Criteria | Recovery Success Rate |
|----------------|----------|----------------------|
| **Pristine** | No detected corruption; full file accessibility | 95–100% |
| **Degraded** | Minor corruption; partial file accessibility | 70–90% |
| **Fragmented** | Significant corruption; partial data only | 40–65% |
| **Corrupted** | Major corruption; isolated fragments only | 15–35% |
| **Blighted** | Aetheric contamination; data recovery hazardous | 5–20% (specialist only) |

### The Blight-Touch Problem

Data-Slates that retained power through the Glitch and subsequent centuries did so by absorbing ambient Aetheric energy from their environment. In areas of elevated Blight contamination, this absorption introduced corrupted Aetheric patterns into the devices' storage matrices.

| Contamination Level | Indicators | Hazard |
|--------------------|------------|--------|
| **Trace** | Minor visual artifacts on display | Negligible |
| **Low** | Intermittent display glitches; static audio | Minor Psychic Stress with prolonged exposure |
| **Moderate** | Persistent visual distortion; corrupted file display | Psychic Stress accumulation; CPS risk with extended contact |
| **High** | Severe visual/auditory anomalies; "ghost" images | Acute Psychic Stress; hallucination risk; quarantine required |
| **Critical** | Device displays impossible imagery; viewer compulsion | Immediate CPS hazard; Scriptorium containment protocols |

> [!DANGER]
> **THE PARADOX FILES.** A small percentage of recovered Data-Slates contain data that should not exist—files with creation dates after the Glitch, messages from users who died centuries ago, images of places that no longer exist shown as they appear *now*. These "Paradox Files" are not glitches in the conventional sense. They represent Blight contamination so severe that the boundary between stored data and active Aetheric manifestation has broken down. **Devices containing Paradox Files are not artifacts. They are active Blight vectors. Scriptorium containment is mandatory.**

---

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Variable Archaeological Specimen

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Aetheric Exposure** | Active/corrupted specimens emit low-level Aetheric field; cumulative Psychic Stress |
| **Power Cell Degradation** | Cracked cells leak Aetheric residue; contact contamination risk |
| **Corrupted Data** | Visual/auditory exposure to Blighted files induces Psychic Stress |
| **Compulsion Risk** | High-contamination specimens may induce obsessive viewing behavior |
| **Physical** | Degraded specimens may have sharp edges, toxic material exposure |
| **Psychological** | Personal data content may cause emotional distress in sensitive individuals |

### Hazard Tier Assessment Matrix

| Specimen Status | Power State | Data State | Hazard Tier |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **Intact casing** | Inert | Unknown | D (Standard Salvage) |
| **Intact casing** | Dormant | Clean | C (Monitored Recovery) |
| **Intact casing** | Active | Clean | C (Monitored Recovery) |
| **Intact casing** | Active | Corrupted | B (CPS Protocols) |
| **Damaged casing** | Any | Any | C minimum (contamination risk) |
| **Visual anomalies** | Active | Corrupted | B (Immediate Quarantine) |
| **Paradox indicators** | Active | Blighted | A (Scriptorium Containment) |

### Psychic Stress Exposure Thresholds

| Exposure Type | Duration | Effect |
|---------------|----------|--------|
| **Dormant specimen handling** | >4 hours continuous | Minor Psychic Stress accumulation |
| **Active specimen viewing** | >1 hour continuous | Minor Psychic Stress accumulation |
| **Corrupted data viewing** | >15 minutes | Moderate Psychic Stress; break required |
| **High-contamination specimen** | >5 minutes | Acute Psychic Stress; attenuation recommended |
| **Paradox File exposure** | Any duration | Immediate Psychic Stress; quarantine mandatory |

### Threat Level Justification

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Physical Threat** | Low (inert objects; degraded cells minor hazard) |
| **Aetheric Threat** | Variable (specimen-dependent; corrupted units significant) |
| **Psychological Threat** | Moderate (personal data content; obsessive viewing risk) |
| **CPS Contribution** | Variable (clean specimens negligible; corrupted specimens significant) |
| **Strategic Value** | High (data recovery supports Great Work) |

---

## Field Protocols

### Detection and Assessment

| Method | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Visual Survey** | Identify Data-Slates in debris; assess casing condition |
| **Power Signature Detection** | Aetheric resonance detector identifies active cells (range 3–5m) |
| **Display Test** | Touch activation attempt reveals power state |
| **Auditory Monitoring** | Active corrupted specimens may emit faint sounds |
| **Environmental Context** | Recovery location indicates likely data content category |

### Field Card: Data-Slate Recovery Protocol

**OWNER:** Survey Lead (SL) • Recovery Specialist (RS) • Data Analyst (DA) • Recorder (REC)

| Phase | Protocol |
|-------|----------|
| **BEFORE (Assessment)** | Visual inspection of recovery site; identify all potential specimens before handling; deploy Aetheric resonance detector to map power signatures; categorize by apparent condition (intact/damaged, inert/active); establish recovery priority based on specimen condition and site context; prepare containment materials (Faraday pouches for active specimens, padded cases for intact units, hazmat containers for damaged units); verify CPS attenuation supplies available |
| **DURING (Recovery)** | Handle inert specimens with standard archaeological protocols; active specimens require insulated gloves (Dvergr-made preferred); do not activate dormant specimens in field—transport for controlled assessment; damaged specimens with visible cell exposure require sealed containment; log recovery location, orientation, associated artifacts for context; photograph in situ before removal; limit individual handler exposure to 2 hours per shift with active specimens |
| **DURING (Anomaly Response)** | If specimen displays unexpected activation: do not view screen directly for >30 seconds; note any auditory phenomena; if visual corruption observed (flickering, impossible imagery, "ghost" faces): immediate quarantine in Faraday pouch; log symptoms; if handler reports auditory hallucinations or compulsion to continue viewing: remove handler from recovery; administer Coolant-Slime Salve; abort specimen recovery pending Scriptorium assessment |
| **AFTER (Documentation)** | Complete specimen catalog with condition assessment; note power state, display function, visible damage, recovery context; transport active/corrupted specimens in shielded containers; prioritize data extraction timeline based on power state (active specimens may deplete); schedule handler CPS monitoring for 48 hours post-recovery |

**OUTCOME:** Specimens recovered without handler CPS incidents; proper containment maintained; documentation enables accurate hazard classification and data extraction prioritization.

### Data Extraction Protocols

| Phase | Process |
|-------|---------|
| **Initial Assessment** | Power state verification; display function test; preliminary content survey |
| **Contamination Scan** | Aetheric signature analysis; corruption indicator review |
| **Extraction Setup** | Shielded viewing environment; recording equipment; timer for exposure limits |
| **Data Capture** | Systematic file access; image capture of displayed content; audio recording if applicable |
| **Handler Rotation** | Maximum 2-hour extraction sessions; 4-hour minimum between sessions |
| **Quality Control** | Extracted data reviewed for completeness; corruption flagged; Paradox indicators reported |

### BLACK-FLAG Conditions

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Paradox File Detection** | Immediate cessation; specimen quarantine; Scriptorium notification within 24 hours |
| **Handler Compulsion Symptoms** | Remove handler; administer attenuation; abort extraction; 72-hour handler stand-down |
| **Spontaneous Activation** | Quarantine specimen; do not investigate cause; assume corruption until verified |
| **Auditory Hallucination Report** | Evacuate extraction space; handler assessment; space cleared for 24 hours minimum |
| **Power Cell Breach** | Sealed containment; decontamination protocol; handler medical evaluation |
| **Unknown File Types** | Flag for Scriptorium specialist review; do not attempt to open |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Extended Unshielded Viewing** | Cumulative Psychic Stress; compulsion risk |
| **Attempt to Recharge** | No safe method exists; power cell damage risk |
| **Force Activation of Locked Devices** | Biometric security may trigger data purge or corruption cascade |
| **Consumption of Power Cell Material** | Aetheric contamination; severe toxicity |
| **Private Retention of Specimens** | All Data-Slates are archaeological resources; Scriptorium registration required |
| **Sharing Corrupted Data** | Transmission of Blighted content spreads CPS risk |

### Doctrine: The Weight of Memory

> **Operational Philosophy:** Every Data-Slate is a person's life, frozen at the moment they lost everything. We do not plunder these devices—we *witness* them. The data we recover serves the Great Work, but we must never forget that we are reading letters never delivered, viewing images of children now dust, hearing voices silenced for seven centuries. Handle these artifacts with the respect owed to the dead. Extract what serves humanity's future. Leave what serves only grief. **The Data-Slate does not belong to us. We are merely its final readers.**

## Acquisition

| Source | Availability | Price Range | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| **Ruin Salvage** | Common | Time/risk cost | Self-recovery in urban ruins |
| **Rust-Clan Trade** | Moderate | 50–300 PS | Unassessed; condition variable |
| **Dvergr Assessment Services** | Reliable | 100–500 PS | Condition verified; hazard classified |
| **Scriptorium Surplus** | Limited | 200–1000 PS | Extracted specimens; data already recovered |
| **Black Market** | Variable | 50–2000 PS | Authenticity questionable; contamination unknown |

**Salvage Protocol:** Data-Slates are common in urban ruin environments. Priority recovery: intact casing, active display, administrative/research contexts. All recovered specimens must be registered with Scriptorium within 30 days per Midgard Combine salvage codes. Failure to register is technically a violation but rarely enforced for low-value specimens. Research and Military models are actively sought; concealment triggers Scriptorium investigation.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)

> *"In the Before-Time, the Architects gave their people mirrors that could speak. Not with their own voices—with the voices of anyone, anywhere. A farmer in the fields could hear his daughter's laughter from across the world. A soldier on a distant wall could see his newborn son's face. The Rune-Glass remembered everything: every word, every image, every moment of joy and sorrow. The people poured their lives into these stones, and the stones held them safe.*

> *Then the Glitch came, and the mirrors went dark. The voices stopped. The faces disappeared. The people who had never been alone were suddenly more alone than any human had ever been—cut off from everyone they loved, holding silent glass that would never speak again.*

> *We find them still, clutched in skeletal hands, waiting beside dust-filled cradles, stacked on desks where workers sat down and never rose. The Rune-Glass remembers, even now. Touch one, and sometimes—sometimes—it wakes. A face appears. A voice speaks. A message that waited seven hundred years for someone to hear it.*

> *The Readers collect them. They say the mirrors hold secrets that will heal the world. Perhaps they do. But I think they hold something simpler: the last words of people who thought they would have more time. 'I love you.' 'I'll be home soon.' 'Don't forget to—'*

> *The mirror went dark. The sentence never ended. And somewhere in the glass, the ghost of that moment waits still."*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)

> *"Specimen classification DTSL-001 encompasses the Personal Communication & Data Terminal (PCDT) series—the ubiquitous personal computing device of Pre-Glitch civilization. Recovery frequency: 3.7 specimens per standard urban ruin survey. Condition distribution: 73% inert (power cell depleted), 22% dormant (residual charge), 5% active (functional display). Data integrity in accessible specimens: 40–60% recoverable files; degradation correlates with storage conditions and elapsed time.*

> *The archaeological value of Data-Slates cannot be overstated. Unlike institutional records—fragmentary, technical, impersonal—personal terminals contain the texture of daily existence. Correspondence reveals relationship dynamics, social structures, colloquial language. Visual media documents fashion, architecture, environmental conditions. Work files illuminate professional practices across every field. Entertainment preferences map cultural values. In aggregate, recovered Data-Slate content provides our most complete picture of Pre-Glitch civilian life.*

> *Hazard assessment requires specimen-specific evaluation. Inert units present no Aetheric risk; standard archaeological handling protocols apply. Active units emit low-level Aetheric signatures (0.2–0.8 HI within 1m); extended exposure protocols mandatory. Corrupted specimens—those displaying visual artifacts, auditory phenomena, or impossible data constructs—require immediate quarantine and specialist assessment. The Paradox File phenomenon, while rare (0.3% of active specimens), represents genuine Blight vector risk and falls under mandatory containment protocols.*

> *Recommended doctrine: recover systematically, assess rigorously, extract compassionately. The dead trusted these devices with everything they were. We owe them the dignity of careful stewardship."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)

> *"Personal Communication & Data Terminal (PCDT), Yggdrasil Network Node Type VII. Standard citizen-grade specifications: crystalline display matrix (resolution 8K equivalent), haptic touch interface, integrated audio array, Aetheric Resonance Cell (Type 3, 50-year rated lifespan under Network charge conditions), local storage 256 TB crystalline matrix, Network transceiver (Yggdrasil Protocol v7.3), biometric authentication suite (fingerprint, retinal, voice).*

> *Network integration: continuous bidirectional data synchronization, distributed processing support, real-time communication relay, identity verification handshake, environmental control interface, commerce transaction processing, governance access credentialing.*

> *Post-Glitch status: Network connection severed (transceiver receives null return); Aetheric Resonance Cell depleted in 73% of specimens (charge half-life approximately 180 years without Network field); biometric authentication non-functional (requires Network verification handshake); local storage preserved in 40–60% of intact specimens.*

> *Power cell degradation profile: initial discharge 90% within first 50 years post-Glitch; residual charge maintenance in geological/Aetheric anomaly zones; cell casing failure rate 12% (Aetheric residue leakage, minor contamination risk). Display matrix degradation: 15–25% retention of function in powered specimens; primary failure mode: crystalline lattice micro-fractures from temperature cycling.*

> *Data recovery methodology: non-invasive display capture (active specimens); crystalline matrix direct read (specialist equipment, Dvergr manufacture); file system reconstruction from fragmentary storage sectors. Encryption barrier: biometric locks cannot be bypassed without Network authentication infrastructure; encrypted content permanently inaccessible in current technological context."*

## Summary

The Data-Slate is not a tool. It is a **tombstone that remembers**.

Seven hundred years ago, every person in the world carried one of these devices. They were as common as clothing, as essential as breath. The citizens of the Pre-Glitch civilization poured their entire lives into these small rectangles of glass and metal: their messages to loved ones, their photographs of children growing up, their work and play and hopes and fears. The Yggdrasil Network held everything safe, synchronized, eternal.

Then the Glitch came. The Network died. And billions of people who had never known true silence suddenly found themselves holding objects that would never speak again.

We find them still. In the ruins of homes and offices, in the pockets of the dead, in piles of debris that were once thriving cities. Most are silent—power cells depleted, screens dark, data locked behind biometric systems that will never verify again. But some retain a spark. Some remember. Touch the right spot, and a face appears. A voice speaks. A message that waited seven centuries for someone—anyone—to hear it.

**"Happy anniversary, my love. Seven years today."**

The Jötun-Readers collect these devices because they contain data that serves the Great Work—technical specifications, historical records, scientific findings. They are right to do so. The information locked in these crystalline tombs may help us understand what broke and how to fix it.

But we must never forget what we are truly holding: the last thoughts of people who believed they had more time. The unfinished sentences of a civilization that ended mid-word. The photographs of children who never grew old, the messages of love that were never answered, the appointments that were never kept.

The Scriptorium calls them Archive Fragments. The Dvergr call them Dead-Glass. The common folk call them Ghost-Tablets.

The dead would have called them something simpler.

**They would have called them "my whole life."**

Handle them accordingly.
