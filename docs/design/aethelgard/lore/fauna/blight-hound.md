# Codex Entry: Blight-Hound (Svartr-Rakki)

> *Jötun-Reader Field Notation: The following entry synthesizes five evidence fragments recovered between 779-783 PG. Unlock thresholds defined per Bestiary protocol. Handle with appropriate caution—specimen proximity triggers have been documented.*

---

## 1.0 Overview

The **Blight-Hound**—known in common parlance as the *Ash-Stalker* and in Old Tongue as *Svartr-Rakki* ("Black Dog")—represents one of the more unsettling examples of fauna transformed by prolonged Runic Blight exposure. Originally descended from Pre-Glitch service canines employed in Aesir mining operations, these creatures have undergone catastrophic physiological and behavioral corruption over seven centuries of environmental saturation.

Unlike purely mechanical threats, the Blight-Hound retains organic components—muscle, bone, sensory organs—interwoven with crystallized Blight formations that have replaced portions of its skeletal structure and nervous system. The result is neither machine nor beast, but a third category the Scriptorium has designated **"Blight-Forged Fauna."**

---

## 2.0 Physical Characteristics

Field observations describe a quadrupedal predator of considerable mass, standing approximately chest-height to an adult human. Distinguishing features include:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Crystalline Ossification** | Runic Blight has replaced significant portions of the cranium, spine, and forelimbs with semi-translucent crystalline growths that pulse with residual Aetheric charge. |
| **Sensory Degradation** | Optical organs have atrophied; hunting relies primarily on vibration detection through ground-contact pads and Aetheric resonance sensing. |
| **Ash-Venting** | Respiration expels fine particulate matter—hence the "Ash-Stalker" designation. This exhalation carries trace Blight contamination. |

---

## 3.0 Behavioral Profile

Blight-Hounds exhibit corrupted pack behavior, forming loose aggregations around concentrated Blight sources. They do not hunt for sustenance in any traditional sense—their metabolic processes appear to draw energy directly from ambient Aetheric radiation. Instead, they hunt *movement*, responding to vibration patterns that match Pre-Glitch threat signatures still embedded in their corrupted neural architecture.

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Trigger Behavior** | Rapid movement, metallic sounds, and Runic activation all provoke pursuit response. |
| **Pack Coordination** | Despite neural degradation, packs demonstrate rudimentary tactical behavior—flanking, herding prey toward hazardous terrain. |
| **Territorial Marking** | Crystalline deposits left at territorial boundaries exhibit mild informational hazard properties. |

---

## 4.0 Habitat & Distribution

Primarily encountered in Blight-saturated industrial ruins, abandoned mining complexes, and the contaminated periphery of the Knuckle-Bone Fields. Populations have been confirmed in:

- Midgard's northern wastes
- Svartalfheim's collapsed tunnel networks
- Niflheim's glacial Blight-zones

---

## 5.0 Strategic Assessment

The Blight-Hound represents a **moderate-to-high threat** for field operations. Individual specimens can be neutralized with conventional armaments, but pack encounters in enclosed spaces carry significant casualty risk.

**Rangers Guild Protocols:**
- Minimum three-person teams in confirmed territory
- Vibration discipline (soft boots, measured movement)
- Runic equipment shielded or deactivated during transit

## Unlock Thresholds — Bestiary Protocol

| Threshold | Reveals |
|-----------|---------|
| **25%** | Common name, general silhouette, habitat regions, "avoid rapid movement" warning |
| **50%** | Full physical description, pack behavior, territorial markers, basic countermeasures |
| **75%** | Sensory mechanics, Blight-Forged classification, metabolic anomaly, tactical coordination |
| **100%** | Origin species (Pre-Glitch service canines), corruption vector, specimen analysis, full strategic assessment |

---

> **Lead Researcher's Note:** *They don't eat you. That's the first thing the Rangers tell you. They don't need to. They hunt because something in their broken minds still remembers being told to protect the tunnels. And after seven hundred years, everything that moves looks like an intruder.*

| **Outcome** | Taxonomy updated; Blight-Hound designated Type Specimen |
| **Owner** | Division of Post-Glitch Ecology |

### Content (L2 Scholarly Voice)

> The specimen designated *Svartr-Rakki* presents a diagnostic paradox that our existing fauna taxonomies cannot accommodate. It is neither beast nor automaton, neither living nor purely mechanical. The Runic Blight has not merely corrupted this creature—it has *replaced* fundamental biological systems with crystalline analogues that maintain function through mechanisms we do not yet understand.
>
> I propose a new classification: **Blight-Forged Fauna**. This category encompasses organisms that have achieved stable integration with Blight crystallization while retaining sufficient organic tissue to qualify as "alive" by traditional metrics. The Blight-Hound serves as our Type Specimen.
>
> What troubles me is the implication. If the Blight can stabilize in organic hosts—can find equilibrium rather than terminal corruption—then we must ask: is this disease, or adaptation? Is the Blight-Hound suffering, or thriving?
>
> — Researcher Valdis Hollowborn, Scriptorium-Primus

| **Owner** | Division of Post-Glitch Ecology |

### Content (L2/L3 Clinical Voice)

> **Subject:** Adult Blight-Hound, deceased (natural causes—Aetheric depletion)  
> **Recovery Site:** Knuckle-Bone Fields, Sector 7-Gamma  
> **Condition:** Moderate crystalline development; approximately 40% ossification
>
> **Findings:**
>
> 1. **Skeletal Integration:** Runic Blight crystallization has replaced portions of the cranium, cervical vertebrae, and forelimb bones. Crystal-bone interfaces show no rejection response—tissue has adapted to the intrusion.
>
> 2. **Neural Pathway Modification:** Crystalline filaments extend from spinal integration points into remaining organic brain tissue. These filaments appear to conduct Aetheric charge, suggesting the Blight has created an auxiliary nervous system.
>
> 3. **Sensory Apparatus:** Optical nerves have atrophied completely. Crystalline growths in the cranium respond to vibration and Aetheric fluctuation—the creature "sees" through resonance, not light.
>
> 4. **Metabolic Anomaly:** No digestive activity detected. Aetheric absorption through crystalline surfaces appears to sustain biological functions. Subject expired when removed from Blight-saturated environment.
>
> 5. **H-Index Assessment:** Crystalline deposits register 2.4 on the Hazard Index. Mild informational contamination risk from prolonged proximity. Standard handling protocols sufficient.

### Integration Notes

- Provides clinical anatomical data for Codex Section 2
- Documents metabolic dependency on Aetheric radiation
- Establishes H-Index rating for safety protocols
- Validates "Blight-Forged" classification through specimen evidence

>
> You want to know about the Ash-Stalkers? Sit down, pup. And listen.
>
> First thing—you don't run. You never run. They feel your feet hitting the ground before you've taken three steps. Vibrations, see? Those crystal bones of theirs, they drink up every tremor. You run, they know exactly where you're going.
>
> Second thing—they don't hunt alone. You see one, there's three more you don't see. They'll herd you. Push you toward the bad ground, the unstable floors, the places where the Blight runs thick. Then they wait. Patient as stone.
>
> Third thing—they don't eat you. Never seen one feed. They just... stop. Once you're down, once you're not moving anymore, they lose interest. Walk away like you were never there. That's the worst part, I think. They don't even want you. You're just... a thing that was moving wrong.
>
> My advice? Soft boots. Slow steps. And if you hear that wheezing—that ash-breath sound they make—you freeze. You become furniture. You become stone. And you pray to whatever dead god you still believe in that they walk right past.

### Integration Notes

- Provides L1 mythic/practical voice for behavioral section
- Documents pack tactics and hunting termination behavior
- Validates vibration-based detection (corroborates specimen analysis)
