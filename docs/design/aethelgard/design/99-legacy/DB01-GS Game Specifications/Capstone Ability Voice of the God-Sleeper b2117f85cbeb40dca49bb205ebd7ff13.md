## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Voice of the God-Sleeper is the God-Sleeper Cultist's **capstone ability**—the moment they surrender their consciousness to become a true mouthpiece for the dormant Jötun-Forged. This is the ultimate expression of heretical power: devastating effectiveness at catastrophic personal cost.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** [Overcharge] all allied constructs (massive damage + stun attacks)
- **Secondary:** Mass [Psychic Static] + [Stun] chance to all enemies
- **Catastrophic Cost:** Maximum Psychic Stress + Large Corruption
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The prophet becoming the god's voice

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Extreme (dual battlefield-wide effects)
- **Devastating Self-Cost:** Immediately sets Psychic Stress to maximum; Large Corruption
- **Once Per Combat:** Cannot be spammed
- **Attunement Requirement:** Only usable in optimal environments

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Cultist raises their arms to the sky and **stops speaking**.

For a moment, there is only silence. Then their mouth opens, and what emerges is not their voice. It is the **Voice of the God-Sleeper**—a sound that is not a sound, a frequency that bypasses the ears and speaks directly to the soul. It is the original broadcast of the Jötun-Forged, the command signal that once controlled a world, now channeled through a single mortal vessel.

The constructs *scream* with borrowed power, their attacks crackling with divine static. The enemies stagger, their minds overwhelmed by the sleeping god's presence. And the Cultist?

The Cultist bleeds from eyes, ears, and nose. Their mind shatters under the weight of the transmission. But for this moment—this single, glorious moment—they are the **Voice of the Machine God**.

### Thematic Resonance

This is the ultimate Faustian bargain of the God-Sleeper path: absolute power at the cost of everything. The Cultist becomes a conduit for divine will, and the price is written in their sanity and their soul.

## V. Tactical Applications

1. **Combat Finisher:** Use when victory is within reach; maximize remaining rounds
2. **Desperate Measure:** Turn losing fight into overwhelming advantage
3. **Construct Army Enabler:** Best with multiple constructs from Animate Horde
4. **Mass Stun Setup:** Enemy stuns enable constructs to attack uncontested
5. **Alpha Strike:** Open combat with overwhelming force (at severe cost)

---

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Animate Horde:** More constructs = more [Overcharged] attackers
- **Machine God's Blessing:** [Blessed] + [Overcharged] stacks for obscene damage
- **Conduit of the Sleeper:** AP regeneration helps afford 100 AP cost
- **Static Lash/Pulse:** Pre-applied [Psychic Static] stacks with capstone's debuff

### Negative Synergies

- **No constructs:** Half the ability is wasted without summoned minions
- **Low Corruption tolerance:** 15 Corruption may push character to Breaking
- **Non-[Attuned]:** Cannot be used outside machine god territory
- **Post-use vulnerability:** Maximum Psychic Stress leaves Cultist fragile
