### **I. Core Philosophy: The System Pathologist**

The **Jötun-Reader** is the Adept specialization that embodies the philosophy that the world's crash must be **observed and documented to be survived**. They are not warriors or mystics; they are **System Pathologists** and **field diagnosticians**. They approach the Runic Futhark and pre-crash technology as a dead patient on an autopsy table—something to be studied, catalogued, and understood, but not repaired. They are archaeologists of a lost age, documenting symptoms of a terminal collapse they lack the knowledge to cure.

Their power comes not from manipulating or recreating the Old World's technology, but from **reading its death throes**. They can translate runic inscriptions, identify structural weaknesses in corrupted systems, and speak fragments of command-line code—but these are forensic tools, not acts of creation. They are scribes of the apocalypse, and their greatest strength is knowing what killed the world.

To choose the Jötun-Reader is to embrace the fantasy of the ultimate scholar-adventurer and field pathologist. Your saga is written in the error logs you translate, the ancient failure states you document, and the critical anatomical weaknesses you expose in your foes. You are the quiet, indispensable intellect of the party, the one who can read the autopsy report of a dying world.

### **II. Player-Facing Presentation**

- **Role:** Tactical Analyst, System Debugger, Lore Master
- **Primary Attribute:** WITS (for analysis, perception, and deciphering complex code)
- **Secondary Attribute:** FINESSE (for interacting with delicate, ancient mechanisms)
- **Gameplay Feel:** The Jötun-Reader is a pure, dedicated non-combat support class. Their direct combat contribution is minimal, but their "damage" is done through the intelligence they provide. Playing a Jötun-Reader is a cerebral and methodical experience, rewarding players who are patient, observant, and enjoy solving complex puzzles. They are the party's force multiplier, making every other member more effective through the power of pure information. The Jötun-Reader excels in exploration and problem-solving phases, where their unique abilities unlock paths others cannot access.

### **III. Mechanical Implementation: The Art of the Debugger**

The Jötun-Reader's power is expressed through their mastery of information-gathering and puzzle-solving skills.

**A. Core Mechanic: Diagnostic Observation**

- **Feature:** The Jötun-Reader is the undisputed master of **observing and documenting** system failures and anatomical weaknesses.
- **Specification:** Their abilities are a superior, more potent version of the Adept's basic `Analyze` command. They don't "decompile source code"—they **read symptoms**. Like a pathologist performing an autopsy, they observe failure states, identify structural flaws, and document vulnerabilities with clinical precision.
- **Limitation:** They cannot **repair** or **recreate** what they study. Their power is purely observational and documentary.
- **Psychic Cost:** This direct observation of corrupted processes inflicts Psychic Stress—the price of staring into the crash.
- **Rationale:** Creates tactical "setup" gameplay through forensic observation rather than manipulation.

**B. Core Mechanic: Runic Translation**

- **Feature:** They are the only non-Mystic specialization with deep academic training in reading (but not casting) the Futhark.
- **Specification:** They **translate inscriptions** and **read command-line syntax** as a forensic linguist, not as a practitioner. They understand the grammar of reality's operating system, but they lack the knowledge to write new code or execute complex commands. They are readers of a dead language, not speakers.
- **Limitation:** Cannot use this knowledge to create runic effects, only to **read and understand** existing inscriptions and error logs.
- **Rationale:** Gates puzzle content behind specialization choice while maintaining the "pathologist" paradigm—they read the autopsy report, they don't perform surgery.

### **IV. The Skill Tree: The Analyst's Toolkit**

The Jötun-Reader's skill tree is focused on enhancing their analytical capabilities and their ability to interact with the Old World's broken code. Full ability specifications are available as sub-pages.

### **Tier 1 (Foundational Analysis)**

*Prerequisite: Unlock the Jötun-Reader Specialization (10 PP)*

- **Scholarly Acumen I** (Passive) - Bonus to System Bypass and investigation checks
- **Analyze Weakness** (Active) - Diagnostic observation revealing enemy Resistances/Vulnerabilities
- **Runic Linguistics** (Passive) - Translation of non-magical runic inscriptions

### **Tier 2 (Advanced Tactical Support)**

*Prerequisite: 8 PP spent in the Jötun-Reader tree*

- **Exploit Design Flaw** (Active) - Applies [Analyzed] debuff (+2 Accuracy for allies)
- **Navigational Bypass** (Active) - Grants party bonus to avoid/disarm traps
- **Structural Insight** (Passive) - Automatically detects unstable structures and cover

### **Tier 3 (Mastery of Lore)**

*Prerequisite: 20 PP spent in the Jötun-Reader tree*

- **Calculated Triage** (Passive) - +25% healing from consumables used near Jötun-Reader
- **The Unspoken Truth** (Active) - Knowledge-based attack inflicting [Disoriented]

### **Capstone (Ultimate Expression)**

*Prerequisite: 40 PP spent in the Jötun-Reader tree*

- **Architect of the Silence** (Active) - Speaks original command syntax to inflict [Seized] on Jötun-Forged/Undying

### **V. Systemic Integration**

**1. Core Role & Fantasy Fulfillment**

- The Jötun-Reader is the linchpin of high-level party strategy and the gatekeeper of the world's deepest secrets.
- Fantasy delivered: Scholar-adventurer, system debugger, keeper of forbidden knowledge.

**2. Trauma Economy Interaction**

- **High-Risk Specialization:** The Jötun-Reader is a primary example of the "price of knowledge."
- **Self-Inflicted Stress:** Their most powerful abilities (Analyze Weakness, Architect of the Silence) all inflict **Psychic Stress**.
- **Dependency:** A party with a Jötun-Reader absolutely needs a **Bone-Setter** or **Skald** to help manage this constant mental strain.
- **Thematic Coherence:** Knowledge of the crash is inherently traumatic. The Jötun-Reader pays for their insights with their sanity.

**3. Situational Power Profile**

- **Optimal Conditions:**
    - Boss fights and elite encounters (Analyze Weakness → Exploit Design Flaw combo is god-tier)
    - Puzzle-heavy dungeons (Runic Linguistics unlocks entire areas)
    - Facing Jötun-Forged or Undying (Architect of the Silence is a hard counter)
    - Trap-dense environments (Navigational Bypass, Structural Insight)
- **Weakness Conditions:**
    - Simple combat encounters against trash mobs (analysis overkill)
    - Environments with no puzzles or lore (abilities underutilized)
    - Facing purely organic beasts (Architect of the Silence useless)
- **Hard Counters:** Complex puzzles, Jötun-Forged/Undying enemies, trap-heavy dungeons
- **Hard Countered By:** Fast, simple encounters where setup time is wasted; anti-magic fields that disrupt System Bypass

**4. Synergies**

- **Positive Synergies:**
    - **High-accuracy attackers** (Hólmgangr, Vargr-Born, Rangers): Maximize value from [Analyzed] debuff (+2 Accuracy)
    - **Bone-Setter/Skald**: Essential for managing Jötun-Reader's self-inflicted Psychic Stress
    - **Tank Warriors** (Skjaldmær): Benefit from Calculated Triage healing boost
    - **Other Adepts** (Skald, Bone-Setter): All three form complete support triangle (information, morale, healing)
- **Negative Synergies:**
    - Low-accuracy, high-damage builds gain less from Accuracy buffs
    - Fast-paced combat-focused parties may not have time for analysis setup

**5. Archetype Fulfillment**

- **Archetype:** Adept
- **Sub-Role:** Pure Utility (Information/Puzzle-Solving), with secondary role as Controller (debuffer)
- **Adept Identity:** Non-magical, skill-based, cerebral, requires tactical patience and strategic thinking
