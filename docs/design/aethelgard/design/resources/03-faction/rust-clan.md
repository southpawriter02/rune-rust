# The Rust-Clans — Children of the Assembly Line

> *"I owe no man my survival, but I honor my crew."*
> — The Creed of the Self, morning affirmation of the Rust-Clans

---

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Classification** | Decentralized Salvage Confederation |
| **Common Names** | The Scrap-Folk, Children of the Great Looms, Creedless |
| **Core Philosophy** | The Creed of the Self: Radical Self-Reliance + Crew Loyalty |
| **Primary Territory** | Jötunheim Assembly Deck; Utgard (capital) |
| **Leadership Structure** | Rig-Master governance (meritocratic; earned, not inherited) |
| **Relationship to Blight** | Pragmatic exploitation; "Can I use this gear to fix my axle?" |

The Skalds of the soft, southern lands sing of the Rust-Clans as savage nomads—a feral people born from the dust of the factory-graveyards, their hands and hearts stained by the rust of their desolate home. They are portrayed as little more than bandits.

This view, born of fear and ignorance, fails to grasp the hard, pragmatic truth.

The Rust-Clans are not invaders of Jötunheim.

They are its true and only inheritors.

They are the children of the Great Looms, and their creed is the simple, unshakeable law of the salvage.

---

## Core Identity: The Creed of the Self

### The Foundational Philosophy

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **"I owe no man my survival"** | Every individual is responsible for their own existence. No entitlement to rescue, charity, or forgiveness. |
| **"But I honor my crew"** | The only exception to radical individualism. Crew members owe each other absolute loyalty. |
| **Contract Sanctity** | A signed contract is sacred—reputation is the only currency when no institutions guarantee behavior. |
| **Rejection of Grand Narratives** | All ideologies lead to oppression, violence, or failure. Focus on immediate survival. |

The Creed of the Self encapsulates the Rust-Clan worldview in twelve words. It is not a religion—it is an acknowledgment of environmental reality. In Jötunheim, incompetence kills everyone, and carrying dead weight endangers the entire crew.

> *"We have watched the Iron-Banes butcher heretics for using contaminated tools. We have watched the God-Sleepers sacrifice crews attempting to 'wake' obviously-dead machinery. We have watched the Dvergr exploit 'partners' through carefully-structured contracts. All grand narratives lead to oppression, violence, or failure. Better to focus on immediate survival than abstract ideals that promise everything and deliver nothing."*

### What Rust-Clans Believe

| Other Factions Say | Rust-Clans Know |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| "The machines are demons/gods" | "The machines are salvage" |
| "Faith will save us" | "Competence will save us" |
| "We must restore/destroy the old world" | "We must survive in this one" |
| "Loyalty to creed/bloodline/nation" | "Loyalty to crew—nothing else" |

---

## Origins: Children of the Assembly Line

### Pre-Glitch Lineage

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Social Position** | Lowest tier of Age of Forging workforce |
| **Occupation** | Human technicians, foremen, logistics crews |
| **Location** | Family housing integrated into Jötunheim factory infrastructure |
| **Expertise** | Practical machinery knowledge; no access to high-level schematics |

The ancestors of the Rust-Clans were not the Bunker-Born who hid from the end of the world. They were the ones who were **already inside it**. They were the descendants of low-level human technicians who lived and worked within the colossal, continent-spanning factories of the Jötunheim Assembly Deck.

When the Great Silence fell, they did not flee to shelters.

Their shelter was the factory itself.

### Survival During the Glitch

| Refuge | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Maintenance Tunnels** | Service corridors designed for industrial access |
| **Assembly Pit Depths** | Deep spaces beneath production lines |
| **Jötun-Forged Chassis Cavities** | Hollowed-out limbs of half-finished titans |
| **Service Pits** | Emergency shelters beneath assembly equipment |

They survived Ragnarok not by sealing a blast door, but by huddling in the very belly of the dead, metal gods. They weathered the Civil War of Glitches from within the battlefield itself—listening to god-machines tear themselves apart mere meters overhead.

This unique genesis forged profound psychological adaptations:

| Adaptation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| **Immunity to the Chorus** | Generational exposure to the Scream of Steel (Type Alpha CPS) grants partial resistance to psychic effects that drive outsiders mad within hours |
| **Intimate Machine Knowledge** | Learned industrial systems from the inside out—through survival necessity, not formal training |
| **Rejection of Authority** | Witnessed complete failure of Aesir oversight and AI governance; internalized that no external power will save you |

### The Age of Wandering: Emergence

Post-Glitch emergence occurred gradually over 20–50 years as survivor groups realized the Civil War had ended and the surface had become navigable.

| Challenge | Adaptation |
|-----------|------------|
| **Razor-sharp debris** | Learning to navigate Knuckle-Bone Fields |
| **Rust-Devils** | Developing protective measures against corrosive dust storms |
| **Rusting Lung** | Managing chronic respiratory disease |
| **Automata threats** | Mapping safe routes; identifying dormant vs. active zones |

Unlike unified factions that emerged from the Glitch with shared theology or ethnic identity, the Rust-Clans formed as **hundreds of independent survivor bands** with only geography in common. This fragmentation became defining cultural feature—no central authority, no unified creed, only pragmatic cooperation where mutually beneficial.

### The Birth of the Rig

The repurposing of Jötun-Haulers (pre-Glitch heavy transport vehicles) into mobile fortress-homes represented the pivotal technological adaptation that enabled Rust-Clan survival:

| Feature | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **Mobile Shelter** | Nomadic salvage operations without fixed bases |
| **Defensible Position** | Protection against automata and rival salvage bands |
| **Workshop** | On-site repairs and component processing |
| **Geothermal Core** | Continuous power without fuel supply chains |

The Rig became more than transportation—it became **homeland, identity, and family unit** compressed into 18 meters of armored steel.

---

## Society and Structure: The Rig

### The Mobile Fortress-Home

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| **Chassis** | Repurposed Jötun-Hauler (Age of Forging heavy transport) |
| **Dimensions** | 18m length × 8m width × 6m height |
| **Armor** | Scavenged Adamant-Weave plating (asymmetrical patchwork) |
| **Propulsion** | Geothermal power core (~20-year lifespan remaining typical) |
| **Armament** | 2 ballista turrets, reinforced ram prow, smoke dispensers |
| **Interior** | Living quarters, workshop bay, medical station, food/water storage |

### Rig as Identity

Rigs are not interchangeable vehicles—each develops unique personality through:

| Element | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| **True Names** | "The Grinder," "The Mirage," "Iron Testament"—becomes crew's identity |
| **Visual Signature** | Scrap-Plate patchwork creates distinctive recognition at distance |
| **Mechanical Quirks** | Years of repairs create unique sounds and handling crews learn intimately |
| **Clan Heraldry** | Mesh-bag weave patterns encode clan affiliation |

> *"To insult a Rust-Clanner's Rig—'That engine of yours sounds like a Gremlin choking on a handful of rust'—is declaration of war. The Rig is family member, and family honor demands defense."*

### Command Structure

| Rank | Authority |
|------|-----------|
| **Captain (Rig-Master)** | Absolute authority; route selection, contract negotiation, crew discipline |
| **Engineer** | Second-in-command; all mechanical systems, power core management |
| **Salvagers (6–8 crew)** | Front-line extraction; cutting specialists, heavy lifters, material graders |
| **Medic** | Field medicine, toxin treatment, Rusting Lung management |
| **Guards (3 typical)** | Perimeter security, turret operation, combat response |

**Captain Selection:** Captaincy is earned through crew vote or direct challenge if current Captain demonstrates incompetence. Succession protocols require resolution within 72 hours of Captain death to prevent Rig dissolution.

### The Law of the Claim

Outside Utgard's neutral ground, the only law is the Law of the Claim:

> *"A Clan's territory extends only to the ruin they are currently salvaging. To move in on another Clan's active claim is unambiguous declaration of war."*

| Claim Element | Requirement |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Establishment** | Physical presence at salvage site (Rig anchored within 200m) |
| **Activation** | Active extraction operations (cutting, loading, or assessment) |
| **Duration** | Until crew departs or 72 hours of inactivity |
| **Enforcement** | Violence—the Law provides no mechanism for peaceful resolution |

### Scrap-Wars

When claims conflict, violence frequently results:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Typical Engagement** | Ballista exchanges at 100–200m, followed by boarding actions |
| **Duration** | 20–90 minutes before one crew retreats or is destroyed |
| **Casualties** | 2–5 deaths per engagement typical (13% casualty rate documented) |
| **Post-Combat Custom** | Bodies returned to defeated crew; retreat honored once signaled |

Scrap-Wars represent the dark side of Rust-Clan radical individualism—when no higher authority exists to mediate disputes, violence becomes default arbitration mechanism.

---

## Utgard: The Hollow Giant

### The Lawless Capital

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Location** | Built within unfinished Aurgelmir-Designate Primeval Frame |
| **Population** | 10,000+ permanent; 3,000–8,000 transient |
| **Function** | Undisputed hub of planetary salvage trade |
| **Governance** | Scavenger Baron enforcement; Grey Desk arbitration |

Utgard evolved from temporary salvager camp to permanent trade hub through:

| Principle | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Neutral Ground** | Strict prohibition against violence within the Giant |
| **Arbitration Systems** | Grey Desk and Rope Courts resolve disputes without warfare |
| **External Trade** | Dvergr permanent delegation provides reliable market |
| **Sanctuary Status** | Refuge for apostates, heretics, and Creedless from all factions |

### District Structure

| District | Population | Function |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **The Gut** | 4,000–5,000 permanent; 8,000–12,000 peak transient | Great Market; trade hub |
| **The Rib-Cages** | 5,000–6,000 permanent | Residential; workshop tiers |
| **The Head** | 500–800 permanent | Scavenger Baron's district; elite merchants |

## Gutter-Cant: The Language Forged from Scrap

### The Language of Survival

Gutter-Cant is a "fast, sharp, efficient pidgin" devoid of pretense—perfectly suited to culture that values survival over poetry.

| Function | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Cultural Boundary** | Fluency marks you as Rust-Clan; outsiders immediately identifiable |
| **Spatial Metaphor** | Uses Utgard's anatomy as reference system |
| **Economic Vocabulary** | Sophisticated material grading terminology |

### Core Lexicon

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Scrap** | Lowest wealth; rusted plating, bent rebar (buys bowl of Grit-Porridge) |
| **Gleam** | High-quality salvage; pre-Glitch tech, valuable alloys ("The Real Currency") |
| **Shinies** | Derogatory: useless pretty objects like gold |
| **The Cog** | Dvergr currency; de facto high-value trade unit |
| **Warm-Vein** | Untouched ruin with valuable salvage |
| **Green-Horn** | Naive newcomer (common insult) |
| **Steel-true** | Trustworthy, reliable |
| **Rust-promise** | Worthless guarantee; liar |
| **The Claim** | Active salvage operation with territorial rights |
| **The Bodge** | Improvised repair (cultural virtue) |

### True-Names

Individuals are often known by "True-Names"—nicknames earned through skill, notable flaws, or memorable incidents:

| Name | Origin |
|------|--------|
| **Ash-Eye** | Exceptionally keen vision in dust storms |
| **Two-Fingers** | Lost three fingers to Scrap-Hydra |
| **The Mirage** | Expert at optical camouflage tactics |
| **Rust-Tongue** | Notorious contract-breaker (insult, not honor) |

True-Names replace birth names in crew contexts, reflecting principle that **identity is earned through action** rather than inherited through lineage.

### Insult Hierarchy

| Target | Severity |
|--------|----------|
| **The Man** | Personal character—common mockery, not serious offense |
| **The Skill** | Professional competence—challenges economic value and survival worthiness |
| **The Rig** | Mechanical condition or crew quality—**declaration of war** |

---

## Faith: Industrial Animism

### The Great Gear and the Rust-Curse

The Rust-Clans practice industrial animism that reinterprets pre-Glitch maintenance procedures as ritualized spirituality:

| Spirit | Manifestation |
|--------|---------------|
| **The Great Gear** | Spirit of Function—when an engine starts smoothly, when a gear turns without chatter, that is the Great Gear's blessing |
| **The Rust-Curse** | Spirit of Decay—the force that seizes pistons, dulls blades, causes failures. Rust is physical manifestation of this spirit's touch |

To a Rust-Clanner, cleaning rust is exorcism. Oiling a gear is prayer.

### Key Rituals (Functional Analysis)

| Ritual | Practice | Actual Function |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **The Tinkerer's Prayer** | Prick finger, anoint power core with blood before starting engine | Pause forces check for fluid leaks; blood on hot surfaces reveals thermal hotspots |
| **The Knock of Permission** | Knock three times with axe haft before entering sealed ruin | Sound propagation test for structural instability |
| **The First-Cog Offering** | When dismantling machine, leave first perfect gear on chassis | Creates standardized disassembly start point |
| **The Ghost's Share** | Pour portion of ale on floor before drinking | Liquid contact reveals hidden holes in deck plates |

The brilliance of industrial animism is that it **preserves effective maintenance practices** through generation-spanning cultural transmission even after underlying technical knowledge has been lost.

### Sagas of the Salvage

Rust-Clan heroes are not great warriors, but legendary scavengers:

| Saga Type | Celebration |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Vault Cracking** | "The Cracking of the Epsilon Vault" |
| **Heart-Harvests** | Successful extraction from dangerous automata |
| **Engineering Feats** | Keeping Rigs operational against impossible odds |
| **Legendary Finds** | Discovery of intact pre-Glitch technology |

A great feat of engineering or a legendary find grants immortality in their stories—not martial prowess.

## Technology: The Art of the Bodge

### Salvage Specializations

| Role | Expertise |
|------|-----------|
| **Crackers** | Non-destructive entry; bypassing ancient locks, mapping structural weaknesses |
| **Heart-Hunters** | Extracting Iron Hearts from dormant or hostile Undying (15–20% injury rate) |
| **Wire-Runners** | Navigating tangled power conduits and ventilation shafts for uncorrupted wiring |
| **Artificers** | Master mechanics who coax dead engines to life with scrap and ingenuity |

### Scrap-Runes and Gutter-Galdr

Rust-Clans utilize crude, pragmatic etchings on scrap metal—"Scrap-Runes"—representing "tinkerer's gamble" rather than formal runic practice:

| Rune | Effect | Risk |
|------|--------|------|
| **Spark-Rune** | Creates ignition spark (~60% success) | When it fails, nothing happens |
| **Husk-Rune** | Temporarily usurps Undying power; grants terrifying strength surge | Cost: temporary loss of free will—user becomes puppet to ghost-processes |

**Gutter-Galdr Philosophy:** Unlike formal Jötun-Reader scholarship or Iron-Bane theological purity, Gutter-Galdr makes no claims to theoretical understanding. It's purely empirical: "I scratched this pattern and sometimes it works."

| Faction Approach | Risk Tolerance |
|------------------|----------------|
| **Jötun-Readers** | Won't use rune unless they understand mechanism |
| **Iron-Banes** | Won't use rune unless theologically pure |
| **Rust-Clans** | Will use any rune if payoff exceeds risk |

This pragmatic approach occasionally yields innovations that more cautious factions miss—but also results in higher casualty rates from runic backfire.

### The Art of the Bodge

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Function Over Form** | Ugly repairs that work are superior to elegant failures |
| **Improvisation** | Use whatever materials are available |
| **Iteration** | Continuous refinement of bodged solutions |
| **Documentation** | Oral tradition preserves successful techniques |

Documented example: Artificer's bodge of drive train axle bearing using scrap components recovered 75% function at 36.5 Cogs cost versus 15,000+ Cogs replacement—keeping Rig operational for months.

---

## Economic Systems: The Salvage Economy

### Material Grading (Dvergr Three-Tier Standard)

| Grade | Condition | Trade Value |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Grade-A** | Minimal oxidation, structurally sound, immediate reuse | 100% Pure Steel value |
| **Grade-B** | Surface corrosion, requires reforging | 60% value |
| **Grade-C** | Deep structural damage, scrap-metal only | 20% value |

Attempting to pass Grade-B as Grade-A results in immediate contract termination and Guild blacklisting—devastating economic penalty in marketplace where reputation is everything.

### Specialized Components

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Adamant-Weave plating** | 200–300 tons purchased annually by Dvergr |
| **Iron Hearts** | 15–500 Cogs depending on condition |
| **Uncorrupted wiring** | Premium pricing due to rarity |
| **Pre-Glitch sealed tools** | 10–50 Cogs per item |
| **Intact bearings** | 5–20 Cogs per unit |

### Contract Enforcement

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Reputation Damage** | Breaking contract brands you "rust-promise" (untrustworthy) |
| **Economic Exclusion** | Prevents future contract opportunities |
| **Social Death** | Word travels fast in tight-knit economy |

Physical enforcement (violence against contract-breakers) is rare because reputation damage is sufficient deterrent.

---

## Factional Relations

### The Dvergr Clans: Pragmatic Partnership

| Dvergr View | Rust-Clan View |
|-------------|----------------|
| "Valuable suppliers of rare materials we cannot access ourselves." | "Reliable buyers who pay fair prices in Pure Steel." |
| "Disdain their chaotic methods and 'bodged' craftsmanship." | "Appreciate their tools but not their condescension." |
| "200–300 tons Adamant-Weave annually—essential raw material." | "40–50% of our export economy—essential customer." |

The Dvergr-Rust-Clan trade relationship is the economic backbone of both factions. The Dvergr provide Pure Steel and reliable clockwork tools; the Rust-Clans provide rare alloys and salvaged components no one else can retrieve.

### The Iron-Bane Crusade: Ideological Enemies

| Iron-Bane View | Rust-Clan View |
|----------------|----------------|
| "Heretics who profit from tainted technology." | "Fanatics who burn useful salvage for theological reasons." |
| "Launch crusades against their Rigs." | "Avoid their territory; refuse escort contracts involving Banes." |
| "The Rust-Clans desecrate what should be cleansed." | "The Iron-Banes destroy what could save lives." |

Zero trade relationship. The Iron-Banes refuse to purchase Jötunheim salvage on theological grounds; the Rust-Clans consider them dangerous lunatics.

### The God-Sleeper Cults: Theological Incompatibility

| God-Sleeper View | Rust-Clan View |
|------------------|----------------|
| "Profane grave-robbers desecrating holy ruins." | "Fools who try to 'wake' obviously-dead machinery." |
| "They strip the Slumbering Gods for scrap." | "Their 'gods' are salvage, same as everything else." |
| "The Rust-Clans lack spiritual understanding." | "Their 'spiritual understanding' gets people killed." |

Utgard's one unifying cultural trait is profound disdain for the three great Creeds. Openly preaching any Creed's dogma is the fastest way to get thrown from the highest gantry.

### The Jötun-Readers: Frustrating Cooperation

| Jötun-Reader View | Rust-Clan View |
|-------------------|----------------|
| "Unwitting archivists who reveal pre-Glitch sites through salvage." | "They want our routes but don't share theirs." |
| "Infuriating—they destroy priceless data-slates for a few kilograms of alloy." | "Data-slates don't fix axles. Alloy does." |
| "We must establish research partnerships." | "Some partnerships work. Most Readers are impractical." |

Some Rig crews maintain informal partnerships with Reader survey teams—providing site access in exchange for structural assessments and hazard mapping.

### The Midgard Combine: Secondary Trade

| Combine View | Rust-Clan View |
|--------------|----------------|
| "Constant pressure from nomadic marauders." | "Soft farmers who grow food we need." |
| "Essential industrial materials for our smiths." | "Essential agricultural products for our crews." |
| "Transactional relationship; they're reliable if rough." | "They pay on time. Good enough." |

---

## Environmental Challenges: Life in Jötunheim

### The Rust-Devils

| Hazard | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Nature** | Corrosive dust storms carrying Rust-Mite spores |
| **Duration** | Hours to days |
| **Protection** | Sealed Rig interiors; filtered breathing apparatus |
| **Damage** | Equipment degradation; respiratory exposure causes Rusting Lung |

### Rusting Lung

| Stage | Symptoms |
|-------|----------|
| **Early** | Chronic cough; reduced stamina |
| **Moderate** | Blood in sputum; breathing difficulty |
| **Advanced** | Lung tissue mineralization; shortened lifespan |
| **Management** | Chelation agents; filtered air; avoid Rust-Devil exposure |

Average Rust-Clan life expectancy: 48–55 years. Rusting Lung is primary cause of early death outside combat.

### The Knuckle-Bone Fields

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Terrain** | Razor-sharp debris carpets from Jötun-Forged construction |
| **Hazard** | Lacerations; puncture wounds; infection |
| **Value** | Richest Adamant-Weave deposits; highest Rig concentration |
| **Navigation** | Requires intimate knowledge of safe paths |

---

## The Scavenger (Player Specialization)

### Overview

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Archetype** | Survivor / Technician |
| **Primary Attributes** | INSIGHT / VIGOR |
| **Core Identity** | Pragmatic salvager; mechanical improviser |
| **Special Feature** | Bodge crafting; Scrap-Rune use; CPS resistance |
| **Trauma Risk** | Moderate (pragmatic worldview buffers ideological shock) |

The Scavenger specialization represents someone trained in the Rust-Clan tradition of survival through improvisation—making do with whatever materials are available, extracting value from apparent junk, and keeping machinery running against all odds.

### Key Abilities

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Bodge Craft** | Improvise repairs from scrap materials |
| **Machine Sense** | Detect mechanical faults; predict failures |
| **Heart-Hunter** | Extract Iron Hearts from automata |
| **Rust Resistance** | Reduced damage from corrosive hazards |
| **Gutter-Galdr** | Use Scrap-Runes with reduced backfire risk |
| **Creedless Mind** | Resistance to theological manipulation and CPS |

---

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic)
*"In the iron deserts where the gods fell to rust and the Great Looms stand silent, the Scrap-Folk make their home. They pray to no sleeping deity, bow to no purifying flame, seek no scholarly truth. They pray only to the Great Gear—the spirit of function—and curse only the Rust that claims all things in time. Their sagas sing not of warriors but of salvagers: those who cracked the Epsilon Vault, who harvested hearts from waking titans, who kept their Rigs rolling when every bearing screamed for death. They are the inheritors of the factory-graveyards, and their creed is simple: 'I owe no man my survival, but I honor my crew.'"*

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic)
*"The Rust-Clans represent post-Glitch humanity's most pragmatic response to civilizational collapse—a radical rejection of grand narratives in favor of radical self-reliance, crew loyalty, and contract sanctity. Their decentralized confederation of 800–1,200 active Rigs operates across Jötunheim's industrial graveyards, extracting Adamant-Weave and pre-Glitch components essential to the broader Aethelgard economy. Population maintenance faces chronic pressure from Rusting Lung, Scrap-War casualties, and environmental hazards—offset by continuous recruitment of Creedless refugees seeking Utgard's sanctuary status. Strategic value derives from exclusive access to Jötunheim salvage, sophisticated material grading expertise, and partial immunity to CPS effects that incapacitate other factions."*

### Layer 3 (Technical)
*"FACTION CLASSIFICATION: Rust-Clans (Jötunheim Salvagers). ORGANIZATIONAL TYPE: Decentralized nomadic confederation. PRIMARY FUNCTION: Salvage extraction and component trade. SECONDARY FUNCTION: Sanctuary provision for Creedless populations. POPULATION: 15,000–25,000 mobile; 10,000+ permanent in Utgard. TERRITORY: Jötunheim Assembly Deck (Knuckle-Bone Fields, Great Looms Corridor, Ash-Blown Wastes). RISK PROFILE: Low (to contracted partners); High (to unannounced visitors in claimed territory). STRATEGIC ASSETS: Adamant-Weave access, salvage expertise, CPS resistance, neutral trade hub. STRATEGIC LIABILITIES: Decentralized governance, inter-Clan violence, chronic health issues."*

## Summary

The Rust-Clans are the children of the assembly line who refused to die when their factory-gods went mad.

Where the Iron-Banes seek to **destroy** the machine-curse and the God-Sleepers seek to **worship** the sleeping gods, the Rust-Clans have found a third path—a path of **pragmatic exploitation**, of **ruthless self-reliance**, of **using what works and discarding what doesn't**.

They do not believe in grand narratives.

They do not believe in divine intervention.

They do not believe in the restoration of the old world or the purification of the new one.

They believe in the Rig beneath their feet, the crew at their back, and the salvage in their hold.

Their ancestors hid in the bellies of dying gods and learned to read the machines from the inside out. Their children navigate razor-sharp debris fields and corrosive dust storms, extracting the materials that keep all of Aethelgard's forges burning. Their grandchildren will do the same—or die trying.

The surface world calls them heretics, grave-robbers, savages. The Rust-Clans do not care. Reputation among outsiders means nothing. Reputation among crews means everything.

A signed contract is sacred—not because the gods demand it, but because your word is the only currency that matters when no institutions guarantee behavior.

A Rig is family—not because blood demands loyalty, but because the crew you choose and who choose you are the only people who will pull you from the wreckage when everything goes wrong.

A salvage claim is territory—not because the law says so, but because you will defend it with ballista and blood against anyone who tries to take it.

They have no Jarls of bloodline.

They have no priests of doctrine.

They have no kings of conquest.

They have only Rig-Masters who earned their authority through competence, crews who earned their loyalty through survival, and contracts that earned their sanctity through honor.

The world calls them the Creedless.

They call themselves something simpler.

**Survivors.**

And survivors do whatever it takes.
