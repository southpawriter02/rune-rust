### **Ability Overview**

**Specialization:** Jötun-Reader (System Pathologist)

**Tier:** 1 (Foundational Analysis)

**Type:** Passive

**Prerequisite:** Unlock the Jötun-Reader Specialization (10 PP)

**Cost:** 3 PP

### **Description**

The Jötun-Reader has dedicated years to studying the syntax of the Elder Futhark as a **dead language**—a forensic linguist translating inscriptions, not a practitioner casting spells. They approach runic text the way a medieval scholar approaches Latin manuscripts: as historical documents to be read and understood, not magical formulas to be executed.

### **Mechanics**

**Effect:** Allows the character to **read and translate** all non-magical runic inscriptions found in the world, including:

- Error logs and warning messages on ancient terminals
- Command-line fragments carved into monuments
- Diagnostic readouts on Jötun-Forged wreckage
- Inscriptions on sealed doors and containment vessels
- Data corruption logs describing system failures

**Limitation - Translation Only:** This is **translation only**. The Jötun-Reader cannot:

- Execute these commands or activate dormant systems
- Recreate runic effects or "cast" runes
- Repair or reprogram corrupted systems

**What They CAN Do:**

- Read the manual (but not operate the machine)
- Translate warning signs (but not disable the hazard)
- Understand error messages (but not fix the error)
- Decipher puzzle clues (but not automatically solve the puzzle)

### **Thematic Justification**

The Jötun-Reader is a **translator and archivist**, not an engineer or mage. They understand the Futhark as a linguistic system, a grammar for describing reality's operations—but they lack the capability to execute those operations. They're archaeologists of a dead language, not practitioners of a living art.

### **Progression & Milestones**

### **Rank 1 (Foundational)**

- **Effect:** Can read and translate all non-magical runic inscriptions (Elder Futhark)
- **Application:** Error logs, command syntax, diagnostic readouts, inscriptions

### **Rank 2 (Expert)**

- **Unlocked:** 20 PP invested in Jötun-Reader tree
- **Effect:** Translation is now **instantaneous**, can translate **fragmentary or corrupted inscriptions** (missing 30-40% of text)
- **Additional:** Can identify the **approximate age** and **origin facility** of inscriptions

### **Rank 3 (Mastery)**

- **Unlocked:** Capstone ability unlocked (35-40 PP in tree)
- **Effect:** Can translate **any** runic text regardless of corruption level, can **extrapolate missing sections** (70-80% accuracy)
- **Additional:** Can identify author/system by "handwriting" style
- **Special:** Once per day, **deep contextual analysis** reveals hidden meanings or encoded secondary messages

### **Integration Notes**

- **Content Gating:** Certain areas, puzzles, and secrets are only accessible with a Jötun-Reader
- **Exploration Tool:** Dramatically increases party's ability to navigate Old World ruins safely
- **Lore Access:** Unlocks environmental storytelling through readable inscriptions
- **Non-Mystic Distinction:** Can read runes but cannot cast with them—key distinction from Mystic specializations

### **Example Applications**

- **Sealed Door:** Translates: "Manual override: disconnect tertiary power coupling." Party must then physically find and disconnect it.
- **Error Terminal:** Reads: "Coolant system offline. Core temperature exceeding safe parameters." Party learns the enemy is vulnerable to cold.
- **Ancient Monument:** Describes hidden supply cache location—Jötun-Reader provides info, party must find it.
