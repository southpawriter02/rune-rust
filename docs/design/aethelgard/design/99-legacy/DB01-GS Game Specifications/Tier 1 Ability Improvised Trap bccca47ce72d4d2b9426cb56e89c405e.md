## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Improvised Trap is the Einbúi's **foundational field crafting and control tool**—the resourceful solution. They create functional, effective traps *right now* from scavenged junk and natural materials.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Apply [Rooted] via triggered trap
- **Secondary:** Battlefield control for non-combat specialist
- **Resource Loop:** Connects scavenging to combat control
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The survivor who weaponizes junk

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Moderate (single-target, predictive)
- **Skill Expression:** Rewards reading enemy movement
- **Component Cost:** Requires scavenged materials

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

With wire, scrap metal, and sinew, the Einbúi quickly assembles a functional snare. It's not elegant—but when it snaps shut on an enemy's leg, **elegance doesn't matter**.

*"Step right there. I dare you."*

### Thematic Resonance

Improvised Trap transforms battlefield junk into tactical advantage—proof that resourcefulness is its own weapon.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Activation

- **Action Type:** Standard Action
- **Cost:** 40 Stamina + 1 [Scrap Metal] + 1 [Tough Leather]
- **Target:** Single unoccupied ground tile

### Trap Properties

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Concealment** | Initially hidden; high Passive Perception may detect |
| **Duration** | 3 rounds or until triggered |
| **Trigger** | Enemy moves onto tile |
| **Effect** | [Rooted] for 1 round |
| **One-Time Use** | Destroyed after triggering |

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Resource Validation:** Confirm Stamina and components
2. **Tile Selection:** Choose unoccupied tile
3. **Cost Payment:** Deduct resources, consume components
4. **Trap Placement:** Create [Concealed Snare Trap] on tile
5. **Trigger Check:** When enemy enters, apply [Rooted]

---

## IV. Progression Path

### Rank 2 (Expert — 20 PP)

- [Rooted] duration increased to 2 rounds

### Rank 3 (Mastery — Capstone via Master Improviser)

- **New:** Also applies [Bleeding] on trigger

---

## V. Tactical Applications

1. **Chokepoint Control:** Block enemy approach paths
2. **Setup Combo:** Root enemy for AoE follow-up
3. **Backline Defense:** Protect vulnerable allies
4. **Push/Pull Synergy:** Allies can force enemies into trap

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Hlekkr-master:** Pull enemies directly into trap
- **AoE damage:** Rooted enemies are perfect targets
- **Predictive players:** Rewards game sense

### Negative Synergies
