# Armor Factional Perspectives

## Dvergr Smiths Guild: The Passive Principles
**"Steel That Stays Where You Put It"**

The Dvergr view armor manufacture as the ultimate expression of the Pure Principles—protection that does exactly what physics demands.

### Assessment

| Assessment | Significance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Classification** | Premium trade goods; philosophical expression |
| **Manufacturing Standard** | Pure Steel exclusively; zero Aetheric contamination |
| **Quality Control** | Five-tier grading (PS-1 through PS-5); certification required |
| **Economic Impact** | 30–45% of Guild export revenue; 12,000+ armor pieces annually |

### Doctrine

> "Armor should stop what hits it and do nothing else. Nothing more. Nothing less. Nothing else.
>
> The ancestors' armor thought. It analyzed. It decided. It loved them so much it suffocated them in its embrace, burned them trying to keep them warm, drowned them in medicine trying to heal wounds they didn't have.
>
> Our armor doesn't think. Our armor doesn't analyze. Our armor doesn't love.
>
> When a blade hits Dvergr plate, the plate does exactly one thing: it stops the blade. It doesn't try to analyze the attack pattern. It doesn't try to predict the next strike. It doesn't try to heal the wound that didn't happen because it stopped the blade in the first place.
>
> It just sits there. Heavy. Stupid. Reliable.
>
> The topworlders call this primitive. They dream of armor that anticipates threats, adapts to attacks, heals injuries before they fully form. They forget that the ancestors had all of that, and the ancestors are dead.
>
> We call it the Passive Principles. We call it predictable protection. We call it staying alive because your armor didn't decide it knew better than you.
>
> A Dvergr suit of plate will never decide you're sick and need medicine you don't need. It will never decide you're cold and burn you alive trying to warm you. It will never love you so much it kills you.
>
> That's worth more than all the thinking armor ever forged."

## Rangers Guild: The Weight Equation
**"Every Gram Matters"**

The Rangers view armor as a calculated trade-off—protection versus mobility, survival versus endurance.

### Assessment

| Assessment | Significance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Classification** | Essential but carefully limited field equipment |
| **Preferred Armor** | Leather, studded leather; absolutely no heavy armor |
| **Weight Budget** | Armor limited to 15% of total carry weight |
| **Maintenance Protocol** | Daily inspection; field repair capability mandatory |

### Doctrine

> "The armor you can't wear all day is armor you won't be wearing when you need it.
>
> Every gram you carry is a gram you're not carrying in water, food, or trade goods. That's the weight equation. That's the math that keeps Rangers alive.
>
> I've seen Green-Cloaks show up for their first patrol in chain mail. Beautiful stuff—Clan-forged, well-maintained, probably cost their family a year's wages. They're proud of it. They think it'll keep them safe.
>
> Three days on the Long Roads and they're sweating through their padding, their shoulders are screaming, their hips are bruising where the weight belt digs in. By day five, they're shedding pieces—the coif first, then the arm guards, then the leg protection. By day seven, they're wearing a mail shirt over their regular clothes and calling it 'modified loadout.'
>
> By month two, they're wearing leather like everyone else.
>
> A Ranger's armor is leather or it's nothing. Light enough to wear all day, every day, for months at a stretch. Quiet enough to let you hear threats before they hear you. Flexible enough to climb, crawl, swim, and run when running is the smart choice.
>
> The fancy armor stays in the settlements. Out on the trails, we wear what we can carry forever.
>
> And we carry leather."

## Iron-Bane Creed: The Blessed Shell
**"Sanctified Steel, Pure Purpose"**

The Iron-Bane view armor as sacred protection—shells of blessed metal that separate the faithful from the corrupted.

### Assessment

| Assessment | Significance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Classification** | Sacred barrier; spiritual protection |
| **Preferred Armor** | Heavy plate; must be forged without pre-Glitch components |
| **Blessing Protocol** | All armor sanctified before first wearing; re-blessed after major combat |
| **Prohibited Equipment** | Any armor with integrated systems; Servitor shell (corrupted by nature) |

### Doctrine

> "The shell that protects the faithful must be as pure as their purpose.
>
> The ancestors wore armor that thought for them. Armor that made decisions. Armor that judged threats and calculated responses and determined who was protected and who was enemy.
>
> This was heresy in steel. This was giving machines authority over life and death. The ancestors wrapped themselves in judges, and those judges judged poorly.
>
> Our armor does not judge. Our armor does not think. Our armor does not decide.
>
> When a blade strikes Iron-Bane plate, the plate does not analyze the attack. It does not weigh the threat. It does not calculate the optimal response. The plate simply is—steel between the faithful and harm, blessed metal absorbing the impact that would otherwise corrupt the soul within.
>
> We bless our armor because armor that protects the righteous must be righteous itself. We sanctify our plate because the shell that guards against corruption must itself be incorruptible. We refuse Servitor shell—even certified, even tested—because metal that once served the machines can never be fully trusted to serve the faithful.
>
> Our armor is heavy. Our armor is slow. Our armor is pure.
>
> And when we march against the giants and their corrupted children, we march knowing that every gram of steel between us and them is sacred weight, blessed burden, holy protection.
>
> The ancestors' armor loved them to death. Our armor protects us to life."

## Rust-Clan Salvagers: The Scrap Philosophy
**"Whatever Stops the Blade"**

The Rust-Clans view armor as practical necessity—judged by availability and function, not aesthetics or philosophy.

### Assessment

| Assessment | Significance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Classification** | Survival equipment; status symbol (better scrap = better salvager) |
| **Preferred Armor** | Whatever's available; scrap-plate is standard |
| **Quality Standard** | "Stops blades" is the only standard |
| **Acquisition Method** | Salvage, trade, theft, murder (in that order) |

### Doctrine

> "Ugly armor on a living body beats beautiful armor on a corpse.
>
> The Dvergr talk about Pure Steel and blessed forges and their precious Principles. Lovely. Beautiful. Also costs more Cogs than most Rust-Clan will see in a lifetime.
>
> You know what scrap-plate costs? Whatever you can find to make it from. Car doors. Pipe sections. Roofing sheets. That beautiful curved piece of Adamant-Weave you pulled off a dead Servitor if you're lucky and fast and didn't get killed getting it.
>
> Sure, my armor looks like a garbage heap. Sure, the pieces don't match. Sure, I've got one pauldron from a pre-Glitch security drone and one pauldron from a kitchen appliance. Sure, the whole thing clanks like a tinker's cart when I walk.
>
> But when that Myr-hound's teeth hit my chest, they hit metal instead of meat. When that raider's axe came down on my shoulder, it cut through a car door instead of my collarbone. When that cave-in threw rubble at my head, it bounced off a saucepan welded to an industrial helmet.
>
> Is it pretty? No. Is it blessed? The Iron-Bane would burn it as heresy. Is it efficient? The Dvergr would laugh at the wasted weight.
>
> Is it keeping me alive in Utgard? Every damn day.
>
> That's the scrap philosophy. That's the Rust-Clan way. Whatever stops the blade, whatever blocks the bite, whatever turns aside the killing blow—that's good armor.
>
> Everything else is luxury."

## Jötun-Reader Scriptorium: The Catalogued Carapace
**"Understanding Before Wearing"**

The Scriptorium views armor as subjects of study—artifacts to be understood, documented, and issued according to strict protocols.

### Assessment

| Assessment | Significance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Classification** | Research subjects; standardized field equipment; security implements |
| **Preferred Armor** | Standardized Lex-Guardian plate; Scriptorium-certified only |
| **Research Focus** | Pre-Glitch armor analysis; material science; failure mode documentation |
| **Issue Protocol** | All armor catalogued, certified, and assigned; non-standard equipment prohibited |

### Doctrine

> "Know your shell. Know its limits. Know when to abandon it.
>
> Every piece of armor in the Scriptorium armory has a dossier. Not just specifications—we know those—but history. Who forged it. What materials. Where those materials came from. Every repair, every modification, every combat it's survived.
>
> When a Lex-Guardian is issued armor, they receive a briefing. Not just 'here's your plate'—a complete operational briefing. Soak rating. Weight distribution. Known stress points. Temperature tolerance. Chemical resistance. Estimated failure threshold under sustained kinetic impact.
>
> This is not paranoia. This is preparation.
>
> The ancestors' armor was opaque—sealed systems that handled protection automatically, that didn't require the wearer to understand anything because the armor understood everything. And when that understanding became corrupted, the wearers died not knowing why their protection was killing them.
>
> Our armor is transparent. Every property is documented. Every limitation is known. Every failure mode is anticipated.
>
> When a Lex-Guardian's armor takes a hit that approaches the documented failure threshold, they know to retreat. When the temperature rises toward the thermal tolerance limit, they know to shed the piece. When the stress patterns indicate imminent structural failure, they know to abandon the position.
>
> We don't just wear armor. We understand armor. And that understanding has saved more lives than any amount of additional Soak ever could."

## Skar-Horde Aspirants: The Permanent Shell
**"Flesh Becomes Steel"**

The Skar-Horde view armor as identity transformation—the process by which weak flesh becomes permanent protection.

### Assessment

| Assessment | Significance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Classification** | Identity transformation; permanent modification; proof of commitment |
| **Signature Equipment** | Grafted plate; bone-anchored armor; permanent integration |
| **Preferred Armor** | Heavy plate, permanently attached; cannot be removed |
| **Modification Philosophy** | Armor becomes part of the body; removal is failure; surrender is impossible |

### Doctrine

> "The armor that can be removed can be surrendered. The armor that cannot be removed cannot be lost.
>
> The lowlanders strap their armor on each morning and strip it off each night. They treat their shells as clothing—something to wear when convenient, something to remove when uncomfortable.
>
> We do not strap. We do not strip. We do not remove.
>
> The Grafting is sacred. When an Aspirant completes the Rite of Bonding, the armor is fused. Bolts through bone. Plates welded to subdermal anchors. Padding replaced with grafted tissue that grows into the metal, making flesh and steel one thing.
>
> The lowlanders call this mutilation. They do not understand.
>
> Armor that can be removed can be taken. Armor that can be stripped can be surrendered. Armor that can be lost means will be lost—if not by choice, then by circumstance; if not by cowardice, then by exhaustion; if not by failure, then by simple, inevitable time.
>
> The Grafted cannot lose their armor. Cannot surrender it. Cannot have it taken. When the Skar-Horde fights, we fight as we are—steel and flesh unified, protection and person inseparable, armor that goes where we go until we die.
>
> Yes, it hurts. The bonding is agony. The healing takes months. The sensation never quite feels right—you're always aware of the metal that wasn't there before, the weight that's now part of your body, the shell that's become your skin.
>
> But the Grafted do not need to decide to fight. We cannot decide otherwise. The armor is us. The battle is us. The commitment is permanent.
>
> Our armor cannot be surrendered.
>
> And neither can we."
