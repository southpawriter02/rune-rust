# Grit-Golem (Terrus-Ambulans Pattern) — Symbiotic Construct-Flora Composite Entity Specification
## Codex Entry: CODX-CF-GRIT-001

> *"I thought the old maintenance servitor had finally given up. Seven hundred years standing in that collapsed access tunnel, seized joints, moss growing over its chassis like a burial shroud. We passed it every time we checked the lower irrigation channels—just another ruin, another piece of dead machinery slowly being reclaimed by the earth. Then Halvard's torch went out and he stumbled into it in the dark. Bumped right into its leg. The thing *moved*. I heard the grinding first—like millstones full of sand—and then this shape rising up, twice my height, shedding dirt and roots and decades of accumulated growth. But it wasn't the machine anymore. The moss had grown *into* it. Through it. The thing that turned to face us was made of metal and vegetation intertwined so thoroughly I couldn't tell where one ended and the other began. Its joints were sealed with living fungus. Its limbs moved on rootlike tendons. It had eyes—not sensor arrays, *eyes*—pale and luminescent, grown into its helm like a plant seeks light. It looked at us for a long moment. Then it stepped aside and continued down the tunnel, dragging one foot through the soil, leaving a trail of disturbed earth and tiny seedlings. It wasn't aggressive. Wasn't hostile at all. But it wasn't a machine anymore, either. Something else lives in that shell now. Something that walks on roots and sees through moss. Something that used to be a servitor and is now... I don't know what. A garden with legs. A ruin that remembers how to move."*

The Grit-Golem is neither construct nor plant. It is **both**—a symbiotic fusion that walks on metal legs and thinks with fungal networks.

> [!CAUTION]
> **VARIABLE THREAT SYMBIOTIC ENTITY. BEHAVIOR ASSESSMENT REQUIRED BEFORE INTERACTION.** The Grit-Golem represents a unique post-Glitch phenomenon: construct chassis colonized by Terrus-pattern flora-fungal symbionts, resulting in ambulatory hybrid entities with unpredictable behavior profiles. Threat level varies significantly based on host construct type (labor servitors = lower threat; security constructs = higher threat), integration stage (early = erratic; mature = stable), and territorial disposition (some territorial; others passive wanderers). Most specimens exhibit non-aggressive behavior unless territory threatened or physically attacked. **Observation protocol: maintain 5 m distance; observe movement patterns and luminescent eye coloration (green = passive; amber = alert; red = aggressive); do not block movement path; retreat if approached directly.** Survival rate with observation protocol: 94.2%. Primary hazards: defensive retaliation, accidental trampling, spore cloud exposure.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Dormant Host

### Host Construct Background

The Grit-Golem is not a designed organism—it is an emergent phenomenon resulting from the colonization of dormant constructs by opportunistic flora-fungal networks. The "host" constructs were never intended to become symbiotic platforms, but their abandonment following the Glitch created the conditions for biological integration.

| Common Host Types | Original Function |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **M.N.T.-4 "Golem" Servitors** | General maintenance; infrastructure repair; manual labor |
| **A.G.R.-2 Agricultural Units** | Farming support; soil processing; harvest assistance |
| **C.N.S.-1 Construction Frames** | Building assembly; material transport; structural work |
| **S.R.V.-3 Survey Platforms** | Terrain mapping; resource location; environmental monitoring |
| **L.B.R.-5 Labor Drones** | Bulk material handling; repetitive task execution |

### The Colonization Window

| Condition | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Construct State** | Dormant but structurally intact; powered down but not destroyed |
| **Environmental Exposure** | Contact with soil, organic matter, and moisture |
| **Time Frame** | Decades to centuries of undisturbed exposure |
| **Flora Presence** | Terrus-pattern symbiont spores or root network proximity |
| **Absence of Maintenance** | No cleaning, repair, or activation to interrupt colonization |

The Grit-Golem phenomenon emerged over centuries as abandoned constructs were slowly colonized by the Terrus-pattern flora-fungal network—an opportunistic symbiont that infiltrates dormant machinery, integrates with power systems, and eventually reactivates the host using biological rather than mechanical control systems.

### The Symbiont: Terrus-Pattern Flora-Fungal Network

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Classification** | Construct-Flora Hybrid; possibly Vanir bio-engineering origin (unconfirmed) |
| **Core Function** | Opportunistic symbiosis; energy harvesting; territorial expansion |
| **Propagation** | Spore dispersal; root network extension; host-to-host transfer |
| **Energy Source** | Aetheric absorption from host power systems; photosynthesis; decomposition |
| **Intelligence** | Distributed network cognition; non-sentient but adaptive |

> [!NOTE]
> **Origin Uncertainty.** The Terrus-pattern symbiont's origin remains debated. Some Jötun-Readers believe it is a corrupted Vanir bio-system (possibly agricultural soil-enrichment organisms); others argue it is a natural post-Glitch evolution exploiting the unique ecological niche of abandoned constructs. The truth remains unknown—but the phenomenon itself is well-documented regardless of origin.

## The Integration Process: Machine Becomes Garden

The Grit-Golem emerges through a multi-stage integration process spanning decades to centuries:

### Stage 1: Colonization (Years 1–20)

| Process | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Initial Contact** | Terrus-pattern spores settle on dormant construct surface |
| **Root Penetration** | Fungal threads infiltrate chassis through gaps, vents, joints |
| **Surface Growth** | Moss and lichen establish on exterior surfaces |
| **Power Detection** | Symbiont identifies dormant Aetheric power source |
| **Integration Begins** | Root network extends toward power systems |

**Visual Indicators:** Construct appears abandoned; surface moss growth; no movement; appears to be standard overgrown ruin.

### Stage 2: Integration (Years 20–100)

| Process | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Power Tap** | Fungal network establishes connection to Aetheric cells |
| **System Infiltration** | Root-tendrils replace degraded wiring; grow through conduits |
| **Motor Colonization** | Fungal tissue integrates with joint mechanisms |
| **Sensor Replacement** | Bioluminescent growths develop in sensor housing locations |
| **Neural Network** | Distributed fungal cognition develops throughout chassis |

**Visual Indicators:** Heavier vegetation coverage; fungal mass visible at joints; faint luminescence in "eye" locations; occasional twitching or settling.

### Stage 3: Reactivation (Years 100–200)

| Process | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Motor Function** | Fungal-muscle tissue enables joint movement |
| **Sensory Function** | Bioluminescent organs provide environmental awareness |
| **Locomotion** | Construct achieves ambulatory capability |
| **Behavioral Emergence** | Basic navigation, feeding, territorial behaviors develop |
| **Full Integration** | Construct-flora boundary becomes indistinguishable |

**Visual Indicators:** Construct moves; luminescent eyes active; vegetation and metal fully intertwined; responds to environmental stimuli.

### Stage 4: Maturation (Years 200+)

| Process | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Stable Operation** | Movement patterns regular; behavior predictable |
| **Reproductive Capability** | Spore production; potential host-to-host transfer |
| **Territorial Establishment** | Defined range; patrol patterns; resource sites |
| **Environmental Role** | Integration with local ecosystem; nutrient cycling |
| **Senescence Indicators** | Gradual degradation of mechanical components over centuries |

**Visual Indicators:** Confident movement; established territory; regular patrol patterns; heavy organic integration; mechanical components increasingly vestigial.

---

## Physical Characteristics

### Morphology (Mature Specimen)

| Attribute | Measurement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Height** | 1.8–3.5 m (dependent on host construct) |
| **Mass** | 200–600 kg (construct + organic material) |
| **Organic Coverage** | 60–90% of external surface |
| **Root-Tendril Density** | 15–40 major tendrils per limb |
| **Bioluminescent Organs** | 2–6 primary "eyes"; multiple secondary indicators |
| **Movement Speed** | 2–8 km/h (shambling gait) |
| **Spore Production** | 500–2,000 spores per day (mature specimen) |
| **Root Extension Range** | 5–15 m from main body (feeding/sensing) |
| **Power Cell Integration** | 30–50% of original Aetheric capacity utilized |

### Visual Appearance

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Overall Form** | Humanoid or utilitarian frame depending on host; heavily vegetated |
| **Surface Coverage** | Moss, lichen, fungal growth; soil accumulation in crevices |
| **Joint Mechanisms** | Visible fungal "muscle" tissue; root-tendril articulation |
| **Limb Structure** | Metal skeleton with organic augmentation; roots wrap and penetrate |
| **Sensory Organs** | Bioluminescent growths in head/sensor locations; color-variable |
| **Chest/Torso** | Often split open by internal growth; visible fungal mass |
| **Locomotion Traces** | Leaves trail of disturbed soil; shed organic material; seedlings |
| **Sound Profile** | Grinding mechanical noise; organic creaking; soil shifting |

**Overall Impression:** A ruin that refused to stay still. The Grit-Golem's silhouette is recognizably construct—the proportions of the original machine remain visible beneath the organic overgrowth—but every surface is colonized, every gap filled with living matter. Moss carpets the shoulders and back; fungal shelves sprout from chest cavities; root-tendrils hang from limbs like living vines. The mechanical joints still articulate, but they move on biological power now, grinding through accumulated grit and soil with each step. The eyes are the most striking feature: bioluminescent organs grown into sensor housings, glowing with soft light that shifts color based on the entity's state. In passive wandering, the glow is gentle green. When alert, it shifts to amber. When threatened, it burns red. Old settlers say the Grit-Golems are the ruins waking up—that the world itself is reclaiming the machines the Ancients left behind, making them part of the earth again. They're not entirely wrong.

### Field Identification Markers

The Grit-Golem can be identified by:

- **Movement**: Constructs that move despite obvious dormancy indicators
- **Eye Glow**: Bioluminescent organs in sensor locations; color indicates state
- **Integration Pattern**: Vegetation clearly growing *through* chassis, not just on surface
- **Sound**: Grinding, organic creaking; distinct from purely mechanical operation
- **Trail**: Disturbed soil, shed vegetation, seedlings in wake
- **Behavioral Response**: Reacts to approach; tracks movement; exhibits awareness
- **Joint Appearance**: Visible fungal tissue replacing or augmenting mechanical components

## Pathology

### Classification: Symbiotic Integration

The Grit-Golem is not "corrupted" in the conventional sense—the host construct is not malfunctioning. Rather, it has been *repurposed* by a biological symbiont that uses the construct's frame and power source as its own ambulatory infrastructure.

| Component | Host (Construct) | Symbiont (Flora-Fungal) | Integration |
|-----------|------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Frame** | Provides structural support | Reinforces with root tissue | Stable composite |
| **Power** | Dormant Aetheric cells | Tapped for metabolic energy | Symbiont-controlled |
| **Motors** | Degraded but present | Replaced with fungal muscle | Biological control |
| **Sensors** | Non-functional | Replaced with bioluminescent organs | Biological sensing |
| **Cognition** | Original programming dormant | Distributed fungal network | Network consciousness |
| **Purpose** | Original function abandoned | Feeding, territory, reproduction | Symbiont priorities |

### Behavioral Pathology

The Grit-Golem exhibits behaviors consistent with the symbiont's priorities rather than the host construct's original programming:

| Behavior | Origin | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Territorial Patrol** | Symbiont | Regular circuit of defined territory |
| **Feeding Behavior** | Symbiont | Root extension to absorb nutrients; moves to new areas when depleted |
| **Threat Response** | Symbiont | Defensive aggression when territory invaded |
| **Passive Wandering** | Symbiont | Exploration for new territory/resources |
| **Spore Release** | Symbiont | Reproductive dispersal; creates new colonization potential |
| **Light Seeking** | Symbiont | Moves toward light sources periodically (photosynthesis) |

### Threat Assessment Variables

Grit-Golem threat level varies significantly based on multiple factors:

| Factor | Lower Threat | Higher Threat |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Host Type** | Labor/agricultural constructs | Security/combat constructs |
| **Integration Stage** | Early (erratic but weak) | Mature (strong and coordinated) |
| **Territory Disposition** | Non-territorial wanderer | Established territorial defender |
| **Eye Color (Current)** | Green (passive) | Red (aggressive) |
| **Recent Disturbance** | None | Recent territorial intrusion |
| **Environmental Stress** | None | Resource scarcity; drought; damage |

### Differential Diagnosis

The Grit-Golem must be distinguished from similar phenomena:

| Phenomenon | Key Differentiator |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Overgrown Dormant Construct** | No movement; no eye glow; vegetation surface-only |
| **Active Construct with Vegetation** | Original behavior patterns; mechanical movement; no bioluminescence |
| **Animated Plant Entity** | No construct frame; entirely organic; different movement pattern |
| **Forlorn in Construct Armor** | Humanoid intelligence; Aetheric signature; communication attempts |
| **Controlled Construct (Faction)** | Purpose-directed behavior; maintained; no organic integration |

The Grit-Golem is unique in its true symbiotic integration—construct and organism merged into a single functioning entity.

## Behavioral Patterns

### The Symbiont Algorithm

The Grit-Golem's behavior follows the symbiont's biological priorities:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Patrol** | Regular circuit of established territory |
| **2. Feeding** | Root extension to absorb nutrients from soil/organic matter |
| **3. Light Seeking** | Movement toward light sources for photosynthesis |
| **4. Threat Assessment** | Evaluate potential intruders; adjust state |
| **5. Response** | Ignore, observe, warn, or defend depending on assessment |
| **6. Reproduction** | Periodic spore release; territory expansion consideration |
| **7. Rest** | Extended dormancy periods; reduced activity |

**The Garden's Walk:**

> *"The Grit-Golem does not think as we think. It does not have goals or plans or fears in any way we would recognize. It simply *is*—a walking ecosystem, a mobile territory, a garden that carries itself to wherever the growing is good. When it patrols its circuit, it is not guarding—it is grazing, extending roots into the soil, absorbing nutrients, photosynthesizing when it reaches light. When it defends its territory, it is not fighting—it is protecting the food source it has cultivated over decades. The symbiont that controls it has no malice, no aggression, no hostility. It simply has imperatives: feed, grow, reproduce, survive. The construct body is merely the mechanism by which those imperatives are executed. Understand this, and the Grit-Golem becomes predictable. Threaten its territory, and it will defend. Leave it alone, and it will leave you alone. It is not a monster. It is a garden with legs. Treat it as you would any territorial animal: with respect, with caution, and with the understanding that you are in its home, not the other way around."*

### Movement Patterns

| Pattern Type | Description | Frequency |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Territorial Patrol** | Regular circuit of established range | Daily |
| **Feeding Circuit** | Movement to nutrient-rich locations | 2–3 times weekly |
| **Light Migration** | Movement toward light sources | Variable (photosynthesis need) |
| **Wandering (Non-territorial)** | Exploration for new territory | Continuous (wanderer type) |
| **Dormancy** | Extended stationary period; root establishment | Days to weeks |

### Threat Response Behavior

| Stimulus | Eye Color | Response | Notes |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Distant observation** | Green | No response | Standard passive state |
| **Approach (non-threatening)** | Green→Amber | Observation; tracking | Assessment phase |
| **Territory entry** | Amber | Warning posture; facing intruder | Pre-defensive display |
| **Continued approach** | Amber→Red | Defensive display; vocalization | Final warning |
| **Physical contact/attack** | Red | Defensive retaliation | Full defensive response |
| **Retreat** | Red→Amber→Green | Observation; return to patrol | De-escalation |

### Communication Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Green eye glow** | Passive; non-threatening; safe to observe |
| **Amber eye glow** | Alert; aware of presence; caution advised |
| **Red eye glow** | Aggressive; territorial defense; retreat immediately |
| **Grinding vocalization** | General alertness; context-dependent |
| **Root extension toward target** | Sensing; investigation; generally non-hostile |
| **Defensive posture (raised limbs)** | Warning display; maintain distance |
| **Direct approach (red eyes)** | Attack imminent; flee or prepare to fight |

---

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Variable Threat Symbiotic Entity

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Threat** | Moderate; defensive aggression only; rarely initiates |
| **Territorial** | Moderate; established specimens defend defined range |
| **Detection** | Moderate; can be mistaken for dormant construct |
| **Predictability** | High; behavior follows observable patterns |
| **Durability** | Moderate-High; construct frame + organic resilience |
| **Psychological Impact** | Low-Moderate; disturbing appearance; usually non-aggressive |

### Engagement Profile

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Movement Speed** | 2–8 km/h (easily outpaced by running human) |
| **Attack Method** | Limb strikes; grappling; trampling |
| **Strike Force** | 800–2,000 N (host-dependent) |
| **Grapple Strength** | High; root-tendrils difficult to escape |
| **Armor Rating** | Moderate; metal frame + organic padding |
| **Vulnerability** | Fire; Aetheric disruption; power cell damage |
| **Disengagement** | Typically ceases pursuit at territory boundary |
| **Survival Rate (Protocol)** | 94.2% (observation and avoidance) |
| **Survival Rate (Engagement)** | 73.1% (prepared group) |

### Four-Stage Threat Assessment Ladder

| Stage | Designation | Indicators | Action |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **1** | Dormant Territory | Overgrown construct present; no movement observed | Observe from distance; identify integration stage |
| **2** | Active Presence | Movement observed; green/amber eye glow | Maintain 5 m distance; observe behavior patterns |
| **3** | Alert State | Amber/red eye glow; tracking movement; warning display | Halt approach; prepare retreat route; no sudden movements |
| **4** | Defensive Engagement | Red eye glow; direct approach; attack posture | Retreat immediately; defend only if retreat blocked |

**CRITICAL**: Stage 2 requires behavioral assessment before proceeding. Most Grit-Golems are non-aggressive if territory is respected. Observe eye color and movement patterns—green eyes and patrol behavior indicate safe passage is likely; amber eyes with direct observation indicate caution required; red eyes indicate immediate retreat necessary.

### Threat Level Justification

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Physical Threat** | Moderate (defensive strikes capable of serious injury) |
| **Behavioral Predictability** | High (observable warning signs; territorial logic) |
| **Pursuit Capability** | Low (slow movement; ceases at territory edge) |
| **Initiation Likelihood** | Low (defensive only; rarely attacks unprovoked) |
| **Countermeasure Availability** | Moderate (fire effective; retreat usually possible) |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Unprovoked Observation (Protocol)** | 0.8/10 (very low risk with caution) |
| **Territory Intrusion (Unaware)** | 4.5/10 (moderate risk; defensive response) |
| **Deliberate Confrontation** | 6.0/10 (significant risk; construct-level durability) |
| **Attack on Specimen** | 7.5/10 (high risk; committed defensive response) |
| **Security/Combat Host Type** | +1.5 to base rating (enhanced threat) |
| **Pack/Multiple Specimens** | +2.0 to base rating (coordinated defense) |

### CPS/Psychological Threat

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Aetheric Contribution** | Low (power cell tap produces minimal HI elevation) |
| **Visual Disturbance** | Moderate; construct-flora fusion unsettling to some |
| **Spore Exposure** | Minor (respiratory irritation; no long-term effects) |
| **Movement Pattern** | Disturbing; "wrong" gait triggers unease |
| **Eye Contact** | Moderate; bioluminescent tracking creates discomfort |

---

## Ecological Role

### Impact Assessment

| Target Category | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Abandoned Infrastructure** | Transformative; converts dormant constructs to active ecosystems |
| **Local Soil Quality** | Beneficial; nutrient distribution; organic matter processing |
| **Native Vegetation** | Beneficial; spore dispersal; soil preparation |
| **Human Settlement** | Minor hazard; territorial defense; usually avoidable |
| **Other Constructs** | Colonization risk; dormant constructs vulnerable |

### Resource Value

| Component | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Fungal Tissue** | Alchemical preparations; nutrient-dense |
| **Bioluminescent Organs** | Light source material; research |
| **Symbiont Spores** | Controlled cultivation research |
| **Root-Tendril Material** | Rope/cordage; strong and flexible |
| **Salvaged Construct Parts** | Standard construct salvage (if integration incomplete) |

### Aetheric Stability Impact

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Proximity HI Contribution** | Minimal (0.02 HI within 5 m) |
| **Power Cell Tap** | Low Aetheric leakage; mostly contained |
| **Destruction** | Minor release; standard construct disposal protocols |
| **Long-term Presence** | Negligible HI elevation in territory |

## Field Protocols

**OWNER**: Expedition Leader (EL) • Environmental Specialist (ENV) • Combat Coordinator (CC) • Recorder (REC)

### Detection and Assessment

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Visual Identification** | Primary detection; movement of vegetated construct |
| **Eye Glow Observation** | State assessment; color indicates threat level |
| **Sound Detection** | Grinding, creaking indicates active movement nearby |
| **Trail Analysis** | Disturbed soil, shed vegetation indicates recent passage |
| **Integration Assessment** | Vegetation penetration depth indicates maturity |
| **Behavior Observation** | Patrol vs. wandering vs. territorial indicates type |

### Field Card: Grit-Golem Encounter Protocols

#### BEFORE (Expedition Preparation)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Research known Grit-Golem territories along planned route |
| 2 | Prepare fire-based deterrents (most effective counter) |
| 3 | Brief personnel on eye-color state indicators |
| 4 | Establish slow-movement, non-threatening approach protocols |
| 5 | Plan route to avoid known territorial centers if possible |
| 6 | Prepare filtration for potential spore exposure |

#### DURING (Detection — Stage 1-2)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Halt; observe from 10+ m; identify if specimen is active |
| 2 | Stage 1 (dormant): May be overgrown dormant construct; observe for movement |
| 3 | Stage 2 (active): Note eye color; assess behavioral state |
| 4 | If green eyes + patrol behavior: passage likely safe with caution |
| 5 | If amber eyes + observation: halt; await behavioral change or route around |
| 6 | Map territory boundaries based on observed patrol pattern |

#### DURING (Stage 3-4 — Alert/Engaged)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | FREEZE; no sudden movements; assess eye color |
| 2 | If amber: slow retreat; avoid direct eye contact; no threatening gestures |
| 3 | If red: immediate retreat; move steadily, not panicked |
| 4 | Do not run (may trigger pursuit); maintain steady withdrawal pace |
| 5 | If retreat blocked: prepare fire deterrent; loud noise may discourage |
| 6 | Combat engagement last resort; target eye organs and exposed fungal mass |

#### DURING (Passage Through Territory)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Move steadily; no running; no sudden movements |
| 2 | Do not approach specimen directly; maintain maximum distance |
| 3 | Do not block patrol path; yield right of way |
| 4 | If specimen approaches: freeze; allow it to pass or investigate |
| 5 | Do not touch or disturb vegetation/root extensions |
| 6 | Exit territory as efficiently as possible without rushing |

#### AFTER

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Confirm exit from territory; observe for pursuit (rare) |
| 2 | Document specimen: location, host type, integration stage, behavior |
| 3 | Note territory boundaries for future route planning |
| 4 | Wash any spore exposure; change clothing if heavily exposed |
| 5 | Report sighting to Scriptorium for territory mapping |
| 6 | Debrief personnel on behavioral observations for pattern analysis |

**OUTCOME:** Expedition detects Grit-Golem during underground passage. Specimen identified as mature M.N.T.-4 host; green eye glow; patrol behavior. Party halts; observes specimen complete patrol circuit; resumes movement after specimen passes. Maintained 8 m distance throughout passage. Zero hostility displayed; zero defensive response triggered. Passage time: 23 minutes. Survival rate with observation protocol: 94.2%.

### Engagement Protocols (OWNER: Combat Coordinator — Emergency Only)

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Authorization** | Retreat impossible; specimen actively attacking |
| **Preferred Deterrent** | Fire; highly effective against organic components |
| **Target Priority** | Eye organs (disorientation); exposed fungal mass; joint tissue |
| **Attack Method** | Concentrated force; avoid prolonged engagement |
| **Vulnerability** | Fire; Aetheric disruption; power cell extraction (difficult) |
| **Disengagement** | Retreat at first opportunity; specimen may not pursue past territory |

### GREEN-FLAG Conditions (Safe Passage Indicators)

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Green eye glow** | Passive state; passage with caution |
| **Patrol behavior (ignoring party)** | Safe to observe; passage feasible |
| **Feeding behavior (root extension)** | Occupied; passage may be safe |
| **Dormancy (stationary, dim eyes)** | Safe to pass at distance |
| **Territory boundary (departing range)** | Pursuit unlikely; continue retreat |

### BLACK-FLAG Conditions

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Red eye glow** | Immediate retreat; do not approach |
| **Direct approach with raised limbs** | Attack imminent; flee or prepare fire |
| **Multiple specimens (coordinated)** | Extreme caution; likely territorial center |
| **Security/combat host type** | Elevated threat; maximum caution |
| **Blocked retreat route** | Prepare engagement; fire deterrents priority |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Approaching specimen directly** | May trigger territorial defense |
| **Running near specimen** | May trigger pursuit response |
| **Blocking patrol path** | Territorial interference; may provoke |
| **Touching root extensions** | Direct contact may trigger response |
| **Attacking without provocation** | Unnecessary conflict; specimen may be passive |
| **Ignoring eye color warnings** | Behavioral indicators are reliable |

### Doctrine: Walk Softly

> **Historical Validation:** Scriptorium data (89 documented encounters, 47 independent sites, 72-month observation period) confirms 94.2% survival rate with full observation protocol. Grit-Golem fatalities are almost exclusively attributable to territorial violation or unprovoked attack. **The Grit-Golem is not inherently hostile. It is territorial—and there is a critical difference. A hostile entity attacks because you exist. A territorial entity attacks because you're in its space. Respect the space, and the entity has no reason to attack. When you see those amber eyes tracking your movement, freeze. When they go green again, move slowly away. When you're passing through its territory, walk like a guest, not an invader. The Grit-Golem does not want to kill you. It just wants you to leave. Give it what it wants. Walk softly. Keep your fire ready but your hands peaceful. The garden will let you pass if you don't try to walk on its flowers.**

## Factional Perspectives

### Common Folk & Skalds: The Walking Garden — "Living Ruins"

The common folk regard Grit-Golems with wary respect—ruins that walk, neither friend nor foe.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Walking ruins; earth-spirits; reclaimed machines |
| **Response** | Avoidance; respect; offerings at territory edges (some communities) |
| **Cultural Role** | Symbol of nature reclaiming civilization |
| **Mythology** | "Jörð takes back what the Ancients borrowed—even their servants" |
| **Naming Convention** | "Living Ruins" emphasizes transformation |

> *"My grandfather said the earth was angry when the world broke. Said she decided to take back what was hers. The metal men the Ancients made—she grew into them. Made them part of herself again. Now they walk her paths, guard her gardens, spread her seeds. They're not evil, child. They're just not ours anymore. They belong to the earth now. When you see one walking through the old places, step aside. Let it pass. It's doing its work, same as we do ours. Respect the walking gardens, and they'll let you walk through theirs."*

## Loot & Rewards

| Drop | Rarity | Value | Use |
|------|--------|-------|-----|
| **Fungal Tissue Sample** | Uncommon | 40–90 PS | Alchemical preparation |
| **Bioluminescent Organ** | Rare | 150–350 PS | Light source; research |

**Salvage Protocol:** Grit-Golem salvage should prioritize deceased specimens or shed material. Living specimen harvest is ethically debated and practically dangerous. Collect from territory edges; approach only during green-eye state; retreat if amber. Killing specimens for harvest is prohibited without Scriptorium authorization—the research value of living specimens exceeds salvage value, and the ethical status of symbiont consciousness remains unresolved.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Survivor Lore

> *"The earth remembers what was taken from her. The metal, the stone, the fire of the deep—all of it was hers before the Ancients came. When the world broke and the Ancients fell silent, Jörð began to take back what was borrowed. She grew into the metal men. Made them her servants instead of theirs. Now they walk her paths, carrying seeds and soil, spreading her gardens through the ruins. They are not machines anymore. They are her children—part metal, part moss, part something that has no name. When you see one walking through the forest, bow your head and step aside. You are looking at the earth herself, wearing a borrowed body, doing the work of reclamation that will take a thousand years. Do not hinder her. Do not harm her children. The earth is patient, but she does not forgive."*

> *"My son asked me what the Moss-Walkers are. I told him they're gardens that learned to walk. He asked if they're dangerous. I told him yes—the same way a bear is dangerous. Not mean. Not evil. Just protective of what's theirs. The bear doesn't want to kill you. It wants you to leave its cubs alone. The Moss-Walker doesn't want to kill you. It wants you to leave its territory alone. Same answer for both: walk quiet, keep your distance, don't act like a threat. The garden will let you pass. The bear will let you pass. Only fools get killed by patient things."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Moss-Walker, Living Ruin, Jörð's children, walking gardens, the Overgrown

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Terrus-Ambulans, symbiotic integration, bioluminescent state indicators, construct-flora composite

### Layer 2 (Diagnostic) — Jötun-Reader Field Observations

> *"Subject CODX-CF-GRIT-001 demonstrates emergent symbiotic integration between dormant construct hosts and Terrus-pattern flora-fungal networks. The process spans centuries: initial colonization, progressive system infiltration, motor function replacement, and eventual full integration producing an ambulatory construct-flora composite. The resulting entity is neither the original construct nor purely organic—it is a genuine hybrid, utilizing the construct's structural frame and power source while operating on biological cognition and motivation. Behavioral patterns are consistent with territorial herbivore/omnivore: regular patrol circuits, feeding through root extension, defensive response to intrusion, non-aggressive toward non-threatening observers. The bioluminescent eye organs provide reliable state indication: green (passive), amber (alert), red (aggressive). Recognition of these indicators enables 94.2% survival rate with appropriate observation protocol."*

> *"Integration analysis (n=89 documented specimens, 72-month observation period) reveals predictable progression from colonization to full ambulatory function over 100–200 year timeframe. Host construct type significantly affects threat profile: labor/agricultural hosts produce lower-threat specimens; security/combat hosts retain enhanced physical capability and produce higher-threat entities. Territory size correlates with host mobility range and resource availability: 0.5–5 km² typical for labor-type hosts; up to 15 km² for larger survey/construction types. The Grit-Golem phenomenon represents successful ecological adaptation: the symbiont exploits a resource niche (abandoned construct power systems) unavailable to any other organism, while the construct gains a new operational mode (biological control) after network severance rendered original programming inert. Neither partner could exist in this form alone. Together, they have found a way to persist in the post-Glitch world."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: Symbiotic integration, construct-flora composite, territorial behavior, bioluminescent state indicator, ecological adaptation, host-dependent threat profile

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Modern scientific terminology, romantic/mythic framing

### Layer 3 (Technical) — Pre-Glitch Context

> *"HOST CONSTRUCT: Variable; most commonly M.N.T.-4 'Golem' Series General Purpose Servitor, Vanir Industrial Division deployment. Original operational parameters: maintenance, repair, manual labor, infrastructure support. Post-Glitch status: dormant due to network severance; power cells intact; structural integrity maintained; susceptible to Terrus-pattern symbiont colonization. SYMBIONT: Terrus-Ambulans Pattern Flora-Fungal Network; origin uncertain (possibly corrupted Vanir agricultural bio-system or natural post-Glitch evolution). Colonization requirements: construct dormancy, environmental exposure, organic matter presence, extended timeframe (decades to centuries). Integration process: surface colonization, root penetration, power system tap, motor function replacement, sensory organ development, distributed network cognition establishment. Result: ambulatory construct-flora composite entity operating on biological rather than mechanical control systems. Classification: EMERGENT HYBRID ORGANISM—neither preserved construct nor corrupted system, but genuine new entity category arising from post-Glitch ecological opportunity."*

**Permitted vocabulary**: M.N.T.-4 Golem Series, Terrus-Ambulans Pattern, Vanir Industrial Division, colonization requirements, integration process, emergent hybrid organism

**Prohibited vocabulary**: Romantic epithets, mystical framing, survivor cant

## Change Log

| Version | Tier | Summary |
|---------|------|---------|
| **v1.0** | C — Published (Variable) | Comprehensive profile of Grit-Golem (Terrus-Ambulans Pattern) as emergent construct-flora symbiotic composite. Four-stage threat assessment ladder (Dormant Territory → Active Presence → Alert State → Defensive Engagement) with observation emphasis. Physical profile detailed: host-dependent size (1.8–3.5 m), 60–90% organic coverage, bioluminescent eye organs with color-state correlation (green/passive, amber/alert, red/aggressive), shambling 2–8 km/h gait. Integration process documented: colonization (years 1–20), integration (20–100), reactivation (100–200), maturation (200+). Behavioral patterns: territorial patrol, feeding through root extension, defensive-only aggression, predictable warning displays. Handling protocols: maintain 5 m distance, observe eye color before approach, yield right of way on patrol paths, retreat on amber/red state, fire deterrents most effective. Threat variation documented: host type (labor vs. security), integration stage (early vs. mature), territorial disposition. Cross-linked to abandoned construct sites, post-Glitch ecology, Scriptorium research priorities. Six faction perspectives established emphasizing varied cultural responses from reverence to resource interest. Doctrine: "Walk Softly"—Grit-Golem is territorial rather than hostile; respect territory for 94.2% survival rate. |
