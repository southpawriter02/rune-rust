## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Analyze Weakness is the Jötun-Reader's **primary combat-utility tool**—the act of intellectual deconstruction. They focus their scholarly intellect on a foe, cross-referencing real-time observations with their vast internal library to pinpoint exploitable flaws.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Reveal enemy Resistances and Vulnerabilities
- **Secondary:** Enable follow-up abilities (Exploit Design Flaw)
- **Cost:** Stamina + Psychic Stress (Trauma Economy participation)
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The analyst who sees weakness where others see only threat

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** High (information is tactical advantage)
- **Skill Check Required:** Success not guaranteed vs high-DC enemies
- **Stress Cost:** Repeated use taxes mental health
- **Setup Role:** Enables party-wide damage optimization

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Jötun-Reader focuses their keen intellect on a single foe. Their mind races—processing movements, material composition, energy signatures. They cross-reference this data with their vast library of pre-crash anatomy, engineering, and metaphysical theory.

There. A flaw in the armor's stress distribution. A hesitation in the attack pattern that suggests damaged servos. The information crystallizes into actionable intelligence.

*"The plating is thick, but it reacts poorly to corrosive agents. Aim for the third thoracic junction."*

### Thematic Resonance

Analyze Weakness transforms the Jötun-Reader from observer to force multiplier—proof that the right information is worth more than brute strength.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Activation

- **Action Type:** Standard Action
- **Cost:** 40 Stamina
- **Range:** Visual range (ranged)
- **Target:** Single enemy

### WITS Check

**Opposed Check:** WITS vs target's Analysis DC

- **Analysis DC:** Hidden stat based on creature complexity (common enemy: DC 3, legendary boss: DC 7+)

### Results

| Result | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Failure** | No useful information; Stress still applies |
| **Success** | Reveal ONE Resistance and ONE Vulnerability |
| **Critical Success** | Reveal ALL Resistances/Vulnerabilities + AI Archetype hint |

### Trauma Economy

- **Psychic Stress:** 5 Stress on use (success or failure)
- Interfacing with corrupted entity data is mentally taxing

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Cost Payment:** Spend 40 Stamina
2. **WITS Check:** Roll vs target's Analysis DC
3. **Information Reveal:** Based on success tier
4. **Journal Update:** Information permanently recorded in Bestiary
5. **Stress Application:** Apply 5 Psychic Stress to Jötun-Reader

---

## IV. Progression Path

### Rank 1 (Base — This Ability)

- Reveal 1 Resistance + 1 Vulnerability on success
- Cost: 40 Stamina + 5 Stress

### Rank 2 (Expert — 20 PP)

- As Rank 1
- Cost reduced: 30 Stamina + 5 Stress
- **New:** +1 bonus die to Analysis check

### Rank 3 (Mastery — Capstone)

- Reveal ALL on success (not just critical)
- Cost: 30 Stamina + 3 Stress
- +2 bonus dice to Analysis check
- **New:** Critical Success also applies [Analyzed] debuff for 2 rounds

---

## V. Tactical Applications

1. **Damage Optimization:** Party can target Vulnerabilities, avoid Resistances
2. **Boss Fights:** Critical for complex resistance profiles
3. **Setup:** Enables Exploit Design Flaw follow-up
4. **Permanent Value:** Information saved to Bestiary for future encounters
5. **AI Prediction:** Critical success reveals enemy behavior patterns

---

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Exploit Design Flaw (Tier 2):** Requires successful Analyze first
- **Party damage dealers:** Everyone benefits from knowing Vulnerabilities
- **Bone-Setter/Skald:** Stress mitigation enables repeated use
- **Elemental specialists:** Know which damage types to use

### Negative Synergies

- **Short encounters:** Setup cost not worth it for trash mobs
- **No Stress management:** Risk of Breakdown from repeated use
- **Low WITS:** Unreliable against high-DC targets
