## Description

You have studied the Runic Blight for so long that you can predict its chaotic influence with uncanny accuracy. You understand that a more corrupted creature is also more unstable—its form less coherent, its logic more paradoxical, its structural integrity compromised by cascading errors. You have learned to identify these critical points of failure and strike them with surgical precision, triggering catastrophic system collapses.

## Mechanics

### Critical Hit Bonus Scaling

Based on target's hidden Corruption score:

| Corruption Level | Range | Crit Bonus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Low** | 0-25 | +5% |
| **Medium** | 26-50 | +10% |
| **High** | 51-75 | +20% |
| **Extreme** | 76-100 | +30% |

### Application

- Applies to **ALL** your attacks (Aimed Shot, Blight-Tipped Arrow, Heartseeker Shot)
- Stacks with all other critical hit modifiers
- The more corrupted your prey, the more vulnerable it becomes

### Thematic

You're not just shooting at physical weak points—you're targeting logical flaws in corrupted code. A highly Blighted creature is a glitching system full of exploitable vulnerabilities. Your arrows find those errors and execute them.

## Tactical Applications

1. **Boss Killer:** Most dangerous enemies have high corruption, making you ideal for boss fights
2. **Universal Benefit:** Every attack you make benefits from this passive
3. **Information Synergy:** At Capstone, you can see corruption levels, letting you prioritize high-corruption targets
4. **Stacking Multipliers:** Combined with Mark for Death, you become an execution machine

## Integration Notes

- **Core Identity:** This defines you as the Blight-Stalker—the hunter who specializes in corrupted prey
- **Defining Passive:** Makes you exponentially more dangerous against the most corrupted enemies
- **Synergy Focus:** Every other Veiðimaðr ability benefits from this foundation
