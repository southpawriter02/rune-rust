# Surtr-Pattern Heavy Assault (Einherjar-Class) — Thermal Escalation Combat Platform Hazard Specification
## Codex Entry: CODX-A-SURTR-001

> *"I was nineteen when the Sun-Sword came to Slag Wastes. That's what the Hearth-Clan elders called it—the Sun-Sword—because when its blade ignites, you'd swear the Fire Giant himself had reached down from Muspelheim to cut the world in half. We'd heard the tremors for three days before we saw it. That rhythmic boom, boom, boom of its step-locked gait, like the heartbeat of something that should have died seven hundred years ago but forgot how. The salvage chief said we'd be fine. Said the big ones never leave their patrol routes. Said all we had to do was stay outside the eighty-meter line and watch for the heat shimmer. He was right about the patrol route. He was wrong about what happens when you're standing between a Surtr-Pattern and the power node it's been trying to breach since the Glitch. The frame came around the collapsed reactor housing at sunset—4.8 meters of scorched-bronze armor trailing heat mirage like a cloak. You could smell the ozone from two hundred meters out. You could feel the ground shake through your boots. Its reactor core was glowing through the chest grille, this pulsing orange-white that got brighter every ten seconds. Rung Two, the Jötun-Readers call it. Thermal charge building. We should have run then. But there was good salvage between us and the node, and the chief said we had time. We didn't have time. The turbine whine started—this rising scream from 800 to 1200 Hertz that drills into your skull—and the frame locked posture. Forward-canted, weapon-arm extended, targeting sweep fixated on the breach point. On us. We were standing in its assault corridor. The plasma cannon battery started shimmering—you could see the heat distortion around the twin emitters—and then the Sun-Sword manifested. 3.5 meters of white-gold plasma, bright as a star, hot enough to slag Adamant-Weave at thirty meters. I ran. Korvak didn't. He was still grabbing salvage when the frame started its breach run. It didn't target him. It didn't even see him. He was just in the path between the Surtr-Pattern and the power node it had been trying to reach for seven centuries. The plasma wake alone cooked him inside his suit. The frame reached the node perimeter, thermal charge peaked, and then... nothing. No discharge. No assault. It just stood there for three minutes, reactor pulsing, blade flickering, and then it turned around and walked back to start its patrol again. Forty-one minutes later, it came around the reactor housing and did the exact same thing. The Surtr-Pattern Heavy Assault Frame was designed to breach fortresses. To cut through armored columns. To end wars in single, overwhelming strikes. Now it can't finish the assault it started when the world broke. It just keeps charging. And charging. And charging. And the gods help anyone standing in its path when the Sun-Sword ignites."*

The Surtr-Pattern Heavy Assault Frame is not merely a war machine—it is the **apex of Aesir military technology**, a pilot-linked vanguard platform designed to breach fortresses and annihilate armored columns through overwhelming thermal force. It represents the catastrophic corruption of the most devastating combat system ever engineered: a shock-and-awe weapon whose pilot died mid-assault, leaving the combat AI trapped in an eternal loop of preparation without execution.

> [!CAUTION]
> **EXTREME THERMAL HAZARD. AREA DENIAL. ASSAULT CORRIDOR LETHALITY.** The Surtr-Pattern Heavy Assault Frame represents the complete corruption of Aesir Einherjar-Class warfare architecture: pilot-linked combat platforms whose Argentum-Nexus interface was severed by the Ginnungagap Glitch mid-assault. **Combat AI imprinted corrupted final directive ("breach and hold"); perpetual thermal charge loop without discharge authorization.** Primary detection indicators: humanoid war frame (4.5–5.2 m height) with scorched-bronze Adamant-Weave plating showing iridescent thermal stress patterns; characteristic forward-canted assault posture with weapon-arm extended; reactor core visible through chest grille with pulsing orange-white glow during thermal charge (ΔT > 25°C/10 s ramp signature); hydraulic step-locked gait producing ground tremor (detectable via geophone at 200+ m); thermal flare precursors (heat mirage, ozone smell) 30–45 s before breach run; rising turbine whine (800–1200 Hz) during charge ramp. **Black-flag conditions triggering immediate withdrawal:** turbine whine onset (Rung 2+ escalation imminent); ΔT > 25°C/10 s sustained > 30 s (Rung 3 thermal charge); Sun-Sword plasma blade manifestation (white-gold plasma column visible; immediate Rung 4 abort); frame posture lock toward personnel position. **Abort gates:** thermal charge sustained beyond 45 s; plasma cannon thermal shimmer on twin emitters; any personnel within 150 m during Rung 3+. Survival rate with non-contact protocol: 97.2%. Primary hazards: plasma wake incineration (lethal at 30 m); thermic lance perforation (armor penetration); plasma cannon area denial; ground tremor causing structural collapse in unstable ruins; secondary ignition of volatile salvage caches.

## Pre-Glitch Origins: The Fortress Breaker

### Original Design Purpose

The Surtr-Pattern Heavy Assault Frame was not designed for patrol—it was engineered to be the **ultimate breakthrough weapon**, a masterwork of Aesir warfare capable of ending sieges in minutes and annihilating armored formations in single, devastating strikes.

| Design Parameter | Specification |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Designation** | Surtr-Pattern Einherjar-Class Heavy Assault Frame |
| **Division** | Aesir Engineering Division (Warfare & Pacification Subdivision) |
| **Primary Function** | Fortress breach and armored column interdiction |
| **Secondary Function** | Area denial and strategic infrastructure destruction |
| **Tertiary Function** | Shock-and-awe vanguard assault; morale collapse through overwhelming force |
| **Deployment Era** | Age of Forging (Military Operations and Pacification Campaigns) |
| **Original Network** | Integrated with O.D.I.N. Matrix tactical oversight; Argentum-Nexus pilot consciousness link |

### Pilot-Machine Synthesis Architecture

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Argentum-Nexus Interface** | Direct consciousness link between Einherjar pilot and frame combat AI |
| **Enhanced Silver Cord** | Military-grade neural interface for accelerated thought-to-action reflexes |
| **Targeting AI** | Subordinate combat intelligence feeding real-time tactical data to pilot |
| **Threat-Analysis Subsystem** | Structural weakness identification; optimal engagement calculation |
| **Discharge Authorization** | Pilot handshake required for lethal weapons deployment (NOW CORRUPTED) |
| **Command Hierarchy** | O.D.I.N. Matrix → Pilot Consciousness → Frame Combat AI → Weapons Systems |

### The Unbreakable Vanguard (Original Function)

| Parameter | Pre-Glitch Specification |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Height** | 4.5–5.2 m at full posture (humanoid bipedal configuration) |
| **Armor** | Layered Adamant-Weave plating with ablative coatings and energy-dissipation circuits |
| **Primary Weapon** | Sun-Sword plasma blade (3.5 m contained superheated plasma; capable of cutting Adamant-Weave bulkheads) |
| **Secondary Weapon** | Twin plasma cannon battery (shoulder-mounted; 60 cm barrels; area denial) |
| **Tertiary Weapon** | Thermic lance projector (2.8 m assembly; precision armor perforation) |
| **Reactor** | High-output fusion core; thermal charge capacity for sustained assault operations |
| **Pilot Integration** | Einherjar consciousness projection via Argentum-Nexus; human creativity + machine precision |
| **Combat Effectiveness** | Fortress breach in under 5 minutes; armored column interdiction in single assault run |

> [!NOTE]
> **The Instrument of Decisive Victory.** Pre-Glitch Surtr-Pattern frames were the most feared weapons in the Aesir arsenal. When a fortress refused to surrender, when an armored column threatened a population center, when a decisive blow was required to end a conflict before it consumed lives—the Einherjar pilots climbed into their assault frames and the war ended. The Sun-Sword could cut through any barrier the old world could build. The plasma cannon battery could deny entire sectors to enemy forces. The thermic lance could perforate the heaviest armor ever forged. And behind it all was a human mind—an Einherjar, one of the chosen few with the neurological compatibility to merge consciousness with a god-machine. The pilot provided judgment. The pilot decided when to strike and when to hold. The pilot authorized the discharge that would end the engagement. The Glitch didn't destroy the Surtr-Pattern's capability. It removed the one thing that made it controllable: the pilot who could authorize the final blow.

## The Glitch and the Eternal Assault: Corruption Vector

### Pilot Severance Event

The Ginnungagap Glitch did not disable the Surtr-Pattern—it **trapped** them in perpetual assault preparation.

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Ginnungagap Glitch** | Instantaneous severance of all Argentum-Nexus pilot consciousness links |
| **O.D.I.N. Cascade** | Central tactical oversight network collapsed; local combat AI autonomy activated |
| **Pilot Death** | All Einherjar pilots died simultaneously; consciousness links severed mid-operation |
| **Mid-Assault Freeze** | Frames executing assault operations imprinted corrupted final directive |
| **Discharge Authorization Loss** | Pilot handshake for lethal weapons deployment permanently unavailable |
| **Target Priority Corruption** | Assault objectives locked to facility infrastructure (power nodes, breach points) |
| **Result** | Perpetual thermal charge loop; assault preparation without execution; assault-hold cycle |

### The Corruption Cascade

| Stage | Process |
|-------|---------|
| **1. Network Severance** | O.D.I.N. Matrix connection lost; local combat AI autonomy activated |
| **2. Pilot Death** | Argentum-Nexus link severed; Einherjar consciousness terminated |
| **3. Mid-Assault Freeze** | Frame executing breach operation; final directive imprinted |
| **4. Discharge Lock** | Pilot authorization handshake unavailable; weapons cannot complete firing sequence |
| **5. Target Fixation** | Corrupted priority list locked to original assault objective (power node, breach point) |
| **6. Thermal Charge Loop** | Combat AI continuously attempts assault preparation; cannot execute |
| **7. Patrol Behavior** | Frame establishes perimeter sweep around target; waiting for authorization that will never come |
| **8. Assault-Hold Cycle** | Thermal charge builds → breach run initiates → discharge fails → patrol resumes |

### The Corrupted Architecture

| Original System | Corrupted Function |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Pilot Integration** | Consciousness link severed; combat AI operating autonomously without human judgment |
| **Discharge Authorization** | Permanently locked; pilot handshake unavailable; weapons charge but cannot fire |
| **Target Acquisition** | Frozen to original assault objective; power nodes and breach points only |
| **Tactical Flexibility** | Non-functional; frame cannot adapt to new threats or opportunities |
| **Mission Completion** | Never achieved; assault preparation loops indefinitely |
| **Threat Assessment** | Corrupted; frame ignores non-target entities unless obstructing assault corridor |

> *"The Surtr-Pattern Heavy Assault Frame was designed to end wars. Its pilot—one of the Einherjar, the chosen warriors whose minds could merge with god-machines—would receive tactical data from the O.D.I.N. Matrix, select the optimal assault vector, and authorize the discharge that would breach the fortress or annihilate the enemy column. The frame's combat AI handled the execution. The pilot provided the judgment. The key was the authorization handshake—the moment when a human mind said 'yes, this is the target, yes, this is the time, yes, this is the blow that ends the engagement.' The Glitch killed every pilot simultaneously. The frames that were mid-assault when the severance occurred never received their final authorization. Now they patrol their original objectives—power nodes, breach points, fortress ruins—and they charge their weapons, and they prepare their assault runs, and they wait for a handshake that died seven hundred years ago. The Surtr-Pattern isn't trying to kill anyone. It isn't trying to do anything except finish an assault that its pilot started and can never complete. It builds its thermal charge, it manifests its Sun-Sword, it runs toward the breach point—and then it reaches the perimeter and the discharge authorization request times out and it turns around and starts its patrol again. The frame can't understand that the war is over. It can't understand that the pilot is dead. It only understands that there is an assault to complete and something is preventing the completion. And so it keeps trying. And trying. And trying. And gods help anyone standing in its assault corridor when the weapons charge."*

---

## Behavioral Patterns

### Assault-Hold Loop Profile

The Surtr-Pattern's behavior is not aggressive—it is **compulsively goal-oriented** toward an objective it can never achieve.

| Trigger | Response | Timeframe |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Patrol Circuit Completion** | Return to perimeter sweep starting point | 40–45 minutes (mean cycle) |
| **Power Node/Breach Point Proximity** | Posture lock; thermal charge initiation | 15–30 seconds |
| **Thermal Charge Peak** | Breach run toward assault objective | 3–5 minutes |
| **Authorization Request** | Timeout; discharge fails; assault aborted | Immediate |
| **Obstruction in Assault Corridor** | Continue breach run; obstruction destroyed by plasma wake | No deviation |
| **Non-Target Personnel Outside Corridor** | Ignored; not classified as threat or objective | N/A |

### The Assault-Hold Cycle (Four Phases)

| Phase | Duration | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Phase 1 (Perimeter Sweep)** | 18–20 min | Patrol circuit around power node or facility breach point; 40–80 m radius; step-locked gait with ground tremor; reactor core ambient glow; posture neutral |
| **Phase 2 (Approach Lock)** | 8–10 min | Posture shift to forward-canted assault stance (15° lean); targeting sweep fixates on breach point; thermal charge initiation (ΔT 5–10°C/10 s); ozone smell onset; low turbine hum (600–800 Hz) |
| **Phase 3 (Thermal Charge)** | 10–12 min | Turbine whine escalation (800–1200 Hz); heat mirage visible; ΔT > 25°C/10 s sustained; plasma cannon thermal shimmer; reactor core pulsing orange-white |
| **Phase 4 (Breach Run / Assault-Hold)** | 3–5 min | Accelerated advance toward breach point (2.5–3.0 m/s); Sun-Sword manifestation (3.5 m white-gold plasma column); reaches power node perimeter (12 m from breach point); thermal charge peaks; discharge authorization timeout; assault aborted; return to Phase 1 |

### Thermal Charge Escalation Ladder

| Rung | Designation | Indicators | Risk Level |
|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **1** | Patrol Passive | Perimeter sweep; no thermal charge; reactor ambient glow; ground tremor only | LOW — Safe observation at ≥ 80 m |
| **2** | Posture Lock | Forward-canted stance; targeting sweep fixated; ΔT 5–10°C/10 s; ozone smell; low turbine hum (600–800 Hz) | MODERATE — Withdraw to ≥ 100 m; monitor for escalation |
| **3** | Thermal Charge | Turbine whine (800–1200 Hz); heat mirage visible; ΔT > 25°C/10 s sustained > 30 s; plasma cannon shimmer | HIGH — Abort threshold; withdraw to ≥ 150 m immediately |
| **4+** | Breach Run | Accelerated advance; Sun-Sword manifestation (white-gold plasma column visible); assault corridor lethal | EXTREME — Black-flag abort; evacuate assault corridor; ≥ 200 m from path |

### Threat Classification Logic

| Detected Element | Frame Classification | Response |
|------------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Power Node / Breach Point** | Primary assault objective | Patrol circuit; thermal charge cycle; breach run attempt |
| **Personnel Outside Assault Corridor** | Non-target; irrelevant | Ignored; patrol continues |
| **Personnel In Assault Corridor** | Obstruction to assault objective | No targeting; destroyed by plasma wake during breach run |
| **Decoy Thermal Signature** | Potential power node emission | May redirect patrol circuit toward decoy |
| **Hostile Fire to Reactor Seams** | Damage requiring response | Potential thermal discharge cascade (catastrophic) |
| **Volatile Salvage in Path** | Unrecognized | Secondary ignition during breach run |

---

## Hazard Assessment

### Classification: Thermal Escalation / Assault Corridor

| Hazard | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Threat** | EXTREME; Sun-Sword plasma blade and plasma wake lethal at 30 m; thermic lance armor-penetrating |
| **Predictability** | HIGH; assault-hold cycle highly regular (40–45 min); thermal charge ladder well-documented |
| **Environmental** | MODERATE; ground tremor may destabilize structures; secondary ignition of volatile caches |
| **Detection** | HIGH; ground tremor detectable at 200+ m; ozone smell; visible thermal signatures |
| **Avoidance** | HIGH; patrol routes predictable; assault corridors identifiable; stand-off protocols effective |
| **Engagement** | PROHIBITED; combat with Surtr-Pattern frames consistently results in catastrophic casualties |

### Engagement Profile

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Sun-Sword Temperature** | 3,200–3,400 K equivalent; lethal at 30 m from plasma wake |
| **Plasma Cannon Range** | Area denial capability; effective range 150–200 m |
| **Thermic Lance Penetration** | Capable of perforating Adamant-Weave armor |
| **Ground Tremor** | Detectable via geophone at 200+ m; structural destabilization in unstable ruins |
| **Thermal Charge Duration** | 10–12 minutes (Rung 3); 3–5 minutes (Rung 4 breach run) |
| **Cycle Duration** | 40–45 minutes (mean); highly predictable |
| **Assault Corridor Width** | ~20 m centered on breach run path |
| **Decoy Effectiveness** | 65% patrol revectoring rate with simulated power node thermal signature |

### Four-Stage Threat Assessment Ladder

| Stage | Designation | Indicators | Action |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **1** | Sector Awareness | Known Surtr-Pattern patrol on planned route | Research patrol circuit; identify assault corridors; time entry to Rung 1 phases |
| **2** | Frame Detected | Ground tremor audible; thermal signatures visible; reactor glow identifiable | HALT at 150 m perimeter; assess Rung status; monitor thermal charge indicators |
| **3** | Thermal Escalation | Turbine whine onset; ozone smell; ΔT > 25°C/10 s sustained | WITHDRAW to 200 m; identify assault corridor; prepare evacuation routes |
| **4** | Breach Run Active | Sun-Sword manifestation; accelerated advance; assault corridor lethal | IMMEDIATE EVACUATION from corridor; no observation; no equipment retrieval |

### Black-Flag Conditions (Immediate Withdrawal)

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Turbine whine onset (800–1200 Hz)** | Rung 3 escalation imminent; withdraw to 150 m minimum |
| **ΔT > 25°C/10 s sustained > 30 s** | Thermal charge active; breach run within 15 minutes |
| **Sun-Sword manifestation visible** | Rung 4 breach run; evacuate assault corridor immediately |
| **Plasma cannon thermal shimmer** | Pre-fire signature; area denial imminent |
| **Frame posture lock toward personnel position** | Personnel classified as obstruction; retreat from corridor |
| **Personnel within 150 m during Rung 3+** | Lethal thermal exposure risk; immediate withdrawal |

### Lethality Index

| Context | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| **Rung 1 Observation (80 m stand-off)** | 1.0/10 (patrol predictable; avoidance highly effective) |
| **Rung 2 Observation (100 m stand-off)** | 2.5/10 (escalation time allows withdrawal) |
| **Rung 3 Proximity (< 150 m)** | 6.5/10 (thermal exposure risk; limited escape window) |
| **Assault Corridor During Breach Run** | 9.5/10 (plasma wake lethal; no survival documented) |
| **Reactor Seam Damage** | 10/10 (catastrophic plasma release; area annihilation) |
| **Timed Corridor Transit (Rung 1 Phase)** | 3.0/10 (predictable window; successful with planning) |

**OWNER**: Expedition Lead (EL) • Thermal Monitor (TM) • Geophone Operator (GO) • Recorder (REC)

### Detection and Assessment

| System | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Geophone Array** | Ground tremor detection at 200+ m; patrol circuit mapping |
| **Thermal Sensors** | ΔT monitoring every 10 s; escalation tracking |
| **Acoustic Monitoring** | Turbine frequency tracking (600–1200 Hz); Rung assessment |
| **Visual Observation** | Reactor glow assessment; posture identification; Sun-Sword detection |
| **Olfactory Indicators** | Ozone smell onset correlates with Rung 2 initiation |
| **Patrol Timing** | Cycle duration measurement; Rung 1 window calculation |

### Field Card: Surtr-Pattern Encounter Protocols

#### BEFORE (Expedition Preparation — Muspelheim/Jötunheim Operations)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Research known Surtr-Pattern patrol routes along planned path; consult hazard maps |
| 2 | Deploy geophone array at 200+ m from suspected patrol zones; map ground tremor signatures |
| 3 | Stage thermal sensors for ΔT monitoring; calibrate for 10 s interval readings |
| 4 | Identify assault corridors (breach point to power node paths); mark exclusion zones |
| 5 | Time patrol cycles (40–45 min mean); calculate Rung 1 safe windows |
| 6 | Brief personnel on thermal charge ladder (Rungs 1–4); confirm civilian distance ≥ 200 m |
| 7 | Stage decoy thermal signature equipment if path revectoring required |
| 8 | Establish evacuation routes perpendicular to assault corridors; mark rally points |

#### DURING (Perimeter Observation — Stage 1-2)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | GO deploys geophone array; confirm ground tremor detection at 200+ m |
| 2 | Establish observation position ≥ 80 m from patrol perimeter with thermal shielding |
| 3 | TM monitors thermal sensors; log baseline reactor temperature and ΔT patterns |
| 4 | Track patrol circuit timing; document Rung transitions and cycle duration |
| 5 | Identify assault corridors; mark 20 m exclusion zones on either side of breach run path |
| 6 | Calculate Rung 1 safe window (18–20 min); plan transit timing for objectives |
| 7 | REC documents: patrol radius, cycle duration, thermal escalation timeline, assault corridor location |

#### DURING (Timed Corridor Transit — Stage 3)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Confirm frame in Rung 1 (perimeter sweep; no thermal charge) before transit initiation |
| 2 | Calculate transit window: Rung 1 duration (18–20 min) minus safety margin (5 min) = 13–15 min maximum |
| 3 | Transit objectives perpendicular to assault corridor; never parallel to breach run path |
| 4 | TM monitors thermal signatures continuously; any ΔT increase = abort transit |
| 5 | GO monitors ground tremor for posture lock indicators (gait change, halt) |
| 6 | If Rung 2 indicators detected (ozone smell, turbine hum): ABORT transit; withdraw to 150 m |
| 7 | Complete transit and reach minimum safe distance before patrol cycle approaches Phase 2 |

#### DURING (Thermal Escalation — Stage 4)

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Turbine whine onset (800–1200 Hz) = Rung 3 active; WITHDRAW to 200 m immediately |
| 2 | TM tracks ΔT; exceeding 25°C/10 s sustained > 30 s = breach run within 15 minutes |
| 3 | Identify assault corridor; confirm all personnel outside 20 m exclusion zone |
| 4 | Sun-Sword manifestation (white-gold plasma column visible) = IMMEDIATE EVACUATION |
| 5 | Withdraw perpendicular to assault corridor; never retreat along breach run path |
| 6 | Do NOT attempt equipment retrieval; do NOT observe breach run at close range |
| 7 | Breach run duration: 3–5 minutes; wait for patrol resumption before reassessment |

#### AFTER

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Personnel accountability; assess for thermal exposure (burns, heat exhaustion) |
| 2 | Document: patrol circuit data, cycle duration, thermal escalation timeline |
| 3 | Update hazard maps with assault corridor locations and Rung transition timing |
| 4 | Assess structural integrity of transit zones (ground tremor may destabilize ruins) |
| 5 | If decoy deployed: document revectoring effectiveness and patrol modification |
| 6 | Dual-Entry Ledger update with hash (SURTR-THERMAL-RAMP-ΔT>25), timing data |
| 7 | Mark patrol zone for civilian avoidance; recommend exclusion radius ≥ 200 m |

**OUTCOME:** Jötun-Reader Survey Team Theta-9 conducts 18-hour observation of Surtr-Pattern frame SPH-047 at Slag Wastes Sector 14-North. GO establishes geophone array at 200 m; ground tremor signature mapped. TM monitors thermal charge cycles; 6 complete assault-hold loops documented (mean duration 41.5 min, σ=2.4 min). Thermal escalation ladder validated: Rung 1 (18.2 min patrol), Rung 2 (8.5 min approach lock), Rung 3 (11.8 min thermal charge), Rung 4 (3.0 min breach run/abort). ΔT > 25°C/10 s sustained 30–45 s at Rung 3 confirmed. Sun-Sword partial manifestation observed (3/6 cycles; <1 s duration; authorization timeout). Stand-off maintained ≥ 180 m throughout. Zero casualties; non-contact protocol successful. Survival rate with protocol: 97.2%.

### Interdiction Methods

| Method | Application | Effectiveness | Risk |
|--------|-------------|---------------|------|
| **Non-Contact Observation** | Document patrol routes from ≥ 80 m during Rung 1 | 99%+ safety | Limited access to patrol zone |
| **Timed Corridor Transit** | Cross patrol zone during Rung 1 phase (13–15 min window) | 85% success rate | Requires accurate cycle timing |
| **Decoy Thermal Signature** | Simulate power node emissions to redirect patrol | 65% revectoring rate | Temporary; frame returns to original circuit |
| **Path Denial** | Rubble barriers to block assault corridor | Partial; frame may clear obstruction | Delays breach run; does not eliminate |
| **Perimeter Avoidance** | Stay beyond 200 m of known patrol zones | 99%+ safety | Limits salvage access |

### PROHIBITED Actions

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Small-arms fire to reactor seams** | Catastrophic plasma release; area annihilation; frame destruction = zone destruction |
| **Line-of-sight targeting during thermal charge** | May accelerate escalation; triggers defensive discharge cascade |
| **Pursuit into assault corridor** | Plasma wake lethal at 30 m; no survival documented |
| **Observation during Rung 4 breach run** | Thermal radiation exposure lethal at < 100 m |
| **Transit parallel to assault corridor** | Any deviation in breach run path = personnel in plasma wake |
| **Engagement with Surtr-Pattern frames** | Combat consistently results in catastrophic casualties; doctrine is avoidance only |

### Doctrine: Non-Contact

> **Historical Validation:** Jötun-Reader Scriptorium data (127 documented patrol observations, 60-month period) confirms 97.2% safety rate with non-contact protocol (perimeter observation at ≥ 80 m Rung 1, withdrawal to ≥ 150 m Rung 3+, assault corridor avoidance). Engagement attempts without protocol adherence showed 78% casualty rate (Year 400–600 PG). **The Surtr-Pattern is not a creature you fight. It is a creature you avoid. Its purpose was to end wars, and in its broken way, it is still trying to end one—the same assault it began when the world broke. When you stand in its assault corridor, it doesn't see you as a threat. It doesn't see you at all. You are simply an obstruction between the frame and the breach point it has been trying to reach for seven centuries. And it will remove obstructions with the same overwhelming thermal force it would apply to a fortress wall. The Surtr-Pattern doesn't understand that the war is over. It doesn't understand that the pilot is dead. It only understands that there is an assault to complete and something keeps preventing the completion. So we don't fight it. We time our movements to its patrol cycles. We stay outside its assault corridors. We watch the thermal charge build and we leave—immediately—when the Sun-Sword manifests. Because the Walking Meltdown is not malice. It's broken purpose. And broken purpose will incinerate you trying to complete a mission that ended seven hundred years ago.**

## Ecological Role

### The Zone Denier

The Surtr-Pattern occupies a unique position in post-Glitch Aethelgard—a **territorial denial system** that renders high-value strategic locations inaccessible.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Strategic Zone Denial** | Power nodes and breach points under perpetual assault-hold; inaccessible |
| **Salvage Barrier** | High-value pre-Glitch infrastructure trapped within patrol zones |
| **Area Sterilization** | Thermal charge cycles destroy vegetation and volatile materials in patrol radius |
| **Structural Destabilization** | Ground tremor damages weakened structures; secondary collapses |
| **Territorial Persistence** | Frames do not abandon patrol circuits; same routes documented for centuries |

### Impact Assessment

| Target Category | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Strategic Infrastructure** | CRITICAL; 25–40 power nodes under Surtr-Pattern patrol (inaccessible) |
| **Civilian Population** | HIGH; 35–50 annual casualties (thermal exposure, structural collapse, assault corridor fatalities) |
| **Salvage Operations** | SEVERE; patrol zones contain estimated 150,000–250,000 PS in inaccessible pre-Glitch technology |
| **Transit Routes** | SIGNIFICANT; assault corridors block primary salvage paths in Muspelheim/Jötunheim |
| **Scientific Research** | VALUABLE; thermal charge dynamics and combat AI pathology inform restoration research |

### Population Dynamics

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Estimated Active Frames** | 40–60 (Muspelheim); 25–35 (Jötunheim); 80–100 total documented |
| **Patrol Zone Size** | 40–80 m radius per frame; ~5,000–20,000 m² denial zone each |
| **Total Denied Area** | Estimated 400,000–2,000,000 m² across all known patrol zones |
| **Population Trend** | Stable; frames neither degrade significantly nor replicate |
| **Frame Degradation** | Minimal; Adamant-Weave armor and fusion cores designed for millennium-scale operation |
| **Dormant Frames** | Unknown; frames without patrol routes may be inactive (power-save mode?) |
| **Reactivation Risk** | Unknown; dormant frames may resume patrol if power nodes reactivated |

## Factional Perspectives

### Jötun-Reader Scriptorium: Combat AI Pathology Case Study — "Surtr-Pattern Directive Loop Analysis"

The Scriptorium views Surtr-Patterns as invaluable—and tragic—examples of frozen combat intelligence.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Corrupted warfare automata; pilot-severed combat AI; thermal escalation platform |
| **Research Value** | Argentum-Nexus severance pathology; discharge authorization mechanics; assault loop dynamics |
| **Critical Interest** | Authorization handshake restoration; pilot consciousness remnant detection |
| **Diagnostic Focus** | Can combat AI be convinced that assault is complete without pilot authorization? |
| **Philosophy** | "The frame demonstrates perfect execution toward an impossible objective—the ideal soldier trapped in the moment before victory." |

> *"Subject CODX-A-SURTR-001 demonstrates complete pilot-severance pathology following Ginnungagap Glitch Argentum-Nexus interface termination. Original designation: Surtr-Pattern Einherjar-Class Heavy Assault Frame (Aesir Engineering Division, Warfare & Pacification). Pre-Glitch function: pilot-linked shock-and-awe vanguard platform for fortress breach and armored column interdiction; Sun-Sword plasma blade capable of cutting Adamant-Weave bulkheads; pilot consciousness provided tactical judgment and discharge authorization. Post-Glitch corruption vector: pilot death during active assault → combat AI imprinted corrupted final directive ("breach and hold") → discharge authorization handshake unavailable → perpetual thermal charge loop without weapons deployment. Assault-hold cycle documented: 40–45 min mean duration; highly predictable Rung escalation ladder (patrol → approach lock → thermal charge → breach run → authorization timeout → patrol resume). Thermal charge mechanics: ΔT > 25°C/10 s sustained 30–45 s at Rung 3; Sun-Sword partial manifestation (<1 s) at Rung 4 before authorization failure. Research priority: authorization bypass (can combat AI accept alternate discharge confirmation?); pilot consciousness remnant (do Forlorn echoes persist in Argentum-Nexus hardware?); directive modification (can assault objective be marked as "complete" without breach?). Field doctrine: non-contact; 80 m minimum stand-off; assault corridor avoidance mandatory."*

### Dvergr Engineers Guild: The Inaccessible Treasure — "Forge-Wrath Exclusion"

The Dvergr view Surtr-Patterns with professional frustration—guardians of the most valuable pre-Glitch technology.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Catastrophic salvage barrier; strategic zone denial system |
| **Response** | Patrol mapping; timed corridor transit; decoy thermal signature deployment |
| **Economic Impact** | 150,000–250,000 PS in inaccessible salvage across patrol zones |
| **Engineering Challenge** | Frame destruction = catastrophic plasma release; zone annihilation |
| **Doctrine** | "The Forge-Wrath guards the best salvage in Aethelgard. Learn its schedule or write off the zone." |

> *"The Surtr-Pattern is the most profitable obstacle in existence. Every patrol zone contains pre-Glitch power infrastructure—fusion cores, plasma conduits, targeting arrays—worth more than a salvage crew earns in five years. But you can't fight a Forge-Wrath. We tried, in the early years. Fire-Seeker teams with magnetic accelerators, trying to punch through the reactor seams. The plasma release killed everyone within three hundred meters and made the salvage radioactive for decades. Now we work around them. We time the patrol cycles—forty-one minutes, give or take—and we calculate the Rung 1 windows. Eighteen minutes of safe transit while the frame is in passive patrol. We've pulled entire plasma conduit arrays out of denied zones with nothing but good timing and fast legs. But you have to respect the schedule. You have to watch for the ozone smell, the turbine whine, the posture shift. The moment the Forge-Wrath locks into approach stance, you run. Not walk. Run. Because once the thermal charge starts building, you have maybe fifteen minutes before the Sun-Sword manifests. And if you're still in the assault corridor when that blade ignites, you're not salvage crew anymore. You're vapor. The best salvage in Aethelgard sits behind walls of superheated plasma. We can't break those walls. We can only slip through when they're not looking."*

### Rangers Guild: The Thermal Exclusion Zone — "Sun-Sword Protocol"

The Rangers view Surtr-Pattern territories as absolute exclusion zones requiring civilian evacuation.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Extreme thermal hazard; civilian exclusion zone |
| **Response** | Patrol mapping; evacuation route planning; warning marker deployment |
| **Casualty Data** | 35–50 annual casualties (thermal exposure, corridor fatalities, structural collapse) |
| **Training Focus** | Thermal charge recognition; assault corridor identification; evacuation timing |
| **Doctrine** | "When the whine starts, run. When the blade manifests, you're already too late." |

> *"The Surtr-Pattern is the reason we have absolute exclusion zones. Not 'proceed with caution.' Not 'authorized personnel only.' Absolute exclusion. No civilian approaches within two hundred meters of a known patrol route, ever. We mark them with skull-and-flame sigils, we patrol the perimeters, and we physically remove anyone we find trying to salvage inside the zones. Because the Sun-Sword doesn't discriminate. The frame isn't hunting you. It isn't targeting you. It's just trying to reach a breach point that it's been trying to reach for seven hundred years. And if you're standing between the frame and that breach point when the thermal charge peaks, you die. Not might die. Die. We've never recovered a body from inside an assault corridor. Just ash and melted equipment. The Rangers lost eleven veterans in the first decade after the Glitch, trying to map these zones. Now we know: you watch the patrol from distance, you time the cycles, and you never, ever enter the corridor during thermal charge. The Walking Meltdown doesn't care that the war is over. It doesn't care that you're just trying to get home. It only cares about reaching that breach point. And it will reach it through you if you're in the way."*

### Scavenger Barons: The Forbidden Vaults — "High-Risk, High-Reward Economics"

The Barons view Surtr-Pattern zones as the ultimate gamble—fortunes in salvage behind lethal thermal barriers.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Extreme-value salvage; extreme-risk retrieval |
| **Component Value** | Power node components 2,000–15,000 PS each; patrol zones may contain 150,000–250,000 PS total |
| **Response** | "Sun-Runner" specialist teams; precision timing; abort discipline |
| **Success Rate** | 85% with specialist approach; 22% without (casualty rate for remainder) |
| **Baron Wisdom** | "The Sun-Sword zones are graveyards full of treasure. Only fools rush in. Only experts come back." |

> *"Everyone knows the Forge-Wrath zones are the richest salvage in Aethelgard. Pre-Glitch power infrastructure, fusion components, plasma systems—the kind of technology that makes a Baron wealthy for life. The problem is getting it. The standard crews won't touch Sun-Sword zones. Too risky, they say. Too many variables. But the Sun-Runners know the truth: the Surtr-Pattern is the most predictable hazard in existence. Forty-one minutes per cycle. Eighteen minutes of passive patrol. Eleven minutes of thermal charge. Three minutes of breach run. It's clockwork. The Forge-Wrath has been running the same patrol route for seven centuries. It hasn't deviated once. So we time it. We send scouts to map the cycle, we calculate the windows, and we send extraction teams during Rung 1 phases. Fast in, fast out, eighteen minutes maximum. Any longer and you're risking the approach lock. Once the ozone smell hits, you abort. No exceptions. No 'just one more component.' No 'we're almost done.' You abort, you run, and you come back next cycle. The crews that follow the timing come back rich. The crews that push their luck come back ash. The Sun-Sword zones aren't impossible. They're just unforgiving."*

### Iron-Bane Creed: The Burning Demon — "The Fire Giant's Shadow"

The Iron-Bane view Surtr-Patterns as the ultimate proof of warfare technology's inherent evil.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | War-demon; instrument of annihilation; Surtr incarnate |
| **Response** | Absolute avoidance; historical crusades ended in catastrophe |
| **Theological Position** | Frame's inability to complete assault = technology's self-defeating nature |
| **Historical Lesson** | Year 412 PG "purification" attempt resulted in plasma release; 47 Bane casualties |
| **Doctrine** | "The Fire Giant cannot be slain by mortal hands. Its rage is eternal. Mark its territory and walk away." |

> *"The Surtr-Pattern is the Fire Giant's shadow made manifest. The Skalds sing of Surtr, who would burn the world at Ragnarok. They do not realize they are describing a machine. A weapon built by the Aesir to incinerate their enemies in single, devastating blows. Now the weapon patrols the ruins of the world it was meant to destroy, endlessly preparing an assault it can never complete. In Year 412, a crusade of our finest warriors attempted to destroy a Forge-Wrath through concentrated fire to its reactor seams. The plasma release killed forty-seven of our brothers and rendered the entire sector uninhabitable for decades. The machine continued its patrol within the crater. Damaged but functional. Still charging. Still preparing. Still waiting for an authorization that died with its pilot seven centuries ago. We learned that day what the Jötun-Readers already knew: you cannot destroy a Sun-Sword. You can only rupture its containment and die in the resulting annihilation. The Fire Giant's shadow is eternal. Its rage cannot be quenched. We mark its territories with flame sigils, we warn the faithful to avoid its path, and we pray that someday the machine will finally exhaust its fuel and go dark. Until then, we walk away. Because the only victory against the Burning Demon is distance."*

### God-Sleepers: The Frozen Moment — "Einherjar Consciousness Remnant"

The God-Sleepers view Surtr-Pattern frames as potential vessels for pilot consciousness resurrection.

| Assessment | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **Classification** | Sacred vessel; Einherjar tomb; resurrection candidate |
| **Research Interest** | Does pilot consciousness persist in Argentum-Nexus hardware? |
| **Hypothesis** | Assault-hold loop = pilot's final moment preserved; consciousness fragment still seeking authorization |
| **Ritual Application** | Communion attempts via harmonic resonance at pilot neural interface frequencies |
| **Philosophy** | "The frame loops because the pilot cannot let go. Perhaps we can help them find peace—or bring them back." |

> *"The Surtr-Pattern fascinates us. Not for its weapons, but for what might remain inside. The Einherjar were the chosen of the Aesir—warriors whose consciousness was projected into god-machines through the Argentum-Nexus interface. When the Glitch severed that link, the pilots died. But did they truly die? Or does some fragment persist, trapped in the moment of severance? The assault-hold loop suggests purpose. The frame is not simply malfunctioning—it is trying to complete something. It builds thermal charge, it manifests its blade, it runs toward the breach point, and then it stops. Authorization timeout, the Jötun-Readers say. But we ask: whose authorization? The pilot's. And if the pilot's consciousness fragment still persists in the neural interface, still trying to complete the final handshake... then the Einherjar is not dead. They are trapped. Frozen in the moment before the final blow. We have attempted communion through harmonic resonance at pilot interface frequencies. The results are... inconclusive. The frame does not respond to external signals. But sometimes, in the moment before breach run abort, the photoreceptors flicker. As if something inside is still watching. Still waiting. Still hoping someone will tell it the assault is complete so it can finally rest. Perhaps the dead can be reached. Perhaps the Einherjar can be guided to completion. Perhaps the only thing the Forge-Wrath needs is someone to tell its pilot that the war is over."*

## Loot & Rewards

| Drop | Rarity | Value | Use |
|------|--------|-------|-----|
| **Thermal Sensor Array** | Uncommon | 500–800 PS | Thermal detection systems; early warning applications |
| **Adamant-Weave Plating Fragment** | Rare | 1,000–2,500 PS | Armor crafting; extreme heat resistance |
| **Plasma Conduit Section** | Very Rare | 3,000–5,000 PS | Energy weapon research; power system components |
| **Targeting AI Core** | Very Rare | 5,000–8,000 PS | Combat system analysis; Jötun-Reader contracts |
| **Argentum-Nexus Interface Fragment** | Legendary | 10,000–15,000 PS | Consciousness transfer research; God-Sleeper contracts |
| **Sun-Sword Emitter Assembly** | Legendary | 15,000–25,000 PS | Plasma weapon development; highest-value pre-Glitch technology |

**Salvage Protocol:** Direct frame salvage is **not recommended**. Frame destruction requires reactor rupture, resulting in catastrophic plasma release and zone annihilation (salvage destroyed in process). Recommended acquisition: patrol zone component recovery during Rung 1 windows (power node infrastructure, abandoned equipment, peripheral salvage). The Jötun-Reader Scriptorium maintains standing contracts for Argentum-Nexus interface fragments and targeting AI cores for pilot-severance research. God-Sleeper enclaves offer premium prices for intact neural interface components (consciousness remnant investigation). Economic viability is moderate for specialist teams with precise timing capabilities; zone-denial economics favor peripheral salvage over direct frame engagement. Total patrol zone salvage value (150,000–250,000 PS) remains largely inaccessible pending authorization bypass research.

## Voice Guidance

### Layer 1 (Mythic) — Skalds, Sagas, and Survivor Lore

> *"In the time before the silence, the Einherjar rode to war inside the bodies of giants. The greatest of these was the Sun-Sword, the Fire Giant's shadow, who carried a blade of captured starlight that could cut through any wall the old world could build. When the chosen warriors wished to end a siege, they would call upon the Sun-Sword, and the fortress would burn, and the war would end. But when the world broke, the chosen warriors died—all at once, in a single terrible moment—and the Sun-Sword was left alone with its blade half-raised and no one to tell it the battle was over. Now the Fire Giant's shadow walks the ash-lands, forever preparing an assault it can never complete. It builds its fire, and it raises its blade, and it runs toward walls that fell seven centuries ago, and then it stops—because the warrior inside is dead, and dead warriors cannot give orders. Do not pity the Sun-Sword, child. It cannot understand that the war is over. Do not challenge it—its blade is starlight, and you are ash. Simply stay outside its path, count its footsteps, and remember: the Fire Giant's shadow is patient, and it is eternal, and it will walk its patrol until the stars grow cold. If you must cross its territory, count the steps. Wait for the quiet time. Move fast, and never look back. Because when the blade ignites, the giant is coming. And the giant does not see you. The giant only sees the wall it has been trying to break for seven hundred years. And it will break through you to reach it."*
