## I. Design Context (Layer 4)

### Core Design Intent

Keeper of Oaths is the Thul's **premier ally buff**—a powerful invocation of ancient oaths that grants [Inspired] AND Fear immunity. This establishes the Thul as capable of empowering allies, not just debuffing enemies.

### Mechanical Role

- **Primary:** Grant [Inspired] status (+2 damage dice) for 3 rounds
- **Secondary:** Grant immunity to [Fear] for duration
- **Fantasy Delivery:** The solemn reminder of sworn duties that fills an ally with purpose

### Balance Considerations

- **Power Level:** Very high (dual buff: damage + immunity)
- **Single Target:** Concentrated power on one ally
- **Higher Cost:** 55 Stamina reflects premium buff

---

## II. Narrative Context (Layer 2)

### In-World Framing

The Thul speaks—not tactical guidance this time, but something older. They invoke an **ancient oath**, a sworn duty that transcends fear and doubt. Perhaps it is the ally's oath to their clan, or a promise made to a fallen comrade, or simply the fundamental vow to survive.

The words are not magical, but they are **absolute**. The ally remembers why they fight. They remember what they swore. And in that remembering, fear becomes irrelevant.

### Thematic Resonance

Oaths in Aethelgard are binding—not mystically, but psychologically. The Thul, as keeper of histories, knows all the oaths ever sworn. They can remind any warrior of their deepest commitments, and in that reminder, grant them unshakeable purpose.

## III. Mechanical Specification (Layer 3)

### Activation

- **Action Type:** Standard Action
- **Cost:** 55 Stamina
- **Range:** 6 meters (voice range)
- **Target:** Single ally

### Effect

**Target ally gains for 3 rounds:**

1. **[Inspired] Status:**
    - +2 damage dice to all damage rolls
    - Duration: 3 rounds
2. **[Fear] Immunity:**
    - Cannot be affected by [Fear] status effects
    - Automatically succeeds on [Fear] Resolve Checks
    - Duration: 3 rounds

### Resolution Pipeline

1. **Targeting:** Thul selects ally within 6 meters
2. **Cost Payment:** Thul spends 55 Stamina
3. **Buff Application:** Target gains [Inspired] and [Fear Immunity]
4. **Duration Track:** Both effects last 3 rounds
5. **Expiration:** Remove both statuses when duration ends

### Edge Cases

- **Already [Inspired]:** Refreshes duration, does not stack damage bonus
- **Already [Feared]:** [Fear] is immediately removed upon buff application
- **Stacking with other damage buffs:** [Inspired] stacks with non-[Inspired] damage bonuses

## V. Tactical Applications

1. **Damage Amplification:** +2 damage dice is massive multiplier
2. **Fear Immunity:** Essential before entering fear-heavy encounters
3. **Berserkr Enhancement:** Already high damage + [Inspired] = devastating
4. **Boss Fights:** Sustained damage boost over multiple rounds
5. **Psychological Warfare Counter:** Immunity to enemy mental tactics

---

## VI. Synergies & Interactions

### Positive Synergies

- **Berserkr:** [Inspired] on already high damage = extreme output; Fear immunity protects low WILL
- **Strandhögg:** Burst damage specialists benefit massively
- **Veiðimaðr:** Ranged damage amplified over multiple turns
- **Skjaldmær:** Fear immunity redundant but damage boost helps tank contribute

### Negative Synergies

- **Support characters:** Damage boost wasted on non-damage dealers
- **Short fights:** May not last full 3 rounds
- **Action economy:** Standard Action for single-target buff is expensive
